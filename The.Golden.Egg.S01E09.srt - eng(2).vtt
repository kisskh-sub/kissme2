WEBVTT

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.911
Okay.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.250
I'll show you what she gave me.

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:15.120
Huh?

00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:20.425
I have it at home though,
so it'll take a little while.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.797
We could do it at the Sengokusha office,
in our reception room.

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:28.967
Nobody would see us there,
so it would be safe.

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:33.104
Thank you.

00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:53.725
Wow, I'm relieved you met up
with Niko-chan.

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:57.529
So, how was your first marriage mixer?

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:59.597
I didn't have time for the mixer,

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:02.567
but I managed to blend in
thanks to Ms. Iijima.

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:04.736
Hats off to her for sure.

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:06.771
It looks good on you.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.509
Actually, there was a tiny incident.

00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:14.746
Have you been entrusted with something?

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:16.414
I thought that was you.

00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:17.649
Give me the envelope, now!

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:20.151
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:22.687
I'll be taking this.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:27.025
You said you were visually impaired!

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:33.464
That's more than just a tiny incident!

00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:36.935
Tell me everything you remember
about that man.

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:37.869
Okay.

00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:39.971
I only vaguely remember the details.

00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:55.019
He was like this.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.625
I'm sure it was neither Kubozuka
or Aoshiro, barring plastic surgery.

00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:03.761
So we have another player.

00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:07.532
You mean all three are connected
to the case?

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.937
Well, the more people involved in a crime,
the greater the chance of getting caught.

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:14.973
So fewer is always better.

00:02:15.573 --> 00:02:17.642
Mr. Aoshiro has an alibi, right?

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:19.310
He does.

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:22.347
But we can't rule him out of
being involved somehow.

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.952
Because these two are
from the same hometown.

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:32.257
I actually went to Niigata yesterday.

00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:37.195
I managed to talk to a few of Aoshiro's
high school classmates.

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:38.096
Huh?

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:44.802
The father of one of our classmates ran
a company more successful than Aoshiro's.

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:49.274
But one day, the local delinquents
started targeting him, beating him up.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.944
Nobody would believe me,
but Aoshiro was behind it.

00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:56.014
He ordered the delinquents to do it.

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:59.150
What do you think?

00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:02.020
Mr. Aoshiro was jealous?

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:03.121
Exactly.

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:08.159
I was introduced to his other friends
and asked them questions, too.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.795
They all said the same thing.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.931
"I bet nobody would believe me."

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.034
"I don't have any proof, but…"

00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:19.003
And finally, they said this.

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:22.307
Just between us,

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:26.544
everyone who got in his way
met a tragic fate.

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:33.818
The reason I can't rule Aoshiro out is
because I discovered this side of him.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.788
It's hard for me to believe.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:39.457
But they're just rumors, right?

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:44.028
Isn't there a chance
they're slandering him out of jealousy?

00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:45.263
You have a point.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.066
To be honest, I found him
to sound pretty fishy,

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:52.170
but maybe he's just easily misunderstood
in that way.

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:55.540
Does that mean Kubozuka
likely did this all by himself?

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:56.774
The interesting thing is,

00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.510
I asked around about Kubozuka, too.

00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:01.913
They all said the same thing again.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.182
That he was a likeable guy.

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.883
What?

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.022
So if Aoshiro isn't involved,
and Kubozuka is innocent,

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.991
I thought there could be another culprit.

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:14.926
And then…

00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:17.662
Sunglasses Man showed up.

00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:23.234
Well, it doesn't mean the information
I found out is true.

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.672
As you said, they're just rumors.

00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:33.411
I don't want anything coloring my judgment

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.280
and remain skeptical.

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:39.150
Ms. Shinoda.

00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:41.953
You've grown.

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:42.854
Huh?

00:05:09.147 --> 00:05:14.051
I'd like you to approach them
by saying her mother asked you

00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:16.254
to look for your missing classmate.

00:05:17.622 --> 00:05:19.390
Sounds like great work!

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.359
Shinoda, you can pull off disguises.

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:23.027
Is it working?

00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:40.311
Shinoda, I want you and Suzaki to pretend
to be a flirty couple.

00:05:40.378 --> 00:05:42.647
I guess I gotta kill it.

00:05:42.713 --> 00:05:44.048
I'm sorry!

00:06:06.037 --> 00:06:08.539
I'm scared. This is way too scary.

00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:11.976
I'm Shinoda, a writer
for the Sengoku Weekly.

00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:13.744
Is it still a scoop?

00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:16.214
I got it from here.

00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:17.648
Good work.

00:06:37.468 --> 00:06:38.870
He gave the okay!

00:06:39.604 --> 00:06:40.838
Nice one.

00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:43.574
Just like you were in your letter,

00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.377
I'm curious to know
where your warmth comes from.

00:06:47.778 --> 00:06:52.216
If you would like to meet up again
sometime, this is my private information.

00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:54.752
You really did a great job.

00:06:55.753 --> 00:06:56.621
Thank you.

00:07:01.926 --> 00:07:02.827
Right.

00:07:05.396 --> 00:07:07.031
I guess I have grown.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.665
This is what she gave me.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.201
Data of some sort?

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.738
Photography was her hobby.

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:56.147
Unfortunately, there are so many pictures,
I don't know which ones are relevant.

00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:58.316
How many are there?

00:07:58.382 --> 00:07:59.550
About 2,000?

00:08:01.085 --> 00:08:02.353
Can I look at them?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.287
Of course.

00:08:06.724 --> 00:08:09.794
Do you think one of them
is the money shot?

00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:12.930
Best place to hide a tree
is in the forest.

00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:14.932
Something that looks only scenic

00:08:14.999 --> 00:08:17.935
could have something hidden in it.

00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:22.106
Tanioka was using it to blackmail someone.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.876
There's a good chance
that's what got her killed.

00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:28.946
Is there really such a damning photo

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:31.382
among all these?

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:34.018
Wait.

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:37.588
There's something odd about this picture.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:42.126
Mr. Murai!

00:08:43.995 --> 00:08:44.962
Is this?

00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:56.407
Earlier today, we met up with
a man named Niko-chan

00:08:56.474 --> 00:08:59.176
who was friends with the third
victim Tanioka.

00:08:59.243 --> 00:09:00.077
Niko-chan?

00:09:00.578 --> 00:09:03.014
The place he lives in
is colloquially called "Nikotama."

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:08.386
Right before her death, Ms. Tanioka gave
Niko-chan a USB-stick as insurance.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.656
And this was one of the pictures.

00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:18.129
Aoshiro!

00:09:18.663 --> 00:09:20.297
Huh? How can you tell?

00:09:20.998 --> 00:09:22.566
I've been after him a while.

00:09:22.633 --> 00:09:23.868
Good eye, Suzaki.

00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:26.103
It was indeed Seiya Aoshiro.

00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:27.705
Which means

00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:32.410
Makiko Tanioka and Seiya Aoshiro
were connected.

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:36.547
There was another curious picture,
which is this one.

00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:39.784
It's Aoshiro again.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.619
But, who's the man with him?

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:46.023
This man resembles the person
Shinoda met at the marriage mixer.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.458
We don't know who he is.

00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:52.029
These pictures were taken one week
after the second death.

00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:58.836
My guess is that Tanioka concluded
Aoshiro was involved and blackmailed him.

00:09:58.903 --> 00:10:04.675
So you're saying Aoshiro killed her
over these pictures?

00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:06.310
No, but it is a possibility.

00:10:07.044 --> 00:10:10.748
Ms. Tanioka told Niko-chan that she found
a rich man to blackmail, before she died.

00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:14.251
It makes for a compelling case
if Aoshiro was this mark.

00:10:14.318 --> 00:10:18.522
If this sunglasses guy was at the party,
we should be able to find him.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.327
If he's involved somehow,
how did he get into the party?

00:10:23.928 --> 00:10:25.162
Can you look into it?

00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:27.298
Okay, I'll ask the party organizers.

00:10:27.364 --> 00:10:31.102
And I'll ask my stylist contact if they
know who this guy is.

00:10:31.168 --> 00:10:35.573
Got it. So Dai, I want you to find how
Aoshiro and Tanioka were connected.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:36.640
-Okay.
-Then…

00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.542
Where's Akutsu?

00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:40.511
The bathroom. He ate too much.

00:10:40.578 --> 00:10:42.680
Tell him to stake out Aoshiro.

00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:43.614
Okay.

00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:45.549
And Su,

00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:47.485
I want you to be at the ready.

00:10:48.052 --> 00:10:48.986
You got it.

00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:52.823
Shinoda, find out with Tama-chan
who Tanioka was friends with.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.724
Yes, sir.

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.994
But be careful.

00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:59.730
The culprit's attacked
three women already.

00:10:59.797 --> 00:11:01.565
Make sure not to act alone.

00:11:01.632 --> 00:11:03.667
Warn Tama-chan, too.

00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:04.902
It's Niko-chan.

00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:05.903
Huh? What?

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.038
You've been saying Tama-chan
all this time.

00:11:14.712 --> 00:11:16.213
Are you okay with the time?

00:11:17.014 --> 00:11:19.717
Afternoon hours don't start
until 1:00 p.m..

00:11:20.317 --> 00:11:21.819
Thank you.

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:25.890
We'll do whatever it takes to find
this sunglasses man.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:28.459
Tell me.

00:11:29.026 --> 00:11:32.229
Why's a tabloid so hellbent on this?

00:11:33.664 --> 00:11:38.669
I mean, you've lost a friend.
We need to find out the truth.

00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:45.643
But if I'm being honest,
we have our motives as a publication.

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:52.817
If we secure solid evidence
on a wanted fugitive,

00:11:52.883 --> 00:11:55.219
it would make for a sensational article.

00:11:55.853 --> 00:11:59.757
My mentor said
being the first to break the case is huge.

00:12:04.428 --> 00:12:07.531
Whoever can write first about a fugitive,

00:12:07.598 --> 00:12:10.434
no matter how trivial the content is,

00:12:10.968 --> 00:12:13.504
is a winner in this business.

00:12:14.972 --> 00:12:19.310
If someone beats us to it,
no matter what we publish, it's too late.

00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:29.153
Given the scope and the notoriety,
even follow-up reports will sell.

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:35.659
Part of it is that we're desperately
trying not to get out-scooped.

00:12:38.062 --> 00:12:39.363
You're so honest.

00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:42.166
Just let me know if I can help.

00:12:43.634 --> 00:12:45.002
Thank you.

00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:48.539
Seagulls!

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.109
-What? Where?
-There.

00:12:55.913 --> 00:12:57.214
Sorry I'm late.

00:12:57.815 --> 00:12:59.183
Glad you made it.

00:12:59.817 --> 00:13:00.718
Thanks.

00:13:02.653 --> 00:13:04.688
Could I have the same?

00:13:04.755 --> 00:13:05.623
Coming up.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.059
So? What were you investigating?

00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:11.829
That serial mysterious deaths case.

00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:14.598
How did the undercover work go?

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:16.634
It was crazy.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.369
But there was progress.

00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:21.105
The whole Incident Team
is working on this.

00:14:08.352 --> 00:14:10.788
So listen, I had this thought.

00:14:11.422 --> 00:14:16.393
How would you feel if Sengokusha
pulled out of the tabloid game?

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.428
Will they?

00:14:17.494 --> 00:14:18.729
No, hypothetically.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.465
What if it discontinued?

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:26.203
I would've had an answer in April.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.273
Did something change since then?

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.174
A little.

00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:33.010
What about you, did something happen?

00:14:34.778 --> 00:14:35.612
Yeah.

00:14:36.714 --> 00:14:39.717
It's one of the new novels
that was brought in.

00:14:42.553 --> 00:14:43.721
A manuscript!

00:14:44.822 --> 00:14:46.457
When I read a manuscript like this,

00:14:47.157 --> 00:14:52.429
it helps me realize there's a real person
behind the words.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.167
This novel especially
since it's going for realism.

00:14:57.234 --> 00:15:00.237
The life it depicts
doesn't seem fabricated.

00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:02.206
That's why…

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:04.808
Yeah?

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.243
Like I mentioned before,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:12.182
I'm convinced that novels and tabloids
aren't that far apart.

00:15:13.584 --> 00:15:16.220
I mean, reading this
gave me a stomachache.

00:15:17.554 --> 00:15:21.625
This pain was carried over from
my time at the Sengoku Weekly.

00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:23.794
What about you?

00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:27.731
Would you feel relieved if Sengokusha
dropped the tabloid?

00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:29.199
Well.

00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:32.036
I'd become uneasy.

00:15:32.603 --> 00:15:33.437
Uneasy?

00:15:34.571 --> 00:15:39.510
Novels and tabloids both explore reality
from different sides.

00:15:41.278 --> 00:15:44.181
If you throw away one,
you halve the effort.

00:15:44.248 --> 00:15:47.317
That's a questionable move
for a publisher.

00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:49.653
What do you mean?

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.625
In other words, novels only cover
topics picked by the authors,

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:57.795
but tabloids can cover anything.

00:15:58.395 --> 00:16:04.001
I mean, they're selective to an extent,
but most of it isn't pretty or perfect.

00:16:05.869 --> 00:16:08.105
Sorry, could you say that again?

00:16:09.973 --> 00:16:11.775
This probably isn't the place.

00:16:12.376 --> 00:16:15.546
So you're saying if
the Sengoku Weekly got pulled,

00:16:16.113 --> 00:16:19.516
these not so pretty things
wouldn't see the light of day?

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:22.886
Yes! And maybe that's where
my uneasiness comes from.

00:16:24.254 --> 00:16:25.389
I see.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.258
What a serious thing to think about.

00:16:28.325 --> 00:16:33.864
This is all because you asked
what the purpose of tabloids was!

00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:35.899
You thought about it for me?

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:37.534
Thank you.

00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:39.736
Am I too serious?

00:16:41.238 --> 00:16:42.272
Sorry.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:51.115
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:17:19.176 --> 00:17:22.246
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:39.496
I couldn't manage to find
a connection between Tanioka and Aoshiro.

00:17:40.164 --> 00:17:42.199
If that's the case,

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:45.802
was her blackmail target
the sunglasses man instead?

00:17:46.403 --> 00:17:50.073
It comes down to if he has money
worth shaking down.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.545
I'm having my stylist contact ask around
about the sunglasses man.

00:17:54.611 --> 00:17:56.213
Got it, how about the mixer?

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.216
After hearing we had a reporter
go in undercover,

00:17:59.283 --> 00:18:01.785
they begged us not to mention them
in an article.

00:18:01.852 --> 00:18:06.990
They agreed to check if
the sunglasses man is a member.

00:18:07.057 --> 00:18:08.091
Okay, Akutsu.

00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:09.826
How's tailing Aoshiro?

00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:13.397
I found out the Truth Weekly
is tailing him, too.

00:18:13.463 --> 00:18:15.232
Are you serious?

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:16.833
It was definitely the Truth.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.035
What do we do?

00:18:21.705 --> 00:18:24.341
Stay on Aoshiro and
check out that reporter.

00:18:24.408 --> 00:18:25.309
Yes, sir.

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.911
And Su, you're on standby.

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:29.713
Standby?

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.550
Dai, I want you to switch to
investigating Kubozuka.

00:18:33.617 --> 00:18:35.385
How's he funding his escape?

00:18:35.452 --> 00:18:38.922
Try to take into account Aoshiro and
Sunglasses' possible involvement.

00:18:38.989 --> 00:18:41.024
-Find a new perspective.
-Copy that.

00:18:42.426 --> 00:18:44.461
-Mr. Murai.
-What is it?

00:18:44.528 --> 00:18:47.030
Please tell me Madoka Hashimoto's
home address.

00:18:47.798 --> 00:18:51.668
I want to ask her parents
if they've heard from her.

00:18:51.735 --> 00:18:54.137
I doubt they'd talk to a tabloid.

00:18:56.139 --> 00:18:58.709
Have them look at Ms. Tanioka's
photos then?

00:18:58.775 --> 00:19:01.144
They might know something.

00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:05.782
It's worth chasing down any possibility,

00:19:05.849 --> 00:19:08.919
but we're the only ones
with these crucial pictures.

00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:10.387
Not even the cops have it.

00:19:11.021 --> 00:19:12.723
We'd need them to stay quiet.

00:19:13.323 --> 00:19:16.860
They can't even tell the cops
they saw these pictures.

00:19:16.927 --> 00:19:19.096
So better not show them.

00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:20.530
Sorry.

00:19:21.098 --> 00:19:22.232
You know what?

00:19:23.267 --> 00:19:24.701
I'll leave it to you.

00:19:26.303 --> 00:19:29.906
Even if they went to the police,
they won't take action immediately.

00:19:29.973 --> 00:19:35.245
If they come question us,
me and Mr. Murai make ourselves scarce.

00:19:35.312 --> 00:19:36.313
Right?

00:19:37.447 --> 00:19:40.117
Either way, we have to go hard and fast.

00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:43.287
I'm not letting the Truth Weekly
getting ahead of us!

00:19:43.353 --> 00:19:45.122
Shinoda, give it a shot.

00:19:45.889 --> 00:19:46.723
Yes, sir!

00:19:47.424 --> 00:19:48.892
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:49.526 --> 00:19:52.362
You're doing this
to write a tabloid piece?

00:19:52.429 --> 00:19:54.398
One wrong move and we'll get sued.

00:19:54.464 --> 00:19:56.166
I want you to find a star.

00:19:56.233 --> 00:19:58.068
He looks somewhat similar.

00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:59.403
A shady hobby?

00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:00.904
The type of hobby I can't share.

00:20:02.205 --> 00:20:04.875
