What's wrong?

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.540
I have this feeling.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.379
You're the one I love.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.379
I told you.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:17.739
It's your imagination.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.959
Cheng Nuo,

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:22.060
I don't want to hurt you.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:24.719
But Bai Cha

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:26.420
is already dead.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:31.819
When will you face this reality?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.879
No.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.640
With Bai Cha's face,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.620
as long as you live,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.219
she lives.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.140
I'm not her.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.939
Not her.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:32.500
Honey,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.740
I miss you so much.

Honey,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.819

look at me.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.540
Look at the face

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.060
of the one you loved most.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.819
Remember what you said?

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.019
"As long as I live,

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:22.620
Bai Cha lives."

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:26.699
Will you really destroy

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.519
her last remaining trace in this world

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.600
because of this demon?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.300
You can't do this.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.379
But this animal

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.100
must die!

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.720
Cheng Nuo!

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.279
Bai Cha loved you.

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.000
She wanted you to have a happy life.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.220
This face

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.540
was her final gift to you.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.800
Call the police.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.279
Let him face proper judgment.

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:02.339
Okay?

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.600
Hello?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.139
Mr. Luo?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.279
Someone here

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:28.759
wants to surrender.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.139
Who's surrendering?

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:44.740
It's me.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:51.220
Where's Ye Dong?

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.360
Ye Dong escaped.

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:57.899
Go.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.019
Follow me.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.899
Hello?

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.259
Master,

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:31.980
a car hit Ye Dong.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:32.699
What do we do?

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:35.100
What now?

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:36.860
Either send him

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:38.319
to the hospital

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.779
or a crematorium.

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:42.800
I didn't mean to.

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:44.899
Judging by this,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.180
we'll need the latter option.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.740
My daughter has classes

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.459
every day.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.699
Saturday's her only free day.

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.220
Today was supposed

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.980
to be the movie day with her.

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:08.860
Ye Dong was reported,

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:10.379
so I came.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:15.839
I'm sorry.

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:17.339
I caused you trouble.

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:21.420
Everyone should fulfill their role.

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:23.980
A student studies.

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:25.459
A policeman

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.139
upholds justice.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.579
This is my job.

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:30.060
My passion.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.340
I find joy in it.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.539
Except emotions must not be involved.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.700
Love's absence safeguards everything.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.820
How many people

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:41.980
in this mortal world

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:44.019
can truly achieve this?

00:09:01.344 --> 00:09:04.688
(All those involved in the case
were penalized according to local laws)

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.019
(Three months ago)
Ai Li,

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.220
you're Bai Cha's best friend.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.120
How do you not know where she is?

00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:13.440
If you just talk,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.539
you can end this.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.299
Why be so stubborn?

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.059
Bai Cha

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.379
is dead.

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:24.779
Why won't you tell the truth?

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:26.899
I've never seen such a tough nut.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.259
Wretch.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.679
Say it.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.379
Bai Cha is dead.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.799
Say it!

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:47.259
Dong,

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:48.659
could Bai Cha

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.419
really be dead?

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.940
Impossible.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.220
If Bai Cha were really dead,

00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:56.279
Cheng Nuo

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.639
would've gone mad by now.

00:09:58.899 --> 00:09:59.659
But today,

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:01.539
he smiled at me.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.240
I'm not lying to you.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.059
She's dead.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.100
I never expected

00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:13.139
your relationship to be this good.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.039
Since you're so eager to die,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.179
I'll grant your wish.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.200
No.

00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:21.659
Throw her into the river.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:22.600
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.019
No!

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:24.700
No!

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.779
Let me go!

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.419
Let me go!

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:28.899
No!

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:29.539
Help!

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.820
Help me!

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:33.679
Help me!

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.440
Tell me.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.600
Was Ye Dong's death

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.460
a traffic accident

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.240
or a hit job?

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:47.559
Cheng Nuo?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.639
Or Lin Xia?

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.059
I've said it countless times.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.539
This was an accident.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.259
Even if it wasn't,

00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:58.220
it was heaven claiming that demon.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.059
Is there any chance

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:04.220
that someone

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:05.179
has leverage over you?

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.700
They ordered you

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:08.700
to hit Ye Dong?

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.899
No.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.139
There's nothing.

00:11:12.659 --> 00:11:13.700
It was an accident.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.259
No leverage exists.
