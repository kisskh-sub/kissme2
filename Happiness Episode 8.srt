Yes, I am.

Trust me when it comes to the weather.

A friend works for the National Weather Service.

19

Even he asks me about the weather.

20
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,815
I'm more accurate than them.

we'll be the first to go down.

00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:55,175
Even so, going into someone else's home...

28
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,876
is just not right.

29
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:01,785
Hello, you two.

30
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,486
Can you hear us out?

(SY Home Cleaning)

32

The second floor is dangerous.

33
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,466
We're right above the lobby.

34
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:15,096
So we want to stay there instead.

35
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:17,266
Can you tell her it's fine?

36
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,805
Some fool left food waste on the first floor,

37
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:21,406
and it stinks so much.

38
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:25,546
You just need to talk to me,
the resident representative.

39
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:28,145
You're saying
you want to move to the 11th floor.

40
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,145
Isn't the door locked?

41
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:33,346
We cleaned Unit 1102 not long ago.

42
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:35,315
The passcode is still 8888.

43
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:38,456
We'll clean it up again
when we leave in three days.

44
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41,025
Are you against it, Ms. Oh?

45
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,796
There could be legal repercussions,

46
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:47,326
and the 11th floor is the Royal Floor.

47
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:49,996
It won't feel right to let the cleaners stay.

48
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,466
Wouldn't the residents mind?

49
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,906
Why don't we ask the other residents?

50
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,375
There's a lawyer among them too.

51
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:01,816
As a lawyer, I would like to say
it's not recommended.

52
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,046
Entering someone's home without permission...

53
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:05,316
is breaking and entering.

54
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,585
More than two is aggravated breaking and entering.

55
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,456
It's unrelated to the homeowner's will,

56
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:12,125
so anyone can report it
even if the homeowner's lenient.

57
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,486
By the way,

58
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:18,895
and I do feel bad
about having to say this,

59
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:20,625
but you two.

60
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:23,036
If you move upstairs,

61
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,905
my family will be the one
on the lowest floor.

62
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,736
Why should we stand guard for you?

63
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,905
You're giving me that weird look again.

64
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:35,006
I live with my old wife.

65
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:39,386
If you young people were to stay below us,

66
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,145
what's so bad about that?

67
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,286
Listen. We...

68
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:48,025
Mr. Oh, you joined us so reluctantly.

69
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:50,025
Why don't you speak up?

70
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:54,326
I think you can stay here, mister.

71
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:58,805
If you stand guard down here like a guard dog,

72
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,976
the residents can relax
and everyone will be happy.

73
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:03,236
What are you saying?

74
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,335
- What was that?
- Don't.

75
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,076
- Don't do it.
- Relax.

76
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:09,016
Calm down and get back to your cleaning.

77
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:16,516
It's three more days at most.

78
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:18,386
Let's hang in there a little longer.

79
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,956
Everyone's struggling.

80
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,895
I can't give you two any special treatment.

81
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:26,395
Where should we leave our trash?

82
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:29,335
Even if we put it in the stairwell,
it still smells.

83
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,666
You didn't...

84
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,976
throw it out the window, did you?

85
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:41,046
Did someone do that?

86
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:42,476
I hope not.

87
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:46,685
If anyone needs more water,

88
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,486
leave some containers on the rooftop.

89
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,185
I told Unit 401,

90
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,386
but it'll rain tonight.

91
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,085
How do you know that?

92
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,655
Are you connected to the Internet?

93
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:55,726
Well...

94
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:59,365
He's a human weather service.

95
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,796
He could've been a major leaguer,

96
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,296
but he hurt his knee and...

97
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:04,895
- Maybe not a major leaguer...
- Oh, dear.

98
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:07,866
You're still young.
I feel sorry for you.

99
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,576
You should...

100
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:12,806
exercise your legs every now and then.

101
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:13,876
Right.

102
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,645
I should do that.

103
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:17,915
You should exercise more.

104
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,446
Not you too.

105
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:21,516
Excuse me.

106
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:24,386
I have something to tell you.

107
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,085
It's about my brother.

108
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,335
He's not here.

109
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:46,905
Right?

110
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:48,576
He can't be here.

111
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,886
I got worried, you see.

112
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:05,665
My brother contacted me.

113
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,535
Yesterday, with that,
before the power cut.

114
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:13,735
He looked okay.

115
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,636
He always had a strong immune system.

116
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:18,176
He rarely caught a cold.

117
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,376
Do you think...

118
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,746
there's a possibility he's not infected?

119
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,456
I hope so.

120
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,016
Human weather service.

121
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:03,186
See? I said it would rain.

122
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,826
Go back to sleep. I'll rush up and back.

123
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,186
It's fine. I'm awake anyway.

124
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:09,626
Let's get some water and flush the toilet.

125
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:10,795
I don't like the feel.

126
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,795
We can put the container back too.

127
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,366
Who knows when it'll rain again?

128
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,795
When will it rain?

129
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:20,905
It's raining right now.

130
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,206
- You devil.
- My gosh.

131
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,275
Get away from me.

132
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:27,645
He'll drive me insane.

133
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:36,285
What is this?

134
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,215
He has a religion now.

135
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,355
He even prays before going to sleep.

136
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:44,155
Does he pray properly?

137
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,395
Let's go.

138
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:56,006
Get away from me, devil.

139
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:09,186
It's raining.

140
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:12,155
Should we collect some water?

141
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,126
Heavy metals, fine dust, pollutants.

142
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:20,126
There's no way I'm drinking rainwater.

143
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,866
Or the water in the bathtub.

144
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:24,335
We'll be out in three days.

145
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:26,235
What's your problem?

146
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:29,936
You never know.

147
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:12,645
Soo Min.

148
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:14,145
Soo Min.

149
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:15,956
- My gosh.
- Soo Min.

150
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:18,855
Soo Min.

151
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,696
- Is that you?
- Hyun Kyung?

152
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,855
Hey. What are you doing down here?

153
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,926
You should go upstairs.

154
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:30,465
Wait. Don't go. Let's talk.

155
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:45,546
Is it serious?

156
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:49,956
Are you sure you are infected?

157
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:51,985
I'm not sure.

158
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,326
I just feel a bit...

159
00:09:58,796 --> 00:09:59,865
weird.

160
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:02,566
Did you eat?
Did you have anything to eat?

161
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,215
Hey.

162
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,085
That's ours.

163
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:22,816
Don't you have water in your unit?

164
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:28,896
You didn't even ask for our permission.

165
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:31,196
That's fine. Nobody owns rainwater.

166
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,026
If you want more water, go ahead.

167
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,105
Hey, you can't just drink that.

168
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,406
Gosh. It's fine.

169
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:48,475
I even filled up on muddy water
during my tactical training.

170
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,225
(Unit 1501, Kim Se Hoon)

171
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,755
No one will steal yours at least.

172
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,625
Wait. Do you even drink rainwater?

173
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,296
After I purify it.

174
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:12,465
I have water purification tablets.
Drop by if you need any.

175
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:16,335
Make sure to tell your husband beforehand.

176
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:25,076
I'll be going to his unit.

177
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:26,515
You cannot go there alone.

178
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,345
Don't worry.

179
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,585
He even purifies rainwater before drinking it.

180
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,526
No way he took the pills from the gym.

181
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:37,995
What should we eat for dinner?

182
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,465
We just ate.

183
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,335
When I have lunch,
I think about what to eat the next day.

184
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,906
Anticipation for my next meal
will make the food tastier.

185
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,105
Amazing.

186
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,206
- Hello.
- Hi.

187
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,936
You're still working?

188
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:54,706
Staying at home feels stuffy.

189
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:56,715
And the resident representative...

190
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,245
told me that I had to keep working
if I wanted to get paid.

191
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,585
That woman is just so awful.

192
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:04,885
By the way,

193
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,686
I found something odd.

194
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,385
What is it?

195
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,666
Where did you find this?

196
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:22,975
In a trash bag.

197
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:29,345
The trash bag is only filled up halfway.

198
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:33,085
I guess they must have
a lot of trash bags at home.

199
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,115
What is this?

200
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,916
Where did you find that trash bag?

201
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,725
On the staircase
between the third and fourth floor.

202
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:46,196
She was fine up until yesterday.

203
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:48,396
Don't make it obvious.

204
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:51,135
I'll question her
since I'm the detective here.

205
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:52,666
I'll use my advanced investigative methods.

206
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,335
Be nice.

207
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:56,505
She still must be in shock.

208
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,036
Don't worry.

209
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,176
Hello.

210
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:10,985
Do you need anything?

211
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:12,625
I'm good for now.

212
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:14,786
What brings you here?

213
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,066
We came here because of the trash.

214
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:29,975
You threw this out, didn't you?

215
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:31,735
No!

216
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:34,245
I didn't get hurt!
I'm telling the truth!

217
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,505
Look.

218
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,015
- I'm fine. Look.
- Gosh. You're fine.

219
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,416
I didn't get bitten.

220
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,786
I'm really not infected.

221
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,156
Advanced investigative methods?

222
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,156
Goodness. Unbelievable.

223
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:53,365
It's better to be blunt about it.

224
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,536
I don't think Ms. Na threw it out.

225
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,875
Her brother.

226
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,245
Where could he be now?

227
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:21,456
Hey.

228
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,595
You should have brought Sae Bom.
Why did you ask me?

229
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,995
You said you couldn't lend us your gun.

230
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:29,166
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:32,235
I feel anxious without my gun.

232
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,765
Right. So we should do it.

233
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,255
(Infectious Disease Emergency Relief Goods)

234
00:14:58,326 --> 00:14:59,995
We gave that out.

235
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:02,396
Why is it here?

236
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,735
We're under martial law.

237
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,906
There are infected people all over this place.

238
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,306
- What's your point?
- Is it necessary to find out...

239
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,735
everything that happens in the building?

240
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,845
There might be more infected people inside.

241
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,245
What if we do?

242
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:16,676
What if we find more infected people?

243
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,316
Where are we going to lock them up?
We're under lock down too.

244
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:22,615
Yi Hyun.

245
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,556
We can get out after two days.

246
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,125
Don't stir things up in the name of investigation.
Got it?

247
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:29,495
I just want us to be safe.

248
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,456
What if people get bitten
and there are more infected people?

249
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:33,326
My wife...

250
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,865
is very sick right now.

251
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:38,796
She got tested for breast cancer.

252
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:41,235
We're suspecting a cancer recurrence.

253
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,005
We got a call from the hospital.

254
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:47,975
We thought she was cancer-free.

255
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:49,745
So we opened up a rice cake shop.

256
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:52,546
Yi Hyun.

257
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:55,245
I need to get back to my wife.

258
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:56,855
You also know...

259
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,355
how much she has gone through.

260
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:01,186
Don't you?

261
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:08,765
Jung Guk is right.

262
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,135
There isn't much...

263
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:13,865
we can do.

264
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,416
I want the whole thing.

265
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,585
Fine.

266
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,755
Let's hold out until the disease control team comes.

267
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:41,595
Let's do that.

268
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:56,816
I don't think I can.

269
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,485
Number 13 among all the materials
for the clinical trial...

270
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,656
seems to be working.

271
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:05,786
Give me the numbers.

272
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:07,786
Seventy-two percent of the severely-ill patients...

273
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:08,926
have longer cycles...

274
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,526
and fewer frequencies of their symptoms.

275
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:29,715
What's your thirst level?

276
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:31,816
I barely get thirsty.

277
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:33,345
What about my family?

278
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:34,745
They are well.

279
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:36,916
Sir, not yet...

280
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:45,826
By the way,

281
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:48,125
did you always like meat?

282
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:50,066
No.

283
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:53,436
I used to be a vegetarian.

284
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:57,406
You're recovering well.

285
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:06,715
Don't worry about your family.

286
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:08,515
Just focus on getting better.

287
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,836
They're not done analysing Yoon Sae Bom's blood, right?

288
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,295
No, not yet.

289
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,065
Keep a tight lid on that.

290
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:28,906
But leak the progress
about Number 13 to the higher-ups.

291
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,436
We're still in the early stage of our clinical trial.

292
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:33,376
We need a bit more data.

293
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,206
That's precisely why.
We need more data.

294
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:36,315
Tell them the clinical trial is over,

295
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,116
and we're about to finalize it.

296
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:40,646
What did you do in there?

297
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,346
What?

298
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,686
It's... It's nothing.

299
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,656
I was just feeling a bit suffocated.

300
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,686
I heard this apartment was empty.

301
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,055
I'll go in with you.

302
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,926
- I was feeling suffocated too.
- Wait.

303
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:07,035
I'm sorry. My brother's inside.

304
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:21,946
Mr. Na. You're inside. Aren't you?

305
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:23,755
Are you okay?

306
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:29,525
It's okay. You can talk.

307
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:31,456
They're the couple from upstairs.

308
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,626
Yes. I'm still okay.

309
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:37,965
Did you eat a packed meal at the entrance
in basement level 1?

310
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,235
Did your sister give it to you?

311
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:45,305
No. The male doctor from the sixth floor gave it to me.

312
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,406
He knew that...

313
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,446
I contracted the disease.

314
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,086
You must be hungry.

315
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:26,186
What did Oh Ju Hyung say?

316
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:29,956
He told me I should come inside the apartment,

317
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:32,386
but I refused. When I did,

318
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:35,926
he told me to think about it...

319
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,626
and gave me the packed meal.

320
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:40,225
Why did you refuse?

321
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:42,325
I'm sure you wanted to come in.

322
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,836
I was scared...

323
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:47,906
that I would end up biting people.

324
00:21:57,676 --> 00:21:59,146
Even if the lock down ends tomorrow,

325
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,785
just stay at home.

326
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:04,215
- Okay.
- You and your brother both.

327
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:07,086
We'll go out and explain the situation...

328
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,856
and bring in the doctors.

329
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:12,926
Thank you so much for understanding.

330
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:15,565
This isn't because we understand.
It's because we have no choice.

331
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:18,196
We can't even kick you out.

332
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,906
But still, I'm grateful.

333
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,575
Thank you.

334
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:26,475
My gosh.

335
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:46,025
Bo Ram.

336
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:48,126
Come here.

337
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:50,035
Just a minute.

338
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,346
- Bo Ram.
- Let me say this in advance.

339
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:07,916
I'm not going to take your money,
so don't worry.

340
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:10,015
I don't want to get involved in this.

341
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:11,686
It's not that.

342
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:15,156
Did you hear the banging sounds last night?

343
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:19,896
That's the sound the infected make.

344
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:23,396
I think it's my mom.

345
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:26,765
I saw some photos my mom took,
and she has wounds on her back.

346
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:30,676
She said she bumped into the infected woman
on the sixth floor.

347
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:32,035
So?

348
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,575
What do you mean "so"?

349
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,715
If my mom is infected, we could get infected too.

350
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:39,886
Are you afraid about that?

351
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,515
You're not worried?

352
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:45,586
If you're so scared, stay locked up in your room.

353
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:49,755
No, it's not that. I'm worried about you.

354
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,096
You're worried about me?

355
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,396
Be good to your parents.

356
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:56,366
I would want nothing more than parents like yours.

357
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:57,735
Wait...

358
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:10,015
When the lock down ends
and things settle down tomorrow,

359
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,815
I should visit my mom first.

360
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:16,916
According to First Lieutenant Lee,
they're taking good care of her.

361
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:18,785
I'm sure she's okay.

362
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,386
I had no idea I would meet my mom like this.

363
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:25,356
Oh, right.

364
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,995
Do you think things are okay in the US?

365
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,765
Thank goodness we didn't have a wedding.

366
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,606
I know. Imagine if this happened
on her way here.

367
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,465
I almost became a bad son.

368
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:44,015
Did we do a good job?

369
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:47,616
About getting married?
Of course, we did.

370
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,045
No, I'm talking about the fourth floor.

371
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:50,886
Oh, Mr. Na?

372
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,255
He seemed okay.

373
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:57,295
- Is it because it's too early?
- Lieutenant Colonel Han said...

374
00:24:57,356 --> 00:24:59,126
you could control your thirst.

375
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:00,565
As long as you're determined.

376
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,366
Then I will never get infected.

377
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:04,765
You know how tough of a man I am.

378
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:07,406
I'm excited to see it.

379
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:13,305
What is this?

380
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:14,876
Is it edible?

381
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,305
For indigestion.

382
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:19,215
When I played baseball,
I got stomachaches when I got nervous.

383
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,285
That's why I got it
when I went to play in the Italian Championships,

384
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:22,946
but it tastes disgusting,
so don't eat it.

385
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:24,215
I see.

386
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:28,356
I've never taken digestive medicine in my life.

387
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:30,126
I'm jealous.

388
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,896
You know,

389
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,535
I can eat everything here.

390
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:42,866
- That's a lot, isn't it?
- Right.

391
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,436
It's because we have the food
from Seo Yoon's place too.

392
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,475
Even still, we shared it with everyone else.

393
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:50,745
When the lock down ends tomorrow,

394
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:52,616
let's put everything back.

395
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:56,586
What if the lock down doesn't end tomorrow?

396
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,055
We could wait while we eat that.

397
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:02,956
You said you were a tough guy.

398
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:11,196
Thanks a lot.

399
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:41,495
(Mom)

400
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,295
(No service.
Mobile network is unavailable in your region.)

401
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:06,686
Mr. Kim.

402
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,785
Do you want to go outside
or stay here with Seo Yoon?

403
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:12,295
Well...

404
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:17,136
Someone should stay here with Seo Yoon.
Don't you think?

405
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:19,666
Right. Then give me the gun.

406
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,475
Hey, Sae Bom.

407
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,775
I'm having a hard time these days.

408
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:33,745
Okay. Hold onto it.

409
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:36,315
I was just wondering. That's why I asked.

410
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:40,586
Sae Bom, my phone isn't working yet.

411
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,255
Do you think everything is okay?

412
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:45,495
Of course. Stay here with Mr. Kim.

413
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:47,495
I'm going to go outside
and check out the situation.

414
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:51,336
If you think you might get hurt,
make sure you run away.

415
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:53,965
Don't worry.
I'm really good at sensing those things.

416
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:03,676
Hello.

417
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,416
What?

418
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:07,785
What is this?

419
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:09,315
It was here when I came in.

420
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:11,785
(You've been through so much.)

421
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:15,725
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

422
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:18,255
I didn't realize there was such a nice person
in Seyang Forest.

423
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,396
I guess they have a lot of water at home.

424
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,896
I think it's the girl from the fourth floor.

425
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:24,795
She's very generous.

426
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,465
Did you enjoy living on the third floor?

427
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,106
Even after you almost killed us all?

428
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:32,975
I'm sorry.

429
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,416
Goodness.

430
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,856
What is this? It's like an oasis in the desert.
No way.

431
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:47,686
Did you prepare this, Ms. Oh?

432
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,596
You guys have all been through so much.

433
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,065
Can we drink more than one?

434
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:02,636
What? Yes, of course. Go ahead.

435
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,376
Here.

436
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:17,156
Here. Take it. We're neighbours.

437
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,186
When will the doors open?

438
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:26,196
Let's go out and check?

439
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:27,926
Who wants to go out with me?

440
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:38,975
Let's go.

441
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,215
We need to go outside to find out.

442
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:54,156
Don't drink it.

443
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:57,126
Who knows if someone spiked it?

444
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:58,626
No way.

445
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:00,995
Hey.

446
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:05,096
Honestly...

447
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:20,245
Are we here too early?

448
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:53,406
This is not a drill.

449
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,946
Everyone. This is not a drill.

450
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:00,515
The martial law that was to be lifted today...

451
00:32:00,846 --> 00:32:03,086
will be extended indefinitely.

452
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:05,686
I repeat.

453
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:08,725
The martial law that was to be lifted today...

454
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:11,356
- will be extended indefinitely.
- Oh, dear Lord.

455
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:13,495
- Why?
- Oh, no.

456
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:15,225
This is not a drill.

457
00:32:15,426 --> 00:32:16,495
What now?

458
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:17,866
I repeat.

459
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:21,866
Everyone. This is not a drill.

460
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:25,376
The martial law that was to be lifted today...

461
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:27,876
will be extended indefinitely.

462
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,275
I repeat.

463
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:37,916
This is not a drill.

464
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,485
Everyone. This is not a drill.

465
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:52,673
Ms. Woo said...

466
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:54,673
she needed some legal advice.

467
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:57,373
Where is she now?

468
00:32:57,974 --> 00:33:00,014
She was right here.
Where did she go?

469
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:02,643
There she is.

470
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:05,453
You're back.

471
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:09,153
I lost a lot of money being locked up here.

472
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:10,653
I want to calculate how much.

473
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,734
Did you hear the broadcast?

474
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,703
Yes. We both were really surprised.
Weren't we?

475
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:21,264
We were.

476
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,474
Are you done here?

477
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,044
Yes, I am.

478
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:29,673
Then go.

479
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,474
Okay.

480
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:36,754
If you need anything else, like legal...

481
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,653
- Sure. Goodbye.
- Bye.

482
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,494
Don't drink that.

483
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:49,423
You left it in the gym to try to appease everyone.

484
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,234
We're no longer able to leave.

485
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:02,274
Did you have fun?

486
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:06,544
- With what?
- The lawyer.

487
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,344
The legal stuff.

488
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:12,353
It was so-so.

489
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:33,243
Where were you? You said you'd stay at home.

490
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:35,243
I was with our neighbour.

491
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:39,073
I gave Sang Hee some legal advice
because we thought we could get out.

492
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,344
But the martial law got extended.

493
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:45,654
I wasted my time for no pay.

494
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:54,094
What are we going to do?

495
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,263
What do we do?

496
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:56,864
Hey.

497
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:59,033
Let's try getting out of here.

498
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,134
We can't stay here forever.

499
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:04,603
The martial law got extended.
If you leave,

500
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:06,504
you could get shot on the spot.

501
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:10,044
The thumping sound from inside the building.

502
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:13,884
It could've come from outside
or from the basement.

503
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:15,243
My mom.

504
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:18,553
I think she's sick.

505
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,484
She had a wound on her back.

506
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,424
I saw...

507
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,424
a photo she'd taken with her phone.

508
00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:27,223
Are you telling the truth?

509
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,163
Dad.

510
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,663
You know Mom's weird, don't you?

511
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,803
It's psoriasis!

512
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:39,274
Your skin dries out when you get older,

513
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:41,674
and sometimes you scratch until you bleed.

514
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:45,314
I've been putting on her back...

515
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,183
What is that called?

516
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:49,853
You know, that thing that you put on like this.

517
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:51,314
A moisturiser?

518
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,223
Yes, that. A moisturiser.

519
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:56,553
I helped her put on moisturiser.

520
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:57,754
I saw it too.

521
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,393
It's just cracked dry skin.

522
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:02,064
We shall go and check.

523
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:03,893
Let's hear them out first.

524
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:06,964
Who says you can come into my home?

525
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:09,873
Do what you want outside.

526
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:11,433
My wife and I...

527
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,743
will not leave our house anymore.

528
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:15,774
Darn you.

529
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:26,183
We must discuss rations.

530
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:28,524
The food and necessities on the second floor.

531
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,353
We should distribute that.

532
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:31,723
What are you on about?

533
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:33,263
What are we to eat, then?

534
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:34,594
Should we starve?

535
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,864
Let's be honest.

536
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,134
It doesn't belong to you either.

537
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,763
You just brought it over.

538
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:44,004
Lady! How can you say that?

539
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:45,473
Listen, lady.

540
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,603
We risked our lives to get all that.

541
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:49,143
Who says we should share?

542
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:51,814
You're staying here for free.

543
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:53,844
- What are you so upset about?
- What?

544
00:36:54,783 --> 00:36:57,353
You spoke nonsense about the 11th floor
being a Royal Floor.

545
00:36:57,513 --> 00:36:59,353
Why don't you charge us to breathe too?

546
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:00,453
Shall we pay you for oxygen?

547
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:03,353
This is how I get betrayed for being considerate.

548
00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:05,553
- "Considerate"?
- Now, now.

549
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,094
Calm down, everyone.

550
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:10,393
You can leave if you want, lady!

551
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,864
- Calm down.
- We risked our lives!

552
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,004
The resident representative.

553
00:37:14,103 --> 00:37:15,404
We got it for ourselves!

554
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:16,873
- This won't do.
- We got it all!

555
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,634
She'll only start more fights.

556
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,103
- How could you?
- Please calm down.

557
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,214
Bo Ram.

558
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:36,283
You can't stay here anymore.

559
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:37,953
Go somewhere else.

560
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:40,893
I have nowhere to go.

561
00:37:40,964 --> 00:37:44,033
Go to Unit 501. They're good people.

562
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:48,163
They'll find you a place to stay.

563
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:49,904
Bye.

564
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,274
Hey.

565
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:01,044
Why did they gather everyone?

566
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:04,783
For the same usual nonsense.

567
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:05,913
You...

568
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,223
Set the table. I'm hungry.

569
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:14,594
- Where's Dong Hyun?
- He's...

570
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,263
He'll be somewhere in the building.

571
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:19,864
By the way,

572
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:22,433
the supermarket part-timer.

573
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:25,274
She found an empty apartment to stay in.

574
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:28,073
Good for her.

575
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:39,953
I thought...

576
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:41,984
we'd be able to use the elevator from today.

577
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:46,823
I can't stand that cleaning crew.

578
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,524
They are so rude too.

579
00:38:48,864 --> 00:38:50,694
But we can't kick them out.

580
00:38:57,873 --> 00:38:58,873
Wait!

581
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:02,004
Gosh. My arm!

582
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:03,774
My arm is stuck.

583
00:39:04,913 --> 00:39:05,944
Gosh.

584
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:06,944
What's going on?

585
00:39:09,044 --> 00:39:10,254
We need to talk.

586
00:39:12,913 --> 00:39:14,183
Let's talk outside.

587
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:15,424
Thanks for inviting us in.

588
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:18,524
Hey!

589
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:20,194
What?

590
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:23,564
Gosh. We're already inside.

591
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:25,364
Let's talk comfortably inside.

592
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,464
Go inside.

593
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:34,303
We haven't completely settled in yet.

594
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,573
Are you guys really here to live?

595
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:42,913
We ordered our furniture and home appliances in sets.

596
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,254
But they haven't arrived yet.

597
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:47,053
The fridge and microwave look very modest.

598
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:50,154
We need to live here for now.

599
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:51,524
Or maybe, you never meant...

600
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,064
to live here.

601
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:56,493
Isn't this yours?

602
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:57,964
(Muil Group Constructions)

603
00:39:58,834 --> 00:39:59,834
No.

604
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:01,433
Oh, right here.

605
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:03,533
It says, "In Celebration of Muil Group Constructions..."

606
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:05,573
"as the Selected Builder."

607
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:08,303
This was given out when they announced...

608
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,544
the selection of the builder.

609
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:11,614
All the residents who got a unit...

610
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:14,044
in this apartment received one.

611
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,814
Residents from general sales.

612
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:20,013
Not the residents from free rental units.

613
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,154
I know that you gave water to Kim Seung Beom.

614
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:26,154
Who told you that?

615
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,723
Your job is to become the apartment representative...

616
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:29,924
and embezzle the public funds, isn't it?

617
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:33,234
Kim Seung Beom got a job here
to help you, didn't he?

618
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:38,703
Do you have proof?

619
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:44,013
Let's go.

620
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:45,973
Ma'am.

621
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:48,283
I'll promise you one thing.

622
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:50,283
It's about the apartment representative.

623
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,283
You will never become one.

624
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,223
That was some nice advanced interrogative method.

625
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,594
It was pretty good today.

626
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:06,234
Did you see that?
You need to ask them point-blank.

627
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,933
Otherwise, they'll keep playing innocent.

628
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:09,004
Right.

629
00:41:10,274 --> 00:41:11,274
Jung Guk.

630
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:13,004
Are you here to pray too?

631
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,274
I'm an atheist.

632
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:15,344
I see.

633
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:18,373
What about Seo Yoon?

634
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:20,743
I asked Bo Ram to come upstairs and stay with her...

635
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,484
for a bit.

636
00:41:22,544 --> 00:41:23,853
She said she left Unit 302,

637
00:41:23,913 --> 00:41:25,553
so she didn't have a place to sleep.

638
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:27,084
- Then Seo Yoon...
- Make it quick then.

639
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,584
Okay. I'll be home soon.

640
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,353
- Okay.
- But...

641
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:31,623
We'll see you downstairs.

642
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:35,524
What do we do with Bo Ram?

643
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:37,893
Should we ask her
to stay in Unit 502 for a while?

644
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,493
Let's ask Seo Yoon first.

645
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:42,803
It's obvious they are con artists.
I'm worried about him.

646
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:44,933
He needs someone to rely on too.

647
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:46,844
When I couldn't play baseball anymore,
I was in the same place.

648
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,344
Did you pray too?

649
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:50,004
No. I had something else.

650
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:56,384
You have bottled beverages, right?

651
00:41:56,444 --> 00:41:58,114
I don't want high-calorie drinks.

652
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,453
Here. Give me 50 dollars' worth of beverages.

653
00:42:02,884 --> 00:42:04,694
You still haven't come to your senses.

654
00:42:05,694 --> 00:42:07,823
I could just beat you. Beat it.

655
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:10,433
Hey. What...

656
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:14,203
One hundred dollars.

657
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:16,303
You're still not going to sell?

658
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:20,274
It's 200 dollars for one 500ml bottled drink.

659
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:25,314
Are you trying to make a fortune
by selling this stuff...

660
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:27,283
at an apartment you don't even live in?

661
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,344
What?

662
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:30,413
Am I not allowed to make a fortune?

663
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,384
I'll make a fortune and live here too.

664
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,654
You called me a guard dog.

665
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:39,453
Bring me money. You don't want to?

666
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,024
Woof!

667
00:42:44,634 --> 00:42:48,634
Fine. I'll go bring more money. Darn it.

668
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:56,303
That jerk.
Did you see him getting scared and running away?

669
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:01,614
What?

670
00:43:02,214 --> 00:43:03,444
Did I do something wrong?

671
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:05,913
That jerk looked down on me first.

672
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:06,984
No.

673
00:43:07,524 --> 00:43:09,553
Since people don't carry a lot of cash these days,

674
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:11,723
we'll accept valuables too.

675
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:13,024
Gosh. Yes.

676
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:15,623
The resident representative might
have a lot of jewellery, right?

677
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:18,393
I'm going to take her jewellery.

678
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:20,533
Given what happened,

679
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:22,234
we ought to make as much money as we can.

680
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,803
We need to pay for Seung Hoon's college too.

681
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:27,944
One, two, three...

682
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:32,013
Ma'am. Hey.

683
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,544
Stop listening to Ms. Oh
and cleaning the apartment.

684
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:37,513
Clean this house. Okay?

685
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:39,283
We're letting you eat
that expensive bread and water.

686
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:40,783
So be grateful.

687
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:51,964
"He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still."

688
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,504
"He who is filthy, let him be filthy still."

689
00:43:56,464 --> 00:44:00,544
"He who is righteous,
let him do righteousness still."

690
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:03,504
"He who is holy..."

691
00:44:03,573 --> 00:44:05,714
My arm is stuck.

692
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:09,484
"let him be holy still."

693
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:10,853
Amen.

694
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:12,913
Amen.

695
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,123
- Amen.
- Amen.

696
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:19,924
I have a question about Ms. Yoon Sae Bom.

697
00:44:20,564 --> 00:44:22,294
Is she all right?

698
00:44:22,364 --> 00:44:25,433
- Pardon?
- I saw a scratch on her hand.

699
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:28,564
I was worried that she was infected.

700
00:44:29,163 --> 00:44:31,603
And it looked like she had something going on...

701
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:33,473
with the military guy that came before.

702
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:36,504
I'm right, aren't I?

703
00:44:47,553 --> 00:44:48,553
Hey.

704
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:54,623
We have flash grenades.

705
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:57,834
That's a lot.

706
00:44:58,433 --> 00:44:59,834
And we have handcuffs too.

707
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:06,834
And...

708
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,774
What's that? A walkie-talkie?

709
00:45:11,314 --> 00:45:13,344
He said he couldn't give me a gun,
so he gave me that instead.

710
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,444
How do we use this? Hey, turn this on.

711
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:18,413
Let's find out what's going on outside.

712
00:45:22,254 --> 00:45:23,993
Hey, you. Have some snacks.

713
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:25,823
Okay.

714
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:32,694
Later. If he sees this,
he'll feel anxious again.

715
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,373
How did your prayer go?

716
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:39,473
What? It was good.

717
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:49,814
Are you worried that you can't go out?

718
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,953
No. It's not that.

719
00:45:53,214 --> 00:45:56,584
You went outside with Han Tae Seok the other day.

720
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,353
There was blood all over your body.

721
00:45:58,424 --> 00:46:00,323
Are you all right?

722
00:46:00,393 --> 00:46:02,364
Are you hurt?

723
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:03,763
I'm fine.

724
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:06,334
That...

725
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:08,533
When did you get that?

726
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:12,373
Oh, this? A long time ago, my friend...

727
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:14,944
scratched me.

728
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:17,274
I see. When you were at the dorm?

729
00:46:18,044 --> 00:46:20,743
Then that was a pretty long time ago.

730
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:22,913
It's not healing quickly.

731
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,553
Jung Guk, don't worry.

732
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:30,493
If something feels wrong with me,

733
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:31,924
I'll tell you.

734
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:34,123
Do you think I'll bite you or Yi Hyun?

735
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:38,594
Right.

736
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:44,004
- One, two, three,
- One, two, three,

737
00:46:44,004 --> 00:46:46,203
- four, five, six, seven.
- four, five, six, seven.

738
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:50,444
- What's this?
- It's...

739
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:35,853
What?

740
00:47:36,223 --> 00:47:37,254
Why are you up at this hour?

741
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:38,353
Sir.

742
00:47:38,893 --> 00:47:41,623
Can you please let me live here?
My mother is infected.

743
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:44,134
How can I trust you?

744
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:46,234
Go somewhere else.

745
00:47:46,893 --> 00:47:48,703
I'm really not infected. Please?

746
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:50,404
I was out all day.

747
00:47:50,573 --> 00:47:52,033
And look at this.

748
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:55,573
I'm completely fine.

749
00:47:55,643 --> 00:47:57,814
I'll stay here, clean, and do all the chores.

750
00:47:57,873 --> 00:47:59,344
And I brought...

751
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,413
all the food from my house.

752
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,913
I know that you're both nice people.

753
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:05,783
Please. I know you have big hearts.

754
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:07,783
Please help me.

755
00:48:10,694 --> 00:48:12,294
- Wait.
- Okay.

756
00:48:14,263 --> 00:48:16,663
The more food we have, the better it is.

757
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:19,433
We don't know how much longer we have to stay here.

758
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:22,263
Where is he going to sleep?
We don't have a spare room.

759
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,473
What if he bites us in the middle of the night?

760
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,373
- Gosh.
- I'll leave.

761
00:48:29,203 --> 00:48:30,504
To go where?

762
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:35,044
I'll go to the fourth floor for now.

763
00:48:35,614 --> 00:48:38,154
If not, I'll go to other units.

764
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:39,353
But...

765
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,924
give me some food.

766
00:49:07,073 --> 00:49:08,283
Excuse me, ma'am.

767
00:49:11,754 --> 00:49:12,984
Will you be okay?

768
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,223
The other places might not let you stay with them.

769
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:19,623
If they won't,
I'll go stay in the basement lounge.

770
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:22,663
I think I'll feel better being there alone.

771
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:25,734
Be careful.

772
00:49:26,294 --> 00:49:28,103
People are getting meaner.

773
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,384
Thank you.

774
00:49:58,163 --> 00:49:59,364
What do you want now?

775
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:01,603
I found something.

776
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:03,004
Something...

777
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,573
you'd really love to know.

778
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:12,444
What did you find here?

779
00:50:13,373 --> 00:50:15,683
Something you need right now.

780
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:16,844
What's the passcode?

781
00:50:18,614 --> 00:50:20,114
It's 8888.

782
00:50:26,353 --> 00:50:30,163
Things are going smoothly
since you're cooperating.

783
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:31,464
What's inside?

784
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,533
You don't even know the passcode,
but you know that?

785
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,303
I saw someone bring something in here secretly.

786
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:38,933
The people on the second floor?

787
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:42,444
Did they hide food in here?

788
00:50:42,504 --> 00:50:43,803
You'll be surprised when you see it.

789
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,743
Did you eat something?

790
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:07,864
Who's inside?

791
00:51:08,904 --> 00:51:10,973
I told you nobody could live in here!

792
00:51:18,314 --> 00:51:19,513
Who are you?

793
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:21,114
Look at me.

794
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:34,878
Can anyone hear me?

795
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:36,878
First Lieutenant Lee.

796
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:41,549
Hey, Han Tae Seok!

797
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:44,518
I'm sure they didn't give up on us.

798
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:46,989
They must need time to get things settled.

799
00:51:50,288 --> 00:51:51,858
Right. The battery might die.

800
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:53,159
Let's try again later.

801
00:51:58,498 --> 00:52:00,029
- Hey.
- Yes?

802
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:01,498
Since we're up here,

803
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:03,569
can you tell me about when you played baseball?

804
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:06,069
When I won?

805
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,708
I went out as the relief player
in the third innings...

806
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:09,978
Not that. About you.

807
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,909
If you didn't rely on religion,
what did you rely on?

808
00:52:13,779 --> 00:52:15,049
You said that everyone...

809
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,849
needed something to rely on.

810
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:26,659
You.

811
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:30,529
- What?
- To be honest,

812
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:33,799
I was really miserable.

813
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,239
I acted fine in front of you,

814
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:38,308
but who was I without baseball?

815
00:52:39,339 --> 00:52:40,608
I wasn't anything.

816
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:42,878
But after hearing what you said...

817
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:44,849
and falling down,

818
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,878
I thought to myself,
"Is this how I'm going to die?"

819
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:53,018
Then I had a moment of clarity.

820
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:57,589
I thought, "Everything is futile."

821
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:00,728
Thanks to you, I felt better.

822
00:53:03,529 --> 00:53:04,699
Gosh, you're embarrassing me.

823
00:53:05,569 --> 00:53:07,099
Why would you say that to my face?

824
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:09,998
You should've thanked me in secret.

825
00:53:12,308 --> 00:53:13,509
I was always grateful.

826
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:44,639
Why are you two together?

827
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:46,768
- What is it?
- None of your business.

828
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:48,679
Na Soo Min...

829
00:53:49,578 --> 00:53:51,849
was infected and hiding in the apartment.

830
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:54,179
Did you really hide him there?

831
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,119
Can I come inside for a second?

832
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:10,929
Mr. Na?

833
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:13,268
Do you hear us?

834
00:54:16,538 --> 00:54:18,239
I don't hear anything,

835
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:19,839
so it doesn't seem to have developed.

836
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:54,978
Mr. Na.

837
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:56,878
Are you okay?

838
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:06,619
Please save me.

839
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:08,589
I swear.

840
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:12,228
I swear I didn't bite anyone.

841
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:14,858
I just stared at that resident representative.

842
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:16,799
I swear.

843
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:21,498
I have to see my children.

844
00:55:25,768 --> 00:55:27,878
We have to quarantine the infected. Right?

845
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:35,549
Just bear with it a little.

846
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:37,418
We'll figure out the situation and come back.

847
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:38,719
Can you protect Hyun Kyung,

848
00:55:39,389 --> 00:55:43,058
so she doesn't end up like me?

849
00:55:43,418 --> 00:55:44,858
I wasn't the one...

850
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:46,089
who was banging around.

851
00:55:58,768 --> 00:56:00,339
It's not too late.

852
00:56:06,748 --> 00:56:08,819
You guys could get cornered
for having been infected...

853
00:56:08,878 --> 00:56:10,518
since you've been in contact with them.

854
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,089
I even heard you had contact
with the first infected person.

855
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:16,089
We should begin trusting each other...

856
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:18,889
And support you so that you can
become the apartment representative?

857
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:24,268
Is this the time and place for that?

858
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,898
When would I bring it up otherwise?

859
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:30,339
There's no right time to make money.

860
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:39,179
You know that Oh Ju Hyung is crazy. Right?

861
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:43,378
You guys are so soft.

862
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:46,018
How will you go up against Oh Ju Hyung?

863
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:56,458
Is Oh Ju Hyung at home?

864
00:56:57,768 --> 00:56:58,969
Please step outside for a minute.

865
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,498
You won't see anything nice.

866
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:08,938
I heard...

867
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,478
you're the one who found Na Soo Min.

868
00:57:10,538 --> 00:57:13,608
Yes. I put in the effort
for the safety of the apartment.

869
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:18,688
Goodness.

870
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:22,358
You should each...

871
00:57:23,018 --> 00:57:24,188
have a drink.

872
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:27,358
I heard the infected got thirstier
when they drink water.

873
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:29,259
You guys were with Na Soo Min the whole time.

874
00:57:29,328 --> 00:57:31,069
I'm just worried about you.

875
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,768
You're going to look for an infected person among us?

876
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:38,869
Then...

877
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,538
you should drink up too.

878
00:57:45,449 --> 00:57:46,449
Okay.

879
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:34,628
Good.

880
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:38,128
We three are healthy.

881
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:40,268
You must take action.

882
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,699
That is the only way...

883
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:44,509
to prevent a mishap.

884
00:58:44,569 --> 00:58:47,409
You want to see your family again in good health.

885
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:48,538
To do that,

886
00:58:49,478 --> 00:58:52,909
you must do things you don't want to.

887
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:57,018
Why avoid the situation
when there's something you can do?

888
00:58:59,389 --> 00:59:00,389
What...

889
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,089
What can I do?

890
00:59:05,328 --> 00:59:08,099
Lock up the infected
who are pretending to be human.

891
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,299
And restore order.

892
00:59:40,628 --> 00:59:42,128
I think he's puking.

893
00:59:42,998 --> 00:59:44,369
Shouldn't we too?

894
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,869
It did taste a little bitter.

895
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,438
I've never vomited before.
How do you do it?

896
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:53,308
Let's wait a bit.

897
00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:54,378
Hey.

898
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,748
My wife got sick because of some pills, right?

899
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:14,089
These are the pills her trainer sold her.

900
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,199
Did you put this in the drinks?

901
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:21,299
Did you leave the drinks in the gym?

902
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:23,569
To get everyone here sick.

903
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:26,139
If everyone dies or gets infected,

904
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:28,639
you won't be charged with murder.

905
01:00:29,078 --> 01:00:31,478
How do you even get such crazy ideas?

906
01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:32,949
No.

907
01:00:33,878 --> 01:00:35,279
I just need you two dead.

908
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:37,418
The rest are a bonus.

909
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:41,159
The more infected there are,
the sooner we'll find a cure.

910
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:42,889
This is unbelievable.

911
01:00:43,259 --> 01:00:45,389
You're confessing, aren't you?

912
01:00:45,489 --> 01:00:46,529
Basically,

913
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:50,199
you have to go home and not come back out.

914
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:52,429
If you die of mad person disease,

915
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:54,369
that's just your loss.

916
01:00:54,699 --> 01:00:56,569
Until a cure is found,

917
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:58,208
lie low,

918
01:00:58,268 --> 01:01:00,668
and hide in your apartment.

919
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:03,679
You killed your wife, didn't you?

920
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:06,779
No. I didn't kill anyone.

921
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:10,578
Unless you want to kill someone,

922
01:01:10,648 --> 01:01:13,648
go home, stay there,
and keep your mouths shut.

923
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:15,858
If you won't do that, go outside...

924
01:01:15,918 --> 01:01:18,989
and ask that Lieutenant Colonel for help.

925
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:20,589
I'm so sorry.

926
01:01:24,529 --> 01:01:25,569
This.

927
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:29,839
What are you doing?

928
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:32,869
What's wrong with you?

929
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:38,409
Hey. Why would you do that? Spit it out.

930
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:40,949
It's bitter.

931
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:44,248
It's the digestive medicine I took
when I played baseball.

932
01:01:46,418 --> 01:01:47,418
What is this?

933
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:48,958
Is it edible?

934
01:01:49,219 --> 01:01:50,918
For indigestion. When I played baseball,

935
01:01:50,989 --> 01:01:52,529
I got stomachaches when I got nervous.

936
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:54,759
You bothered me so much,

937
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:56,858
I swapped out the pills.

938
01:02:31,268 --> 01:02:32,429
Darn you.

939
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:36,969
The dashcam...

940
01:02:37,038 --> 01:02:39,168
caught you taking the pills.

941
01:02:39,438 --> 01:02:40,469
Mr. Oh.

942
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:43,639
This time, there's no getting out.

943
01:02:45,248 --> 01:02:47,208
What'll you do to me, then?

944
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:48,748
What else?

945
01:02:50,018 --> 01:02:51,549
Murderers must be isolated too.

946
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:04,099
Sae Bom.

947
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:07,328
I'm really sorry.

948
01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:10,739
I can't get sick.

949
01:03:12,009 --> 01:03:13,069
Jung Guk.

950
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,739
Oh Ju Hyung killed someone.

951
01:03:19,478 --> 01:03:21,009
That's none of our business.

952
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:23,478
Right now, whether you're infected or not
is more important.

953
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,819
You two were exposed to the infected.

954
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:28,089
Yoon Sae Bom, you were scratched
by an infected person.

955
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:31,288
I think you should be isolated.

956
01:03:47,069 --> 01:03:49,478
This precious cure will heal us fast.

957
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:51,378
- Yes.
- We should get better soon.

958
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:53,208
I feel better already.

959
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:55,078
- Me too.
- It's a great feeling.

960
01:03:55,148 --> 01:03:56,148
It is.

961
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:58,119
We'll be cured soon.

962
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:06,659
More people were infected than I thought.

963
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:10,299
Did you all take Next?

964
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:13,469
That shot definitely makes me feel better.

965
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:14,869
Good job.

966
01:04:15,668 --> 01:04:17,438
Your wife should get the shot too.

967
01:04:17,498 --> 01:04:18,538
She should.

968
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:22,038
I heard that Component 13 was hard to manufacture.

969
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,679
It is. We can't produce much of it.

970
01:04:25,878 --> 01:04:29,248
I think it'll be best
if martial law stays in place for now.

971
01:04:29,518 --> 01:04:30,849
Keep everyone on lock down...

972
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:33,788
to keep the infected numbers low
before releasing the cure.

973
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:36,259
The infected don't even know
if they killed people.

974
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:39,029
If we let them live,
they'll become a problem.

975
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:40,728
You are very right.

976
01:04:41,498 --> 01:04:43,958
Whether the situation is resolved or not,

977
01:04:44,328 --> 01:04:46,599
problematic people are best taken care of soon.

978
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:50,038
People like you.

979
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:53,639
What are you saying?

980
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,739
We'd just begun the clinical trials on the cure,

981
01:04:56,078 --> 01:04:58,608
but you used money and power to take it.

982
01:04:59,248 --> 01:05:01,179
You should pay for that.

983
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,849
What do you think you can do?

984
01:05:47,828 --> 01:05:51,398
Thanks to you,
we will have more data to work with.

985
01:06:07,078 --> 01:06:08,819
Have a good time.

986
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:13,319
Make room!

987
01:06:18,128 --> 01:06:19,929
Mine!

988
01:06:38,509 --> 01:06:42,648
(Wonjung University Student Dormitories)

989
01:06:44,018 --> 01:06:47,288
Sir, there was an incident
in the chairman suite.

990
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:50,159
High-up politicians were all infected.

991
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,788
Component 13.

992
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:54,029
They stole it and got injected with it.

993
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:58,529
That failed the second round of clinical trials.

994
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,128
We're throwing out all the samples.

995
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:02,569
I guess they didn't know.

996
01:07:04,668 --> 01:07:05,868
They're important people.

997
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,568
Have them brought in alive.

998
01:07:08,068 --> 01:07:10,078
We need them as test subjects.

999
01:07:38,238 --> 01:07:39,238
Honey.

1000
01:07:44,378 --> 01:07:45,748
I'm thirsty.

1001
01:07:46,908 --> 01:07:47,979
Young In.

1002
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:53,049
We're almost there.

1003
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:11,668
=Happiness=

1004
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:31,089
I'm running out of patience now.

1005
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:33,929
Are you thirsty too?

1006
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:35,698
They are good at concealing their thirst.

1007
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,599
They don't look much different
from regular people.

1008
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:39,399
Be careful. You cannot...

1009
01:08:40,599 --> 01:08:42,068
trust those people.

1010
01:08:42,538 --> 01:08:44,698
Should we look for infected people?

1011
01:08:45,139 --> 01:08:47,038
Just say that you also think...

1012
01:08:47,038 --> 01:08:48,908
the woman on the fifth floor is infected too.

1013
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:52,248
If things get dangerous,
I'll take the medicine too.

1014
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:54,208
There will be casualties.

1015
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:56,078
I can only make one decision.

1016
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:57,918
You're responsible for the death.
