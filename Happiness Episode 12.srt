No, it's just a mild cold.

But I don't want you to catch it.

- So you're getting the surgery.
- Yes.

You can't get sick before the surgery. Okay?

50
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,276
Get the surgery like a big girl.

51

59
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,646
They told me that...

60
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,956
Seo Yoon could get the surgery thanks to you.

61
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,086
And you gave them Seo Yoon's letter. Right?

62
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:07,226
I was able to get this far
thanks to that letter.

there are two.

was infected.

to develop a cure for it.

81

Stay strong for the surgery.

82

I'll go visit you in the hospital
with Yi Hyun. I promise.

84
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:55,867
My mom is just sick too.

85

86

Of course.

87
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:04,017
That's why...

88
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:05,447
she will get better.

89
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,216
And so will you.

It's about Seo Yoon's mother.

91

She held out this long
just to see her daughter.

92
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:30,836
She won't be able to hold out anymore.

93
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:34,606
She will be moved...

94
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,846
to a freezer warehouse in a couple of days.

95

We made this with the sample of your blood.

96
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:10,346
Your antibody count is falling.

97
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,687
So what?

98
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,987
So this is the last effective shot of the disease.

99
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,786
We must amplify this to use it
for research purposes,

100
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:21,257
so we can develop a cure.

101
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:29,997
So give this up...

102
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,137
for the sake of everyone's safety.

103
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:44,646

104
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,747
They are planning to take you...

105
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:49,617

you're breaking your promise?

108
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:42,906
What are you doing?

109
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,607
Stop him.

110

It won't take long.

113
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:29,387
I'm done.

115
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,767
Where's the leftover cure?

116
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:43,597
She just left.

117
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:44,967
Didn't you see her?

118
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:00,445
Go through the back gate on the first floor.

119
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:02,046
You'll see your car there.

120
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:04,517
I left a present for you in the car.
Make sure to take it.

121
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:08,556
Can you do this, though?

122
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:10,257
I thought...

123
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:13,026
you were ambitious.

124
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,296
I have a plan. Don't worry.

125
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,426
Just do what you need to do.

126
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:18,666
If you get caught,

127
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,806
I won't bail you out.

128
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:31,936
Don't worry.

129
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:34,446
You'll get better.

130
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:44,757
What are you doing right now?

131
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:47,857
That's the cure, right?

132
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:50,026
Yes.

133
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:52,026
I was just going to leave.

134
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:53,656
But I couldn't.

135
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,837
Are you going to shoot me?

136
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:07,877
What are you going to do now?

137
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:10,176
Even if you get out of here,

138
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:12,676
you used up the cure.

139
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:18,387
I'm not that special.

140
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:20,257
There will be other people...

141
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:22,857
with the antibodies.

142
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:25,857
Yi Hyun has me,

143
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:26,957
but Seo Yoon...

144
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:29,666
doesn't have anyone.

145
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,237
Until then,

146
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,936
I just need to stay by Yi Hyun's side.

you and I had a connection.

00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,707
Yoon Sae Bom got out.

172
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,877
You know this won't end with
just you getting fired. Right?

173
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:36,347
Why? Are you going to sentence me
to the death penalty?

174
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:40,416
I thought you were smart.

175
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,127
Why did you do it?

176
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,556
If you only gave one of the cures
to your wife,

177
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:48,367
I could've let this go.

178
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:55,207
I did all sorts of things
to lower the number of the infected.

179
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:59,977
Lockdowns, quarantines, killing.

180
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,316
I have enough blood on my hands.

181
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:08,617
Thanks to that, you succeeded.

182
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,387
You protected a lot of people.

183
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:14,186
I only saw people
as a measure of efficiency and numbers.

184
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,926
But after seeing Yoon Sae Bom,

185
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,826
I realized there was another way.

186
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:08,747
Yi Hyun.

187
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,886
When you were next to me,

188
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:24,356
I didn't realize how special you were to me.

189
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,397
I will find you wherever you are.

190
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:38,636
Salute.

191
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,276
I heard Yoon Sae Bom left
with your uniform on.

192
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:44,076
Yes, sir.

193
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,576
- She forcibly...
- Forget it!

194
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:49,447
Where do you think she went?

195
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,217
It seems like she's planning to...

196
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,517
run away abroad with the cure.

197
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,987
I think we should put out an APB
for the airports in Korea.

198
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:01,126
She went to the apartment
because her husband is there.

199
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:02,397
Sir.

200
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:05,437
Keep going.

201
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,967
There's someone with the antibodies
in the apartment.

202
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,376
Give me full authority.

203
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,517
Then I will bring you the cure.

204
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,517
Will it be okay to leave?

205
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:26,487
It's okay. Even the news said
everything was okay outside.

206
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,957
Everyone but the detective left from Unit 501.

207
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:30,997
Even still. If we leave too...

208
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,197
It's better if we're not here.

209
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:34,497
We'll be helping by leaving.

210
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,326
What?

211
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,836
- Who is it?
- Hold on.

212
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:41,007
- Hold on?
- Who is that?

213
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:47,707
Hey! It's Unit 501!
You're the wife in Unit 501!

214
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:50,876
- Hey! Unlock that!
- Okay.

215
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:55,687
Are you okay?

216
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,917
- Did you get hurt?
- Did they tell you to come back in?

217
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,917
Hold on, you guys.

218
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,126
Where's Yi Hyun?
Is he okay?

219
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:06,657
Well...

220
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,267
Is he alive?

221
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,036
(One day ago)

222
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:11,157
Oh, gosh.

223
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:20,227
Yi Hyun.

224
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:22,467
Wake up.

225
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:26,366
We have to meet again.

226
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:37,207
Sae Bom.

227
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,286
Are you okay, Mister?

228
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:45,356
You're bleeding a lot.

229
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:48,386
I'm okay.

230
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:50,826
I'm going to get some sleep.

231
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:53,927
Okay.

232
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,217
Are you sure?

233
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:17,187
You said it looked like it was right too.

234
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:20,417
I told you it'd be over
if we got it wrong ten times!

235
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:24,086
You have to consider all the possibilities.

236
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:32,536
Darn it.

237
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:36,136
- Who is it?
- Who's there?

238
00:23:39,437 --> 00:23:40,737
Can you help us?

239
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,647
We need the doctor.

240
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:45,177
My husband got stabbed.

241
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:48,086
He's conscious, but he lost a lot of blood.

242
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:52,987
- Ju Hyung really isn't here.
- Please.

243
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:55,457
We're sorry for everything.
We really are.

244
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:57,957
I said the doctor wasn't here.

245
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,497
Hae Seong, say something.

246
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:02,167
It's really just us here.

247
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:03,727
- Doctor!
- Go away!

248
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:06,866
Open the door!

249
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:09,136
Why does that guy always...

250
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:17,407
Darn it.

251
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:19,376
- Shoot.
- Help us!

252
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:20,846
Open the door!

253
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:22,346
Let us in!

254
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,786
Do you think you'll survive
while the rest of us die?

255
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:28,257
I will set your unit on fire!

256
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:33,757
Darn it.

257
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,606
Open the door!

258
00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:58,586
Doctor.

259
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:05,457
Are you all right?

260
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:22,376
Hello.

261
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:25,116
Did you see that?

262
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:28,217
He was shot in the arm and leg,

263
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,816
but the bleeding already stopped.

264
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:32,816
That's a good thing.
What's the problem?

265
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,786
The smell of his blood.

266
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:37,326
It disgusts me,

267
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,026
and I don't want it.

268
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:41,056
He's infected.

269
00:25:41,366 --> 00:25:42,427
What about my blood, then?

270
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:44,066
Did you want mine?

271
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,667
When I'm talking, will you listen?

272
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:46,937
Don't change the subject.

273
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:48,407
He's infected.

274
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,366
You won't say no.

275
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:52,306
You wanted your sister's blood?

276
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,036
What kind of brother are you?

277
00:25:57,507 --> 00:25:58,616
Are you okay?

278
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:00,717
- Get some water.
- Okay.

279
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:01,786
There's some.

280
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:07,856
What are you two doing here?

281
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:11,526
You were bleeding really badly,

282
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,727
and I couldn't manage on my own.

283
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:18,866
I put that on him in case he had an outbreak.

284
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:28,477
Don't you feel thirsty?

285
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,376
It's not as bad these days.

286
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:32,147
I do feel thirsty,

287
00:26:32,677 --> 00:26:35,846
but diabetes runs in my family.

288
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:41,856
Where's Sae Bom?

289
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:43,427
What?

290
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:45,997
She's not in the complex.

291
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:49,566
The other detective and kid are gone too.

292
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,096
They left, didn't they?

293
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:53,897
The news said everything was fine outside.

294
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:57,267
Except for the places in lockdown,
the martial law was lifted.

295
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,707
Isn't the door open or something?

296
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,907
I don't know what's going on outside.

297
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,116
You shouldn't move.

298
00:27:05,177 --> 00:27:07,046
You have two gunshot wounds.

299
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:12,717
I bit Andrew.

300
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:14,856
What?

301
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:18,856
An infected murderer is even more dangerous.

302
00:27:20,157 --> 00:27:21,356
If he's alive,

303
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:25,167
we must get him.

304
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:29,737
Help him.

305
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,856
Let's look for him as we go down.

306
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,086
Before there are more victims.

307
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:21,417
Okay.

308
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:25,126
The CDCH's speedy diagnosis and action...

309
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,197
led to a lockdown that minimized infection.

310
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:30,167
It looks like mad person disease
will soon become preventable.

311
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,366
An inside source says
a vaccine that's being tested...

312
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:36,167
is showing meaningful results in
preventing the spread.

313
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:38,276
If the results are positive,

314
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:42,647
they will ask the government
for permission to administer it.

315
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:45,576
- Those who were infected...
- Try to drink.

316
00:28:45,647 --> 00:28:47,816
You must eat to keep your energy up.

317
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:51,447
Until a cure is ready,
they will be left in quarantine.

318
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:55,026
The care homes and apartments that are...

319
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:57,457
currently in lockdown will remain
so for a while.

320
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,197
The local community...

321
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:13,606
Look who's here.

322
00:29:13,776 --> 00:29:15,507
It's the brave detective.

323
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,977
Did you get hurt in the Electrical Room?

324
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,447
Was someone injured?

325
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:25,786
The cleaner couple from the second floor.

326
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:27,086
Andrew stabbed him,

327
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:29,286
so I'm looking after him with
a spirit of humanity.

328
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:31,626
I can't find Andrew or Ms. Oh.

329
00:29:32,056 --> 00:29:33,356
Do you know where they are?

330
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:34,626
They must've gone outside.

331
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:39,897
Where's your wife?

332
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:43,106
Andrew's a risk.

333
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:45,036
Don't ever let him in.

334
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:47,507
If possible, my plan...

335
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:49,606
is to make sure you three get punished.

336
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:52,447
My neighbour, Unit 602.

337
00:29:52,947 --> 00:29:55,346
Sang Hee fell for the attorney.

338
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,487
Look at this.

339
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:57,917
She did this to me.

340
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,217
Shouldn't you lock them up first?

341
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:03,856
We were just at Unit 602.

342
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:07,356
The attorney showed us where you'd bit him.

343
00:30:08,397 --> 00:30:10,167
Yes, that was me.

344
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:11,937
I have the disease.

345
00:30:11,997 --> 00:30:14,267
But I'm not the only one.

346
00:30:14,336 --> 00:30:16,066
Just because I bit someone,

347
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:17,937
would anyone charge me?

348
00:30:19,806 --> 00:30:20,836
Mr. Oh.

349
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,276
You're not infected.

350
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:28,846
I know because I am.

351
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:34,056
I'm barely holding back the urge to bite you.

352
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:36,586
I took the pill too.

353
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:37,987
I took the pill!

354
00:30:38,457 --> 00:30:40,697
Taking the pill
doesn't mean you'll get infected.

355
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:43,427
Some show symptoms much later,

356
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,136
and some don't get sick.

357
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,306
- Hello.
- Where's your husband?

358
00:30:52,536 --> 00:30:53,707
In here.

359
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:01,247
He's getting worse.

360
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:02,717
Can you do anything?

361
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:04,786
He has a knife sticking out of him.

362
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:07,286
Of course, he'll get worse.

363
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:08,657
Honey.

364
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:10,126
I'm fine.

365
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:11,457
I'll get better soon.

366
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:16,767
So tell him to get out of my sight.

367
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:19,167
Mister, this is my home!

368
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:37,717
How long can he survive?

369
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,917
He'll die as soon as the knife's removed.

370
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,026
If left as is, maybe a couple of days?

371
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:47,497
I'll find a way to get him out.

372
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:49,167
Watch him until then.

373
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:50,997
I gave him painkillers and my bedroom.

374
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,667
What more can I do?

375
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:56,407
No!

376
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:01,407
That couple.

377
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:03,677
Are they here in case you get thirsty?

378
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,616
That's nonsense. What do you take me for?

379
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:09,217
You took that?

380
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:10,917
So you thought you're infected?

381
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,626
Yes, they're meant to be my packed meal.

382
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:24,796
So what? I took a pill
because I thought I would die!

383
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:27,836
Look after them.

384
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,336
If you cause more trouble,

385
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:33,136
I'll lock you up in the basement.

386
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:36,076
What right do you have to lock me up?

387
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:37,947
Are you some kind of judge?

388
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:39,876
Hey, you!

389
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:01,296
Honey.

390
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:03,437
Take this.

391
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,076
Swallow it.

392
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:09,647
This makes wounds heal right away.

393
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:18,717
Did you swallow it?

394
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:26,596
You love me, don't you?

395
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:29,927
You won't bite me
even if you get infected, right?

396
00:33:41,907 --> 00:33:43,147
Hey.

397
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:44,947
Sir, are you all right?

398
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:49,247
Gosh. Of course, I'm not okay.

399
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:53,657
And you don't look so good either.

400
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,157
How's your wife?

401
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:58,796
Well, we're all right here.

402
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:03,366
Can you please look after my son?

403
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,967
He didn't come back yet?

404
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,806
What?

405
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:10,536
Hold on.

406
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,507
Isn't he staying on the second floor?

407
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:17,247
He said he wanted to leave, but...

408
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:24,187
If you happen to see him,

409
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:28,157
tell him to come back home.
Tell him we're okay.

410
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:30,227
That's what a home is.

411
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:33,596
You come home when things get tough.

412
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:36,026
Okay.

413
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,096
And if Andrew...

414
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,937
Well...

415
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:44,106
If you see a man you've never seen before,
don't open the door.

416
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:45,806
He's really dangerous.

417
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:49,007
Okay.

418
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:52,447
I doubt that he would come here.

419
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:54,447
It's just me and my wife here.

420
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:57,316
Sir, do you have enough food?

421
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:58,986
Should I bring you some more food?

422
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:02,457
Gosh.

423
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:06,256
Why did you offer him food?
We don't have enough for ourselves.

424
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:09,426
I'll give him my share of food.

425
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:11,397
How could you be so selfish?

426
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,147
Gosh.

427
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:33,056
You two should stay away.

428
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:35,786
He's infected.

429
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,756
I saw him bite Andrew.

430
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:41,926
I'm infected too.

431
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:44,567
Let's not fight.

432
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:48,767
It's highly likely
that Andrew is still inside the building.

433
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:54,207
Andrew is dead.

434
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:26,905
I wanted to go out...

435
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:29,076
and talk to the person
in charge of the lockdown.

436
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,277
But there were infected people
in front of the apartment too.

437
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:35,716
But now that we got rid of the murderer,
we can just wait.

438
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,247
So where is his body?

439
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:39,857
Did you move his body?

440
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:42,986
It's on the rooftop.

441
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:46,897
You bit him to death!

442
00:36:48,227 --> 00:36:49,797
No one was on the rooftop.

443
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,236
You must be trying to deceive me.

444
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:58,937
Do you think I'm an idiot? No!

445
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:04,877
I'm perfectly healthy.
I'm not infected like you people!

446
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,846
It's dangerous to be alone now.

447
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:17,286
Goodness, that lady.

448
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:20,156
Do you think
we should just let her be alone?

449
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:23,067
Her family died.

450
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:27,767
She just needs someone to hate.

451
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:31,966
Oh, my chest hurts.

452
00:38:08,707 --> 00:38:12,576
That cop is hiding Andrew's body and lying to me.

453
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:14,877
I should kill him if he keeps messing with me.

454
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:23,608
I guess Andrew and Kim Dong Hyun
must have left the building.

455
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:32,347
What?

456
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:37,588
Hey.

457
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:41,727
(Seyang Forest Le Ciel Apartment)

458
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,968
What are you doing?

459
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,668
What if the infected come into the building?

460
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:54,307
- Don't come out.
- Okay.

461
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,077
Hey.

462
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:25,738
Are you okay?

463
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,608
When did you get bitten?

464
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:44,887
Hey. Isn't that the unemployed guy
from the third floor?

465
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:47,787
I think he's hurt.

466
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:50,298
He's not hurt. He got bitten!

467
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:02,838
Wait. Well,

468
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:07,247
isn't he infected?

469
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:10,218
He hasn't shown any symptoms yet.

470
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,588
He'll be able to hold out longer...

471
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:15,088
if he stays with his family.

472
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:44,278
I'm sorry, Dad.

473
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:48,287
What...

474
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,088
Hey. Oh, no.

475
00:40:54,657 --> 00:40:58,168
Goodness. Honey.

476
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:03,137
Dong Hyun is back.

477
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:07,307
Goodness.

478
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,418
Hey. Moon Hee.

479
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:27,387
Yes?

480
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:32,427
Are you all right?
How are you feeling?

481
00:41:32,997 --> 00:41:34,068
It hurts less.

482
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:36,537
Who gave you that medicine earlier?

483
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:41,108
Moon Hee,

484
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:43,608
should we pull it out?

485
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:45,648
Well...

486
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,177
Okay.

487
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:51,747
Wait.

488
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:56,088
Do you have more medicine?

489
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:58,188
Yes.

490
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:03,898
Give me that.

491
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:12,907
Go ahead.

492
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,238
I'll pull it out.

493
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,608
You know what, Moon Hee?

494
00:42:20,378 --> 00:42:22,747
After everything I've been through,
I can't leave like this.

495
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:26,988
Let's take this house.

496
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:32,088
How?

497
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:48,938
Sir.

498
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:50,807
What is it?

499
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:51,947
Is your husband dead?

500
00:42:54,577 --> 00:42:56,048
We pulled out the knife, and...

501
00:42:56,718 --> 00:42:57,918
My gosh.

502
00:42:58,177 --> 00:42:59,247
I told you not to pull it out.

503
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:00,847
Did he get a lot of blood on the floor?

504
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:03,017
Why don't you people ever listen?

505
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:08,497
Sir.

506
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:11,097
You don't have family, do you?

507
00:43:23,508 --> 00:43:25,977
Hey. Do you think
this looks more swollen than before?

508
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:27,947
Honey.

509
00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:30,278
How many times must I tell you it doesn't?

510
00:43:32,048 --> 00:43:33,247
Are you sure?

511
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,787
That's what I said.

512
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,017
Stop touching it!

513
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:38,628
It's only getting more swollen
because you keep touching it.

514
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,727
Are you sure it's going to be okay?

515
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:47,398
What should we do about the cryptocurrency?

516
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:50,997
We have the password,
but we don't have a laptop.

517
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,407
- Well?
- So...

518
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:54,807
A laptop!

519
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:00,278
Sang Hee!

520
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,517
I'll give you the money,
so open the door!

521
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:04,548
Sang Hee! Open the door!

522
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:07,048
- Sang Hee!
- Is he here to bite us again?

523
00:44:07,787 --> 00:44:09,287
I'll give you the money.

524
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,157
- How much are you going to give me?
- Hey!

525
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:18,528
The cleaning guy is crazy.
He has lost his mind!

526
00:44:20,168 --> 00:44:21,267
Move your hand!

527
00:44:29,477 --> 00:44:31,108
If Ko Se Kyu is in critical condition,

528
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:32,347
we need to get him out.

529
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:33,608
We can't leave him to die here.

530
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:35,077
Detective!

531
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:42,588
Detective! Please save me!

532
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:43,718
I almost died!

533
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:47,028
What is it this time?

534
00:44:48,528 --> 00:44:50,157
He gave us the medicine.

535
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:52,168
He said he'd get better if he took it.

536
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:54,427
Have you lost your mind? I didn't do it!

537
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:57,097
Why would I do such a crazy thing
and increase the number of monsters?

538
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:00,568
Is Ko Se Kyu okay?

539
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:02,177
He's still having a hard time.

540
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:03,438
He's lying down.

541
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:07,577
Can you get rid of him?

542
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:10,278
I'm too scared to be with him.

543
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,918
If you're going to kick anyone out,
it should be them.

544
00:45:13,488 --> 00:45:14,688
You don't believe me?

545
00:45:14,747 --> 00:45:17,188
We're neighbours. We live in the same apartment.

546
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:21,657
I've never heard you acknowledge
we were neighbours before.

547
00:45:23,028 --> 00:45:24,227
I warned you.

548
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:26,068
Let's go to the gym.

549
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:27,327
My laptop.

550
00:45:27,398 --> 00:45:29,068
Tell them to give me my laptop!

551
00:45:29,497 --> 00:45:30,997
Give me my laptop!

552
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:32,407
My laptop!

553
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:36,738
Get the elevator.

554
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:44,648
Are you glad I'm leaving?

555
00:45:47,218 --> 00:45:48,557
- Oh, my!
- Gosh.

556
00:45:58,427 --> 00:45:59,727
What are you doing?

557
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:02,097
Where are you taking the doctor?

558
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:04,298
We're quarantining him.

559
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:08,068
If you don't want to end up like this,
be careful.

560
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:24,218
Honey.

561
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,758
Is all of this ours?

562
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:28,157
Of course.

563
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:30,227
He doesn't even have any family.

564
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,168
He almost killed me.

565
00:46:34,398 --> 00:46:35,637
We could demand...

566
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:37,738
this place from him as compensation.

567
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,468
He'll tell us he won't give it to us.

568
00:46:41,238 --> 00:46:43,108
We can kill him before the lockdown ends.

569
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:45,677
They'll just assume the infected did it.

570
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:48,108
Right?

571
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:50,977
Gosh, that hurt.

572
00:46:51,778 --> 00:46:52,988
That hurts.

573
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:55,887
Give me some water.

574
00:46:56,157 --> 00:46:57,218
Okay.

575
00:47:12,068 --> 00:47:13,367
Take some of this too.

576
00:47:17,508 --> 00:47:19,048
I feel really thirsty for some reason.

577
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,758
How many is this?

578
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:36,197
One.

579
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:39,227
Two.

580
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:41,938
Three.

581
00:47:55,218 --> 00:47:58,477
Why didn't you leave with your wife?

582
00:48:04,387 --> 00:48:06,488
I need to watch the house until Sae Bom gets back.

583
00:48:07,827 --> 00:48:08,997
We went through a lot...

584
00:48:09,057 --> 00:48:12,028
to get this place as a special provision
for civil servants.

585
00:48:18,037 --> 00:48:21,108
I know you were worried about us.

586
00:48:22,537 --> 00:48:24,008
If it wasn't for you,

587
00:48:24,907 --> 00:48:27,247
something big would've happened.

588
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:30,548
Thank you.

589
00:48:36,387 --> 00:48:39,628
I'm going to get some rest
and go look for Andrew again.

590
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:43,057
It could get dangerous, so you should go home.

591
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:45,367
We can help you too.

592
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:48,367
I could be dangerous too.

593
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,608
You seemed to be a lot better now,

594
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:56,307
but that's not the case for me.

595
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:04,878
Be careful.

596
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:02,537
Sae Bom.

597
00:50:06,947 --> 00:50:08,048
Are you doing okay?

598
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:23,358
I miss you.

599
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:52,958
We're alive thanks to him.

600
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:55,727
He's infected, but...

601
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:57,798
So he's home?

602
00:50:59,168 --> 00:51:01,327
It's dangerous,
so don't go outside and stay home.

603
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:03,338
The lockdown will end soon!

604
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:04,597
What? Really?

605
00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:06,807
See? I told you!
She said we shouldn't go out!

606
00:51:08,508 --> 00:51:09,537
No way.

607
00:51:26,227 --> 00:51:27,287
Hey!

608
00:51:28,057 --> 00:51:30,628
Sang Hee. I knew you'd come.

609
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:33,097
Honey. Let me go.

610
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:35,398
Let's talk after you let go.

611
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:38,738
What will you do without a key?

612
00:51:39,738 --> 00:51:41,907
Ms. Oh. Help me.

613
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:44,307
I just came to help him.

614
00:51:45,008 --> 00:51:46,407
Have you lost your mind?

615
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,017
Shouldn't we...

616
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,188
get rid of that jerk of a detective?

617
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:56,858
Since that woman ran away,

618
00:51:56,918 --> 00:51:58,517
we just need to get rid of that jerk.

619
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:01,887
Are you...

620
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,597
suggesting we kill the detective?

621
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:06,597
He's infected.

622
00:52:09,537 --> 00:52:11,497
We can use this to break you free.

623
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:13,637
Just do what I tell you.

624
00:52:30,057 --> 00:52:31,758
Help me!

625
00:52:45,637 --> 00:52:46,668
Mr. Oh.

626
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:49,108
Calm down.

627
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:51,677
Let her go.

628
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:52,947
Mr. Jung.

629
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:55,947
Kill all the non-infected people...

630
00:52:57,177 --> 00:53:00,188
and blame it on the disease.

631
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:01,318
That's it.

632
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,557
Blame it all on the monsters.

633
00:53:05,628 --> 00:53:08,557
You are the real monsters, not the infected.

634
00:53:10,097 --> 00:53:12,398
You feel thirsty, don't you?

635
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:27,548
Shall we see who the real monster is?

636
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:33,447
Go.

637
00:53:47,468 --> 00:53:48,597
Jung Yi Hyun!

638
00:53:48,997 --> 00:53:50,137
Jung Yi Hyun!

639
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:52,238
Don't you love the smell of blood?

640
00:53:52,307 --> 00:53:55,137
Don't hold back!
You must've held back your whole life!

641
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,407
Jung Yi Hyun!

642
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:58,008
Jung Yi Hyun!

643
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,577
Come on outside!

644
00:54:00,747 --> 00:54:02,718
Come outside!

645
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:04,278
Get out here!

646
00:54:08,951 --> 00:54:10,282
Why won't you listen to me?

647
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:13,992
It's my apartment. Listen to me!

648
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:23,061
Calm down! I'm not here to get you.

649
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:29,802
You killed my husband.

650
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,012
I caught an infected person,
and I'm still clean.

651
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:34,842
I deserve to be a representative.

652
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:35,942
Okay.

653
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:38,811
I'll vote for you when you get out of prison.

654
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:42,751
- Okay.
- Get out here!

655
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,782
Come on outside!

656
00:54:45,351 --> 00:54:48,822
Hey! I will change soon, you know!

657
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:50,922
I will show symptoms too!

658
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:54,431
You're dead.

659
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:18,021
Yi Hyun.

660
00:55:24,962 --> 00:55:26,161
I'm back.

661
00:55:43,512 --> 00:55:45,081
I realized when you said...

662
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:48,152
that a home...

663
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:52,451
depended on whom you were with.

664
00:55:56,492 --> 00:55:59,462
I'll stay with you from now on.

665
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:05,771
Stay with me.

666
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:47,811
Whatever you're like,

667
00:56:48,811 --> 00:56:50,041
I'm okay with everything.

668
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:05,790
Are you sure there's someone...

669
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,052
with the antibodies in the apartment?

670
00:58:07,391 --> 00:58:08,552
I got a statement.

671
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:12,462
Tell me everything you know about the infected.

672
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:15,161
I might need the information to make a cure.

673
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:18,201
I don't know much.

674
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,371
Na Hyun Kyung said that...

675
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:23,242
her brother's wounds were the same.

676
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:26,371
They didn't get better or get worse.

677
00:58:26,472 --> 00:58:28,981
You asked for full authority based on that?

678
00:58:29,512 --> 00:58:30,512
Ji Soo.

679
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:35,081
Since when did we have anything to rely on?

680
00:58:56,101 --> 00:58:58,572
Hae Seong. Please open the door.

681
00:58:58,641 --> 00:59:00,041
I got the cryptocurrency.

682
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:03,212
I put you through a lot, didn't I?

683
00:59:03,282 --> 00:59:05,552
I'm sorry for being a nervous wreck.

684
00:59:05,612 --> 00:59:06,652
(Shin So Yoon)

685
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:10,052
I did it so we could all be happy.

686
00:59:11,222 --> 00:59:12,251
(Message read)

687
00:59:12,322 --> 00:59:13,751
Are you listening?

688
00:59:14,222 --> 00:59:15,222
Hae Seong.

689
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:16,521
(Shin So Yoon)

690
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:19,632
Hae Seong.

691
00:59:19,692 --> 00:59:22,302
Honey. We can be happy now.

692
00:59:22,362 --> 00:59:24,231
- So Yoon?
- Open the door.

693
00:59:25,032 --> 00:59:28,472
I am so sorry for everything.
It's all on me.

694
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:29,501
- Okay?
- Hae Seong!

695
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:31,001
Don't contact me ever again.

696
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:34,041
- No, I really...
- Hae Seong. You're in there, right?

697
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,012
I really regret everything. I really do.

698
00:59:37,612 --> 00:59:39,351
- Okay?
- Do you hear me?

699
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,512
Open the door.

700
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:43,382
But I really do regret everything.

701
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,351
We can be happy.

702
00:59:45,592 --> 00:59:46,592
Hae Seong.

703
00:59:47,891 --> 00:59:48,891
The receiver cannot...

704
00:59:48,892 --> 00:59:50,891
- Honey.
- Shoot.

705
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:59,072
Hae Seong. We had some good times.

706
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:02,001
It can get even better.

707
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:05,201
Let me in.

708
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:06,972
Open the door.

709
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:10,981
Something is better than nothing.

710
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:16,021
- Darn you.
- Were you bitten?

711
01:00:18,922 --> 01:00:20,092
(Shin So Yoon)

712
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:23,521
Is the Internet working?

713
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:27,061
I'll give you some cryptocurrency.

714
01:00:28,632 --> 01:00:29,862
What's the password?

715
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:31,001
Oh, hang on.

716
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:41,541
(Welcome to OPbit.)

717
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:46,411
(Welcome to OPbit. Follow the steps.)

718
01:00:54,592 --> 01:00:55,592
Look.

719
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:05,261
(Valuated profit or loss)

720
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,632
(Total 7,824 dollars, Loss of 99.98 percent)

721
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:09,742
All economic indicators show a bleak forecast.

722
01:01:10,442 --> 01:01:14,012
Stock markets worldwide as well are in Korea
are crashing,

723
01:01:14,072 --> 01:01:18,012
and over 30 items
on the Korean stock exchange plummeted.

724
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:21,552
Prices of crude oil, gold,
and various raw materials are falling.

725
01:01:21,782 --> 01:01:23,521
Crude oil went down from 80 dollars...

726
01:01:23,581 --> 01:01:26,451
They'll find a cure one day.

727
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:29,962
At this rate, they will find a cure soon.

728
01:01:30,592 --> 01:01:32,791
I bet the people from the health center...

729
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,362
will come here and ring the bell any second now.

730
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:37,831
- I'm sure of it.
- The prices continue to plummet.

731
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,101
As of today, the market capitalization...

732
01:01:40,532 --> 01:01:43,601
has gone down by 97 percent
compared to 3 months ago.

733
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:45,371
What...

734
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:46,911
- Goodness.
- Hey!

735
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,141
Gosh.

736
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:51,112
What...

737
01:01:51,181 --> 01:01:52,212
Mom.

738
01:01:52,282 --> 01:01:54,251
They are here! We made it.

739
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:56,822
- Didn't I tell you?
- Gosh.

740
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:58,382
I told you that they would come.

741
01:01:58,451 --> 01:01:59,621
- Did I tell you?
- You did.

742
01:01:59,692 --> 01:02:01,121
- Goodness.
- Please be gentle.

743
01:02:01,192 --> 01:02:02,291
We'll be okay!

744
01:02:03,222 --> 01:02:04,621
Gosh, honey.

745
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,092
We'll be okay.

746
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,431
Thank you.

747
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:18,442
Wait. I never bit anyone.

748
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:19,811
I'm telling you the truth.

749
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:21,911
I don't even feel thirsty.

750
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:24,681
Give me water and see.
I'm serious. I'm not thirsty.

751
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:26,382
I'm telling the truth.

752
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:27,581
I never bit anyone.

753
01:02:27,652 --> 01:02:29,081
He was completely fine.

754
01:02:29,422 --> 01:02:31,781
He might have recovered by now.
No. I think he's fine now.

755
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:32,922
- You're fine, aren't you?
- Yes.

756
01:02:32,992 --> 01:02:35,121
I'm fine now.
I don't feel thirsty now.

757
01:02:44,462 --> 01:02:45,771
He's fine. Right?

758
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,442
- I'm not thirsty.
- Don't talk too much.

759
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:51,001
I'm serious.

760
01:02:56,382 --> 01:02:58,481
We found a man with the antibodies.
I'll transport him now.

761
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,311
I'll handle...

762
01:03:03,382 --> 01:03:04,681
Yoon Sae Bom.

763
01:03:05,152 --> 01:03:06,351
Whatever.

764
01:03:06,422 --> 01:03:07,652
Just bring the guy with the antibodies.

765
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:12,061
Keep him safe.

766
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:14,561
Take Yoon Sae Bom and Jung Yi Hyun...

767
01:03:16,462 --> 01:03:17,532
to the dormitory.

768
01:03:19,001 --> 01:03:20,032
Okay.

769
01:03:20,472 --> 01:03:22,371
No!

770
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:24,371
This is my house! You can't come in!

771
01:03:24,442 --> 01:03:26,172
No! Stop it!

772
01:03:26,342 --> 01:03:28,871
Honey! Stop them. Come on!

773
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:31,141
- This is my house!
- No!

774
01:03:31,212 --> 01:03:32,612
No!

775
01:03:33,311 --> 01:03:35,052
- Honey, take them.
- Oh, no.

776
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:36,181
No!

777
01:03:38,822 --> 01:03:39,851
- This is our house!
- This is mine!

778
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:41,552
- No!
- I'm taking everything with me!

779
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:43,692
- No! They are mine!
- This is our house!

780
01:03:43,762 --> 01:03:45,061
- This is our house!
- Mine!

781
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,132
- No! This is our house!
- They are mine!

782
01:03:47,192 --> 01:03:48,791
I'm taking them with me!

783
01:03:49,262 --> 01:03:50,431
- Let go of me!
- Let go!

784
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:52,262
- This is our house!
- I'm taking what's mine!

785
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:53,331
- Mine!
- Honey!

786
01:03:53,402 --> 01:03:54,672
This is our house!

787
01:03:57,701 --> 01:03:58,871
Just stay here...

788
01:03:59,342 --> 01:04:00,672
even if it's hot here.

789
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:03,442
Don't you dare think this is the end.

790
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:05,282
I'm serious. Mark my words.

791
01:04:05,981 --> 01:04:07,052
Sae Bom.

792
01:04:07,112 --> 01:04:08,911
You'll vote for me, right?

793
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,322
Sure. Let's go.

794
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:30,302
We shouldn't leave...

795
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,072
Mr. Kim Se Hoon here, right?

796
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:36,541
Let's move him to his house.

797
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:38,811
I'll open the door.

798
01:05:10,342 --> 01:05:11,942
Call Yoon Sae Bom here.

799
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:39,942
Drop the gun, Ms. Yoon.

800
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:41,712
Just shoot him.

801
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,112
I can take a hit.

802
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:49,382
Drop the gun if you want him to live!

803
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:50,951
Never. Just shoot him now!

804
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:22,751
It's fresh blood.

805
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:08,991
Yi Hyun.

806
01:07:10,962 --> 01:07:12,062
Yi Hyun.

807
01:07:19,972 --> 01:07:21,041
I told you...

808
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:23,682
that I was going to be the bad cop.

809
01:07:25,281 --> 01:07:26,352
You should stay...

810
01:07:27,852 --> 01:07:29,281
as the good cop.

811
01:07:33,651 --> 01:07:34,751
Hey.

812
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:43,732
Yi Hyun.

813
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:47,401
Yi Hyun.

814
01:07:47,472 --> 01:07:48,571
No. You can't...

815
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:51,371
Yi Hyun!

816
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:54,241
No. Yi Hyun!

817
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:16,861
(Grand Courtroom 417)

818
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:42,762
(Attorney, Defendant)

819
01:09:08,951 --> 01:09:10,151
Mr. Lee Seung Young.

820
01:09:48,151 --> 01:09:49,392
Be careful.

821
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:52,092
Aren't you tired after all that running?

822
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:54,291
- I'm not tired at all.
- Really?

823
01:09:54,932 --> 01:09:57,462
Then shall we take it up a notch?
What do you say?

824
01:09:57,531 --> 01:09:58,602
How about the gym?

825
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,201
All the residents can use the facility now.

826
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,142
I have plans.
So I have to go back home.

827
01:10:08,312 --> 01:10:09,342
What?

828
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:11,411
- Bye.
- What plan?

829
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,611
Seo Yoon.

830
01:10:14,111 --> 01:10:16,151
All right. Let's get going then.

831
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:26,361
What are you thinking?

832
01:10:27,331 --> 01:10:28,562
Last year...

833
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,331
during the lockdown.

834
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,302
It was tough, wasn't it?

835
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,302
Yes, but...

836
01:10:36,901 --> 01:10:38,441
it was bearable with you.

837
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:45,382
When did you start liking me?

838
01:10:46,882 --> 01:10:48,911
I told you I fell for you
the first time I saw you.

839
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,581
Why won't you believe me?

840
01:10:50,682 --> 01:10:52,052
I knew you were my destiny.

841
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,450
I said to myself that you were the one.

842
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:57,092
So you never gave up?

843
01:10:58,092 --> 01:10:59,691
Why do you think I became a cop?

844
01:10:59,762 --> 01:11:00,791
Hey.

845
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:02,462
Don't tell me you became a cop
because of me.

846
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,031
I thought about going to the States.

847
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:06,932
But I couldn't stop thinking
about what you said.

848
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:08,931
You said our future had so many options,

849
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,272
so I should take the plunge.

850
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,102
Then you went with the SOU.

851
01:11:12,172 --> 01:11:14,111
Hey, I had no idea.

852
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:18,682
So...

853
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:20,111
are you happy now?

854
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:24,382
Of course.

855
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:26,191
Only when I'm with you.

856
01:11:28,892 --> 01:11:31,062
- I'm not happy otherwise.
- Stop lying.

857
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:36,401
The first one there will be exempt
from recycling duty for a week!

858
01:11:36,462 --> 01:11:37,802
You're cheating! Hey!

859
01:11:38,262 --> 01:11:40,071
Including the food garbage!

860
01:11:40,132 --> 01:11:41,531
I refuse to lose!

861
01:11:42,701 --> 01:11:47,472
=Happiness=

862
01:12:57,812 --> 01:13:01,151
(Thank you for watching and supporting "Happiness".)
