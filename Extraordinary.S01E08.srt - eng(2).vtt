Feifan

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
Father will return after delivering
the military pay.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.359
Father

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.799
Let Ping'an take people for this.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.120
Why do you need to go yourself?

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:09.480
No, I can't.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:11.799
What if someone tampers with it?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.760
I must deliver it myself.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:17.040
Father

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.920
We need manpower for coal mining now.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.159
I heard that retired wounded soldiers

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.640
mostly live hard lives.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:24.879
Instead of hiring outsiders,

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.799
why not use our own people?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.959
Let them earn more income

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.000
to help their families.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:32.519
That's great.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.359
My son has grown up.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.239
He cares for the soldiers.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.840
On behalf of those old and wounded,

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:49.319
thank you.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.159
I'm leaving.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.920
Take care, Father.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.240
Young Duke

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.360
It's late at night.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.919
Why aren't you sleeping?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.759
Don't tell me you're lost again.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.319
I think these flowers are beautiful.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:05.560
Admiring flowers.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080
Even prettier than those in the palace.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.840
Young Duke

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.520
Young Duke

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.400
The mine collapsed.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.159
Luckily, it happened at night.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.639
No workers were mining below.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.000
How could such a good mine

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.560
collapse so suddenly?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.400
How is Celestial Star Tower's investigation?

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.520
The mastermind is well hidden.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.919
But

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.599
there are clues suggesting

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.479
the Governor of Shu Province massacre

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.919
may be linked to Celestial Star Tower.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.599
Keep investigating.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.159
Yes.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.039
Young Duke

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.560
Fan Lou's manager says monthly pay
wasn't given.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.560
The staff are demanding to report it.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.639
Let's go.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.120
Go.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.919
Hurry, move! Go!

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.520
Go, hurry up, move!

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.360
What's going on?

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.120
You all, leave.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.680
What are you doing?

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.400
What are you up to?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.279
Young Duke, stop!

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.480
You're finally here, Young Duke Shi.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.480
You're finally here.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.920
Young Duke

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.680
Please don't make things hard
for us poor folks.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.279
That's right.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.079
We can't even put food on the table.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.879
Exactly.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:26.560
Zhi'er

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.120
Thank you.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.279
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:42.079
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:42.560
Thank you, Young Duke.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.319
Go, go, go.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.959
You can't just leave like this, why?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.560
Why not leave? Why?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.519
You can't just leave.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.639
If we stay, we'll starve here.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.120
That's right.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.000
Can't leave.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.519
Come back, everyone.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.720
You've all worked at Fan Lou for years.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.360
Your feelings for Fan Lou
are deeper than mine.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.319
Besides, the monthly pay here

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:59.959
is higher than other restaurants.

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.160
Trust me.

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.000
This is only temporary.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.279
How can we trust that?

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.199
Fan Lou has a prime location,

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.000
but its positioning is too high-end.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.079
It keeps many customers away.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.879
Fan Lou needs reform.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.839
If prices are lower,

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.680
we'll attract more guests.

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.519
Please think it over carefully.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.160
I, Shi Feifan, promise you all

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:22.839
if monthly pay isn't given,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.959
you'll get triple compensation.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.000
Triple?

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.519
Triple?

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.199
That's a lot.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.800
Yeah, that's too much.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:30.959
Young Duke

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:33.800
We don't have that much silver.

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.000
I'll stay.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.600
A prodigal's return is priceless.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.399
I'll stay too.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.079
Who's a prodigal?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.199
Our Young Duke has long reformed.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.399
Go.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.959
Well...

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.319
Young Duke, you said to reform—

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.439
do you have a good plan?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.560
Close for one day.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.160
Why close again?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.759
Closed.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.639
Yeah.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.600
Xinjiang Big Plate Chicken.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.720
No.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.519
Northeast BBQ.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.839
Not suitable either.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:20.720
Peking Duck.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.480
We don't have the skills.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.560
What should we make?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.079
What to make, what to give?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.160
What should we give?

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.040
What are you muttering about?

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:37.040
Young Duke

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.680
I have a friend—

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.720
the girl he likes has a birthday.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.439
What do you think he should give her?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.120
Shuang'er

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.759
Right.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.639
No, no, not her.

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.600
I know what you're thinking
when you look away.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.240
Birthday.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.959
Got it!

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:13.240
What's this?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.279
Here it comes!

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.600
Slow down.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.199
Young Duke, what's this?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.519
Why are you all standing there?

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:27.720
Sit down and eat.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.639
Eat.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.839
Y-Young Duke

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.720
This...

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.240
This

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:40.319
This... this is

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.000
This

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:43.839
Don't worry.

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:44.839
This isn't a farewell meal.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.279
Internal tasting.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.399
Tasting.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.680
Sit, sit, sit.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.639
Try... try the food.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.800
Sit, sit, sit. Sit down.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:52.839
Sit, sit, sit.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.199
Delicious.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.399
Even tastier than imperial cuisine.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:22.959
Well...

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.839
I mean, better than fish.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.480
Even tastier than eel.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.519
Young Duke, that's not fair.

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:31.079
I want some too.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.639
Even eating can't shut you up.

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:42.639
Hot, hot, hot!

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.039
Delicious.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.120
Hurry, try it. Try it.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360
Great, come on, come on.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.120
Shuang'er, you try it too.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.639
Try it, try it.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:51.600
Thank you, Young Duke.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.120
Try this one.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.279
Delicious.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.960
Come on, come on.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.399
Smells amazing.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:03.320
Delicious, delicious.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:06.759
Young Duke.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.720
I've never had food this good.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:11.159
What's this dish called?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.200
A catchy name.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.320
Congratulations!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.559
Good.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.039
Never seen this before.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.639
Yes.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:40.080
Good, good.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.879
Congratulations on your opening.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.879
This way, please. This way.

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:43.960
Congratulations.

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:48.879
Everyone, please be patient.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.240
Good food takes time.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:53.679
Today is Shi Fu Lao Hot Pot's grand opening.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.120
Everything is 20% off.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.639
You might win a free meal.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:00.919
Great.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.559
Great.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:03.720
No need to rush, everyone.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:05.720
Come, line up here for a number.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.799
Queue here, come on, come on.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.480
Come on, come on.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.000
Come on, come in, please come in.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:10.399
Please come in.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.320
Please, inside.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.840
Hold onto this.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.399
Please come in, please come in.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:12.919
Come.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:13.720
No rush.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.600
Please, inside.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.519
Come, come.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:16.200
Come on, come on.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:17.720
Come, please come in, please come in.

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:18.440
Hold onto this.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.840
Hold this, please go inside, it's yours.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:21.279
Please, inside.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:22.480
Hold onto it.

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:26.600
Please, inside.

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:28.120
Come.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:31.320
Well done.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.840
Those two acted well.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.320
Might need them again.

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:37.679
Give them double pay.

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:38.840
Understood.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.559
So you all...

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:41.879
Please, inside.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.639
Please, inside.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:53.000
This is our seat.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.080
Nonsense.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:55.000
This is clearly my seat.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.360
How could it be yours?

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.120
This is clearly my seat.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:58.120
We sat here when we arrived.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:10:59.120
This really is our seat.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.080
It's clearly my seat.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.039
This is my seat.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.919
I sat here as soon as I came.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.480
This is my seat.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.840
You two, please be patient.

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.799
Please show me the number you got at the door.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.559
Alright, alright.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.039
Sorry, sir.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:18.399
This guest did arrive a bit earlier than you.

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:20.480
Please wait at the entrance for a moment.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.320
Is this how you run your business?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:23.759
How about this...

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.759
In a moment,

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.759
we'll give you a free bowl of noodles.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:27.799
Is that alright with you?

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.440
That's fine.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:31.759
Thanks for understanding. Let's go.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.000
Alright.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.000
Please have a seat. Okay.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:37.600
Please wait at the entrance.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.279
Dear guests,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.200
I'm the owner of this restaurant.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.440
Thank you all for your support.

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:56.080
To show our appreciation,

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:57.360
we've launched

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.559
a top-up membership promotion.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.080
Members can earn points.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.240
Points can be redeemed for dishes.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.279
Lots of benefits.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:09.200
If you want to share with family,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.919
Shi Fu Lao Hot Pot offers free takeout.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.919
Thank you all for your support.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.679
I'll leave you to enjoy your meal.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.080
Enjoy your food and drinks.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.080
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.080
Good.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.759
Honestly,

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:45.559
this fool has some skills.

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:48.679
This dish doesn't seem hard.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:50.159
Yue Ying.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.519
Go get Guo Yuchu.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.360
I want to open

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.120
Yufu Lao.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.919
Yes.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.559
Really?

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:10.440
Go check out Yufu Lao.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:11.480
That's great.

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.000
Go, go, go! Hurry up!

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.600
Young Duke.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.360
Shi Fu Lao Hot Pot just got popular.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.600
And now they're copying us already.

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:28.159
Copying, huh?

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.879
Then let's do something they can't.
