00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.720
In the world where I come from,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.400
you are already gone.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.480
That's why I came to find you.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.960
So, at that time,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
you would tell me

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.000
you're on your own now.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.160
If you catch a cold,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.760
who will take care of you?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.040
How did you know?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.320
So sometimes,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.640
I feel like I'm not myself.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.400
I told you I have another personality,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.240
but actually,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.880
Yu Xingchen

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.560
was lying to you.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.920
He fell down on his own.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.280
How did I end up here?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.440
So,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.280
you sometimes get like that.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.440
You know so much.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.680
You don't seem like a high schooler.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.720
I'm much older now.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.960
I've had more takeout than you've had meals.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.880
So,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.080
that's why you're different from the old Yu Xingchen.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.280
Su Ruo

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.920
I hope I can change your fate.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.240
I won't let you stay with this person.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.040
I'll take you away.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
That's why you showed up here.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.840
I want you to live happily.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800
That's why you came to me.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.520
I want you to see the people around you clearly.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.320
Someday, a boy will really like you.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.120
He'll treat you well.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
Will you

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.240
accept him?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.120
That's why you said those things to me.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.400
I don't know if I can make myself clear.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.880
Everything I've done

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.160
was to help you survive.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.400
Please remember one place.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.880
It's called Jianshe Community.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.320
Fifteen years from now,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.480
you must never rent a place there.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.560
Actually, these words

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.600
should've been said the first time I came.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.960
I should've told you then.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.960
But I wasn't sure.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.640
I was afraid you wouldn't trust me then.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.960
Actually,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.760
even this time,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.400
I still don't know

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.320
if you'll believe me.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.360
You made it very clear.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.080
But how am I supposed to believe you?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.400
If you still don't believe me,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.880
I can tell you something

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.240
that's about to happen.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.600
Hey, class leader.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.800
Six hundred eighteen points.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.600
Congratulations, then.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.480
I want to ask you one more thing.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.960
Where did you apply for college?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.000
The class leader scored 618 on the exam.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.080
She went to Jiangcheng Social University, finance major.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.800
Now,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.720
I'm leaving.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.120
If nothing goes wrong,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.440
I won't be able to come back.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.400
Luckily, before I go,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.600
I can give you your exam admission ticket.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.520
Teacher Jiang always says

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.240
the college entrance exam changes your fate.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.080
It's true.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.520
I believe you'll get into the best university.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.400
The only thing I didn't expect

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760
is that after fifteen whole years,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.440
I still fell for you.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.720
Even though I didn't hear your reply myself,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.640
but this time,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.880
please let me be a little selfish.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.040
Su Ruo

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.160
Fifteen years from now,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.520
let's meet again.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.600
I already answered you.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.000
I already answered you.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.360
I told you I like you.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.040
Why are you crying?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.440
Yu Xingchen

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.160
Why did you come here?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.840
I'm reporting to the exam retake class tomorrow.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.960
I came to ask the teacher about it today.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.040
I just happened to pass by.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.480
I heard about it.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.160
You didn't do well on the Chinese exam.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.280
It's all my fault.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.880
How could it be your fault?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.680
Good luck.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.560
You'll definitely get into a good university.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.320
Su Ruo

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.840
I have something to tell you.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.120
But you seemed so sad just now,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.080
I thought it wasn't the right time.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.640
I...

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.000
It's okay.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.800
As long as it's from you,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.640
anything is fine.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.040
Yu Xingchen,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.920
are you trying to say

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.440
you like me?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.240
I got it.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.760
I'll wait for you.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.640
Wait...

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.760
I...

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.840
Please,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.800
wait for me too.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.120
Gone.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.400
Finally, everything is gone.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.440
Everything about me has changed.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.360
I didn't get into Dongda's physics major.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.840
The me here

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.800
is just like so many other workers,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.280
living an ordinary, fulfilling life.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.640
The world didn't change because of my recklessness.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.800
Nothing was altered.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.880
People hurry back and forth.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.880
Young people stare down at their phones.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.600
World War II hero veterans pass away.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.240
Celebrities clarify they haven't cheated.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.400
TOMORROW'S STAR finals spark scandal debate.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.400
Nothing has changed.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.120
And yet, none of it seems to concern me.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.360
Old Yu

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560
Long time no see.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.560
It's been two years, hasn't it?

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.560
Fifteen years have reshaped everything.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.880
It's become a little unfamiliar to me

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.640
yet still feels like a familiar world.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.160
Hello, let me introduce myself.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.960
-Introduce yourself -Everyone is working hard
to change.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.080
Everyone is striving to grow.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.120
Except

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.320
I feel like I've been left behind.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.240
Yu Xingchen here

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.040
wasted a year in the exam retake class.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.400
Lost old college friends

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.840
and also lost

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.000
a cherished school and job.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.160
I've been feeling down lately.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.320
Our company had layoffs too.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.000
It's so frustrating.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.040
Taking care of family is tough too.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.080
And

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.520
now there are two of us.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.520
Here,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.320
there really isn't anyone named Su Ruo.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.920
I think

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.200
I haven't let anyone down.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.600
You've grown up.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.720
Look at you, look at you.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.400
You were right to trust me.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.360
Good thing we found out early.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.560
You're getting more capable.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.080
You,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.400
now you're teaching me.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.480
You, you.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.400
What would you do without me?

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.560
Today, I'm so happy.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.320
Let's go home.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.240
Okay.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.840
I've asked myself many times

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.360
if giving up everything

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.320
over and over again

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.640
Loading progress

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.040
doing this

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.440
is it really worth it?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.080
I don't know.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.160
Have you

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.560
visited Lao Jiang lately?

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.040
He

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.160
Is he doing well?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.240
Cancer.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.240
Luckily, it was found in time.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.560
He had a minor surgery.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.920
Now

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.240
he's fine.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.800
Really?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.560
That's great.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.640
All these years,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.320
you haven't kept in touch with classmates?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.960
I've lost contact with many people.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.600
That's a strange thing to say.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.840
Aren't you the one not keeping in touch?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.080
That's true.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.720
But I understand.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.280
You were in the exam retake class that year.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.400
You were a year behind us.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.240
When we started college, you were retaking exams.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.960
We graduated and started working,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.840
but you were still studying.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.280
Actually,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.200
Lao Jiang always felt sorry for you.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.600
He said back then

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.920
you just messed up on the Chinese exam.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.280
Well,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.240
who hasn't made mistakes?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.200
Are you still in touch with Su Ruo?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.360
Her?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.800
She's even more extreme.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.240
She hasn't contacted us for fifteen years.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.400
She went abroad alone.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.760
Many say she's cold-hearted.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.880
In my view,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.240
maybe she's

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.840
avoiding something.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.880
Or waiting for something.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.560
Maybe

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.600
I'm waiting for someone too.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.880
Come on, let's have a drink.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.720
Sounds good.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.760
Come on, cheers.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.200
Okay.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.400
Impressive.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.200
Sounds nice.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.880
Hey superstar, sing one too.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.640
Sing one, sing one, sing one.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.480
If I sing,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.240
none of you will want to sing.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.320
There you go bragging again.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:39.760
Come on.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.840
Look at him.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.160
Showing off.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.960
Chen,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.240
Oh wow.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.400
A rare guest!

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.400
Stop looking.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.240
She's still abroad.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.560
Haven't heard she's back.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.240
Come, come, come.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.920
Sit, sit, sit.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.360
Sit.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.480
Come, come, come.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.280
Come, come, come.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.640
Sit, sit, sit.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.080
Come.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.920
Come.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.920
Let's get hyped!

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.120
I'll sing a song with Chen.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.160
Go ahead and sing.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.240
Okay.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.120
Sing.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.720
Sing!

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.480
This old shop

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240
has finally opened.
