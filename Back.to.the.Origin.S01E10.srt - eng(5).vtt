00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.800
Brother, you know,

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.600
that woman is an outsider.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.920
She has no idea how things work.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.920
Or she wouldn't dare steal my contract.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.120
I told her

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.680
our whole family

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.600
has been in the garment business

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.280
for decades.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.280
Think about our dad,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.520
and you, my brothers.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.120
I told her to ask around.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.880
here in Lucheng City,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.039
anyone in this business

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.440
knows our family.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.160
How dare she steal my contract!

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.920
Getting that contract

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.560
would be a piece of cake for you.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.280
Yeah.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.919
This is our signature dish, the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.280
world-famous Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.000
Shall I serve it for you?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.640
Please do.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.320
Okay.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.320
Brother,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.800
this is authentic,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.520
sells for 2,999 yuan.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.720
Usually, I would never

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.240
order this.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.440
But today,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.680
we're all getting to enjoy this thanks to you.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.560
Sis, say thank you to your third brother.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.400
Thank you.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.680
Actually, if we're talking about thanks,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.200
we should thank Kaiyang.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:34.640
Right?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.280
Yes, thanks to Kaiyang.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.280
Today's dinner is for

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.600
welcoming Kaiyang home.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.320
Serve it first to

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.120
the young man back from abroad.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.880
How's Grandma been lately?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.480
She's fine.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.200
Kaiyang,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.960
you're living with Grandma now.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:56.920
Make sure you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.160
remind her often

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.360
to keep her diabetes

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
under control.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.480
Your grandma can be difficult.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.040
You'll have to look after her.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.840
Grandma's had diabetes

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.520
for over ten years.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.520
I remember it clearly.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.600
That year,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.280
she moved to Lucheng City with you.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.600
I had

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.960
just given birth to your cousin.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.720
I asked your grandma

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.360
if she could

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.520
help me look after the baby.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.800
And you know what she said?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.520
"No. I'm diabetic."

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.360
So, Kaiyang,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.800
among all the kids

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.840
in our family,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.800
you're the luckiest.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:30.560
Only you

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.840
were raised by Grandma.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400
The other kids,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.800
she didn't take care of any.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.600
I was a handful as a kid.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.320
She was busy with me,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.440
so she couldn't handle my siblings.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.920
Guess that's on me.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.440
Excuse me,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.079
all dishes have been served.

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:45.640
Enjoy your meal.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.120
Great, thanks.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.720
Brother,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.800
no outsider's around now.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.000
Let's talk about what's really going on.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920
All dishes are here.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.640
Let's eat.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.120
Go ahead.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.240
Dig in.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.800
Go ahead.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.320
Don't be shy.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.760
Try the crispy duck.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.120
Eat.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.200
So, how did it go

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.560
with the lawyer this morning?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.160
I was just about to bring that up.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280
The lawyer said my dad should

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.400
return the illegal gains as soon as possible

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.640
in exchange for a lighter sentence.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.120
He's pretty experienced

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.080
with cases like this.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.720
As for the lawyer's fee,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.120
I can pay it myself.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.840
But for the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.960
bail money...

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.720
Kaiyang,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.760
the reason I,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.680
your second uncle, and aunt

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.320
asked you out today is

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.120
to make things clear

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.360
to avoid

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.520
any misunderstandings.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.640
Okay?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.320
I recall you didn't finish

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.880
college, right?

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.840
Now

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.480
you're back in China,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and as your elders,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.320
we can't just not help.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.240
Yeah.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.680
If you want a factory job,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.400
just say the word,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.840
we'll get you

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840
a decent position.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.880
Absolutely.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.840
The pay isn't great,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.160
but it's enough to live on.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.760
No, I mean, I...

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.920
For the money

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.000
for my parents...

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.320
I hope you all can...

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.920
[Okay, okay.]

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920
[Let me put it straight,]

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.360
[he is too soft-spoken]

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.800
[and too embarrassed]

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.680
[to turn you down.]

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.040
[About your dad,]

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.360
[us siblings]

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.480
[don't not]

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.000
[want to help,]

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.720
but we can't.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.760
Kaiyang, let me be frank.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.680
I have zero

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.000
cash flow.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.600
My zipper factory

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.440
has been struggling these past few years.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.159
Last year, I had to bite the bullet

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.960
and upgrade

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.800
the machinery.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.880
And now I'm

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.840
in debt up to my ears.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.600
Last quarter,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.080
I supplied a batch to

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.280
your dad's company.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.280
Still haven't been paid.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.159
Looks like that money's...

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.480
Well, we're family.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.440
Let's not get into it.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.120
Payments were always settled on delivery.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.720
And for the machinery upgrade,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.080
didn't my dad front you the money?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.440
I need money to run my factory.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.760
That money from your dad

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.840
wasn't even that much.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.360
Kaiyang,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.680
you've been abroad for years.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.040
You don't get

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.720
how things are done here.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.640
Your father and us,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.680
we're done with business.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.200
Yeah.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.080
If there's any

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.240
dealings at all,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.040
they have nothing to do

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.200
with our family ties.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.520
Business stuff

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.320
is handled by the staff.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.200
Your dad drifting apart

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.080
from the three of us,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.520
there was a reason for that.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.120
You're still young.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.800
There are things you don't know.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.920
Back then,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.560
your grandpa

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.320
left his entire inheritance

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.400
to your dad alone.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.520
The three of us?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.040
We had to build everything from the ground up.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.400
I shouldn't really

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.960
tell you this, but

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.800
your dad,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.560
he's just

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.520
a real piece of work.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.720
He never treated us like his own flesh and blood.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.120
Other older brothers

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.080
would do anything

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.000
to help their younger brothers and sisters

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.240
get ahead.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.080
But your dad?

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.960
Even at his peak,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.120
we never saw

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.920
any of the benefits.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.360
But my dad lent you money.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.040
When you first

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.720
went into raw materials,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.080
your shipment was lost.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.040
You were about to mortgage your house.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.280
My dad bailed you out, didn't he?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.280
Yeah.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.560
Yeah, he did.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.720
But he charged me

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.720
2% monthly interest.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.000
Even higher than

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.320
a bank mortgage!

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.480
And I should thank him for

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.040
not letting me

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.560
mortgage the house?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.960
But if I had

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.960
mortgaged the house,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.360
don't you think

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.000
I would've pulled through?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.440
Besides,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.320
I repaid the principal

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.560
and interest

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.920
in less than a year.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.120
How can you hold a grudge

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.600
over something so small for 20 years?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.360
Why can't you just get over it?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.520
20 years!

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.720
And we're supposed to be brothers!

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.600
Hey.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.680
Alright, calm down.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.400
You always lose it whenever money is brought up.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.520
Have some water.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.400
We're family. We should be getting along.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.120
Kaiyang.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920
I don't want to bad-mouth your dad,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.680
but what he did,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.560
it just wasn't right.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.920
Guys, calm down.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.480
Let's eat.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.200
Let's eat. Hey,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.240
brother, you haven't

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.400
touched these dishes.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.799
I'll ask them to reheat it.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.000
Don't bother.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.039
Kaiyang,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.800
sorry for

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.840
losing my temper.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.560
To put it plainly,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.200
you know what

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.240
business families are like.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.520
It's all for show.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.640
What your dad did this time,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.920
it's just too big.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.480
Blame us if you want.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.720
We honestly can't help.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.240
Please don't hate us for it.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.600
Okay, okay.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.720
Family's family, let's drop it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.880
On behalf

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.880
of my father,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.240
I apologize to

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.880
you all,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.160
sorry, I'll drink this as an apology.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.760
You don't have to down it like that.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.600
You don't have to do this.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.240
Kaiyang.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.440
Where are you going?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.240
Wait, don't go.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.120
Come on, sit down.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.880
Don't go.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.920
Kaiyang.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.400
Sir, have you finished your meal?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.280
Yes.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.160
Could you please

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.280
give me your license plate number?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.760
I'll have someone

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.840
bring your car around.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.880
Did you see me drive here?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.920
My apologies.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.760
Shall I call you

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.640
a ride instead?

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.320
No need.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.000
Kaiyang.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.160
wait!

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.760
Come here.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.160
Come.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.640
Come on.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.240
Here, take this.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080
Take it.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.840
Put it away.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.000
Listen,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.280
Grandma doesn't have a pension.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.520
She lives on

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.840
the money Grandpa left her.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.560
Not much.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.680
Be sensible.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.160
Don't just live off

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400
Grandma's money,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.080
okay?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.080
Don't be a fool.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.640
I have my pride, you know.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.560
Keep it. I'm leaving.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.920
Come here, Happy.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.000
You've got diabetes,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.600
shouldn't eat this.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.320
Have you seen a doctor?

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.680
Got checked up?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.840
Since when do you talk so much?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.360
Got any more of that batter?

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.120
Weren't you having

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.240
a fancy dinner with them?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.320
Just pretend I'm going through a growth spurt

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.160
and I'm starving, okay?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.280
It's in the pot, serve yourself.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.840
Did you

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.920
pull the plug on the landline?

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.640
I didn't.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.400
Aunt said she wanted to visit

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.520
but couldn't get through.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.000
So she couldn't come.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.640
If she really wanted to visit,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.280
she could come even without a call.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.480
I've got enough on my plate.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.200
I don't have time for their act.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.360
What are you so busy with?

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.400
I've got a flock of pigeons to look after,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.880
and now you on top of that.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.200
So you tell me.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.880
Whatever you say.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.920
I checked with the bank this morning.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.040
Your Canada transfer's arrived.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.280
The guy there said

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.000
withdrawals require an appointment.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.520
Made one for tomorrow morning.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.520
Since you're so busy,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.560
I'll go myself tomorrow.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800
Is it enough for the lawyer fees?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.480
Yes.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.240
If not, I've got

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560
no extra money for you.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.480
I said yes.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.360
I'll transfer the leftover to you.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.280
Use it for living expenses.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.440
Aunt asked me to give this to you.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.800
Putting on a front.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.080
No sign of him.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.880
It's so hot.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.680
Maybe he's not working today?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.840
Tell the client

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.200
I'm running late.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.520
I left some documents at the office.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.200
Kuang Dazhi!

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920
What are you doing?

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.920
What do you mean?

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.840
Don't recognize me?

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.840
Don't play dumb!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.880
Let go of me!

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.840
I'll call the police!

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.880
Stop shouting.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.960
Give me back my lawyer's fee!

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.880
What now?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.600
Where are you going?

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.240
Can't help you.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.520
I'm not taking on any Canadian clients.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.240
What?

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:52.920
Don't push me.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.440
Let go! Let go!

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.920
I said don't push me.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.680
Don't make me

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.160
cause a scene in front of all these people.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.400
Let go, will you?

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.160
Don't push me!

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.000
Wait...

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.840
You bastard!

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.960
I'm gone for a few days on a business trip

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.120
and you're already with someone else?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.520
You broke up with me!

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.680
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.320
What's wrong?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.560
Aren't you ashamed?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.760
Give me back the fee.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.600
Will you or not?

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.800
Everyone, look at this guy!

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.960
What a scumbag!

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.840
Show your face.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.720
He even hit me!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.600
This is domestic abuse!

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.720
Post this online!

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.560
What are you doing?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.160
Calling the police.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.320
Fine! Let's settle this

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.640
at the station.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.080
You're unbelievable.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.200
Scumbag!

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.880
Look at this jerk!

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.600
Fine, let's go.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:45.920
Yeah.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.880
Bye, we're leaving.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.360
Just a reminder.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.200
Yes, officer?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.920
As overseas Chinese, you should

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.800
respect and abide by our laws.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.680
Yes, yes.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.960
And a man must take responsibility.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.000
Debts must be repaid.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.960
That's only right, isn't it?

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.200
Causing a scene at the police station,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:16:59.680
how embarrassing.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.360
Absolutely right.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.920
Officer, your advice is spot-on.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.359
I've been on the straight

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.200
and narrow all my life,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.400
never thought I'd mess up

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.359
over such a trifle.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.599
Total mistake.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.280
I'll definitely refund the fee.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.560
Definitely.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.079
Now's the time.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.000
Yes, now. Here.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.720
Scan me.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:26.960
Got it?

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.440
Yeah.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:27.960
Good.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960
Thank you, officer.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.200
Learn from your mistakes.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.440
Stay away from jerks.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.320
Don't fall for it again.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.800
Will do, thanks for your time.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.120
Hear that?

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.760
What the officer said

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.640
was so on point.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.680
Learn from your mistakes.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.120
If not for this incident,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.000
Stop babbling.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.760
how could you improve?

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.400
Wait.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.280
What now?

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.280
You have to help me

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.720
explain to the Canadian side

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.800
that I was wrongfully accused

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.680
so I can go back to Canada.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.760
Miss, you're too naive.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.640
You broke the law.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.240
You definitely can't go back.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.600
I lied to you before.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.200
But in this situation,

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.560
I have no reason to lie anymore.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.360
Fine, Mr. Kuang.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.360
Not going to help?

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.840
One report from me,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.000
and your Canadian

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.120
law license is gone.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.920
Let's just talk rationally.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.960
Stop threatening me,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.680
alright?

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.400
Didn't I refund

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.600
your lawyer fees?

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.920
Put that phone away.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.560
Stop.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.560
Don't touch me!

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.080
Get off.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.880
Okay, okay!

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.560
Let's talk this through, okay?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.080
You really can't go back.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.280
How about this.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.920
I'll try to

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.560
refund your guarantee fee.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760
Will you believe me then?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.280
Don't you

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.480
get that

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.880
this is shady?

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.640
Getting your money back

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.040
is cutting your losses.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.840
Miss Lu,

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.360
you should

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.360
make plans here in China.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.480
What do you think?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:00.880
Send it.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.760
Bad luck.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.560
Ran into a nutcase.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.480
Gotta pay her some emotional damages.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.600
Watch your mouth.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.600
Listen,

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.960
my life is a mess right now

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.400
all because of you.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.240
I can't even go back to Canada.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.200
You seem quite good.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.360
What's your problem?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440
No offense.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.640
Take care.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.800
See you.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640
What now?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.440
Is Ge Kaiyang

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.760
on it with you?

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.520
Ge Kaiyang.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.760
Who's that?

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.600
Never mind, you can go.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.000
Bye.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.880
So this is the rich kid

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.040
who scammed you?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.760
I think he's just

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.040
posing as a rich kid

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.120
to scam people.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.680
Also,

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.160
he's not very bright.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.000
He was definitely used

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.720
by that lawyer.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.040
He said he's from Lucheng City.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.200
Keep an eye out for him.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.560
If you see him,

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.840
tackle him right away.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.880
Contact me immediately.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.600
How could you trust a scammer like that?

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.960
He's definitely not from Lucheng City.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.160
And why are you still keeping his photo?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.200
Just delete it.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.960
I can't delete it. No way.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.560
You can't let go of him, is that it?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.400
What are you talking about?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.360
It's evidence, okay?

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.040
[I'm keeping it to settle the score]

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.200
[and show the police.]

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.840
Oh, evidence, huh?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.280
Don't listen, don't look.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.320
You're ridiculous.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.360
Hey, are you sure

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.520
you want to stay here tonight?

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.000
Come crash at my place.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.880
That is just too much.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.320
You'll never sleep.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.760
If I go to your place,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.120
your mom will call my mom

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.880
800 times a day.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.160
What if she slips up?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.560
I'll just

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.160
tell her.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.280
Give her a heads-up.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.560
Don't laugh.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.360
Hurry, hurry,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.640
my mom's video-calling.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.280
Come on.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:32.920
Where am I supposed to go?

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.000
Go over there and stay put.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.120
Mom.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.360
Xinying,

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.880
why didn't you pick up?

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.360
My phone

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.920
was on silent.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.920
I didn't hear it.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.320
So here's the thing.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520
I met someone

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.960
in the Chinese community

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.240
in Canada.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.320
This woman

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:08.960
is loaded.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.480
[Their situation]

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480
[is like this:]

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.520
[she travels all the time on business,]

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.440
[and]

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.720
[they've got a big dog at home.]

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:15.880
A golden retriever,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.080
super sweet,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.040
very gentle.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.240
And I was thinking,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.040
maybe you could

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.560
help her walk the dog sometimes,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.960
feed it and all that.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.600
You know, over time,

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.120
you build a relationship.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:28.920
[You get what I mean?]

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.600
Mom,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.840
I'm already exhausted from work.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.080
You're trying to burn me out

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.400
walking somebody else's dog?

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.640
Just treat it like exercise.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.040
Get up a bit earlier.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240
Listen, Xinying,

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.320
you need to spend time with people

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.760
who are better off than you.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.000
That's how you

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.680
improve yourself.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.960
But

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.040
think about it:

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.480
if I

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.960
take her dog out

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.600
and nothing happens, fine.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.200
But if it gets bumped

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.000
or hurt somehow,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.960
then that connection is gone,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.560
right? Forget it.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.120
Well...

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.000
that's not totally wrong.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.400
But it's not that dramatic either.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.840
[It's just walking a dog.]

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.080
[It'll be fine.]

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.560
[I'm telling you,]

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.600
[this woman]

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.720
[has wide connections in Canada.]

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.480
Sometimes

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.600
I regret not taking you

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.440
to Canada earlier.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.480
Then we wouldn't be

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.920
so short on contacts now.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.880
Your network

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.360
is your lifetime wealth.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.800
Mom,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.520
what kind of network

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.120
are you getting from walking her dog?

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.000
[You never know.]

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.040
You really can't predict it.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.520
One day you might need that connection.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.800
And she's definitely better than

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.240
[that Li Manfei, right?]

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.440
[Think about it,]

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.360
[what can she do for you?]

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:46.880
Mom.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.560
[At most you buy her]

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.080
Mom.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.120
[a Canada Goose coat.]

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.200
[She and her mom are exactly the same.]

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.280
[You can see]

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.960
[their whole life at a glance.]

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.040
I'm...

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.720
I'm hanging up now, okay?

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.600
Talk later.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.080
Manfei, Manfei.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.040
I'm so sorry,

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.280
my mom's out of her mind.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.080
She really doesn't know how to talk.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.160
Please don't be mad.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.800
It's fine,

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.960
I'm not mad.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.040
She's not wrong, either.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.280
I'm just worried about you.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.680
If you keep making things up like this,

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.520
one day you won't be able to keep it up.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.560
What else can I do?

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.120
I'll drag it out one day at a time.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.080
What about your life, though?

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.960
You can't

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.920
stay here forever.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.120
Maybe

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.160
start by finding a job?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.480
Just help me keep this secret for now.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.280
[I'll look for work.]

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.600
Your resume looks great,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.000
[but with expectations]

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.040
like yours,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.360
I'm afraid we can't meet your demands.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.000
[You know how the job market]

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.160
[and the economy are right now.]

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.240
[Landing a position]

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.320
[at a company of our size]

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720
[is already pretty good.]

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.240
I know.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.600
That's why your company

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.720
is my first choice.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.000
And I get

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.280
that overseas degrees

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.520
aren't that special anymore.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.080
That's why I kept my salary expectations

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.640
pretty reasonable,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.280
right?

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.560
Living costs

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.160
are high.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.400
I still have to rent a place,

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.280
right?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.960
I feel like what I'm asking

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.440
is just average.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.760
Aren't you a local here?

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.360
Why would you need to rent?

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.240
Shouldn't

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.200
my salary

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.480
be based on

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.880
my skills?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.080
What does being local or

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.640
owning an apartment have to do with it?

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.240
[Don't come out.]

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.280
[It's pouring out here.]

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.360
[All right, I've got something to do,]

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.280
[I'll talk to you later. Bye.]

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:39.840
[Sorry about that.]

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.440
[I had to grab that call.]

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.080
Last four

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.040
digits 5151, right?

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.920
Please fasten your seat belt.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.760
We're heading out.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.240
This rain is insane.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.600
[There are tissues in the back.]

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.040
[I'm counting.]

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.000
[Ten,]

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.960
[nine,]

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:26.920
[eight,]

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.160
[seven,]

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.720
six,

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.920
five, four, three, two, one.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.200
Ready or not?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.560
Getting smarter this time, huh?

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.800
Not answering me.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.200
Even if you don't answer,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.360
I still know where you're hiding.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.920
Lu Xinying?

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.200
This time you hid too well.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.480
I really can't find you.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.400
Who's this?

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.680
Where could she be?

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.520
This one?

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.920
Even Dad can't find you,

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.800
so I guess I have to give up.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.440
Where did you go, huh?

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:14.920
Xinying?

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.640
Daddy,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.240
I caught you!

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.160
You caught me.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.600
You're amazing.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.960
You even know how to set a trap now,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.800
huh?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.240
You're so clever.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.160
Okay, next round.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.400
What do we play?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.680
Let's play again.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:37.960
Again?

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.560
Need to switch turns?

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.960
You've reached your destination.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.680
Please remember to...

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.840
[What is it, sweetheart?]

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.080
[Texting this early?]

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.840
[You get up early.]

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:22.960
[Got it,]

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.560
Dad knows what you're hinting at.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.800
About renting the car

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.720
like you mentioned last time,

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.280
no problem.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:29.720
[Next month]

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.560
[I'll transfer you]

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.200
[a bit extra.]

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.360
[But]

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.520
[we can't tell your mom]

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.480
[about this yet, okay?]

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.600
What's this thing?

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.120
[Hello?]

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.040
Dad.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.840
[Where are you?]

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.200
I

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.640
just woke up.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.840
I'm about to head out.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.400
[I just picked up a resume.]

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.400
[This girl,]

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.480
[her age, name, education,]

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.480
[all exactly the same as yours.]

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.840
[Even the work experience]

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.600
[in Canada is identical.]

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.320
[Isn't that something?]

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.120
[Let's video call.]

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.920
[Tell me where you are, I'll come.]

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.400
I'll send you my location.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:20.800
Dad.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.560
I thought the next time we saw each other

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.760
would be in Toronto.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.520
Are you going to let me in?

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.520
This is your Toronto?

00:32:59.200 --> 00:32:59.800
Tell me.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.000
How long have you been back?

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.680
Already out job hunting.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.320
Be honest with me.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.280
What's really going on?

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.440
I promise I won't lose my temper.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.920
Come on, tell me...

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.720
Dad, what are you doing?

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:39.720
Dad!

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.520
Open the door!

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.720
Open up!

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.840
- Dad!
- Open up!

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.800
What are you doing?

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:50.840
Who are you,

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.240
old man?

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:51.920
Why are you pounding on my door?

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.680
You crazy or what?

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.440
Watch your mouth.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.360
Dad!

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.080
He hit me!

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.080
Does it hurt?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.960
I'm fine.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.440
Look at you,

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.760
actually getting into a fight.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.280
Good thing they were willing

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.600
to settle at the station.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:22.760
I haven't even started on you yet

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.320
and you're already lecturing me.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.480
No, not this one.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.239
Too flashy. That's for kids.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.520
No.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.280
Let it breathe, it'll heal faster.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.199
It's pouring outside.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.320
If it gets wet, it'll get infected.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.600
Come on, stick it on.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.320
Stick it on.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.280
Just one.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.000
There.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.000
This is for little kids.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.120
The year when you went to Canada,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.160
you were about this tall.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.080
[I took you]

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.720
and your mom to the airport.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.760
After baggage check-in,

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.320
you still

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.120
had that huge backpack on,

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.720
bigger than you were.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.120
Big suitcase in your left hand,

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.520
another bag in your right,

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.040
swaying along.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.400
We said goodbye three, four times

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:24.920
and you still wouldn't leave.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.320
I told your mom,

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.880
"You have to go through security."

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.760
I watched you two walk in.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.120
Two steps,

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.800
then you turned and looked back at me.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.800
Two more steps,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.080
look back again.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.400
That scene,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.040
it's still

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.640
right here in front of my eyes.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.800
You lied to me.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.760
You said

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.920
you'd come to Canada

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.720
every Chinese New Year.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.560
But you missed my high school graduation,

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.800
and my college graduation too.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.480
Do you know how expensive

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.160
those round-trip tickets are?

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.880
There are better ways to use that money.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.720
Besides, you and your mom

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.440
were in Canada,

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.760
you got expenses to cover.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.120
Dad, that day,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.600
[when I saw you,]

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.360
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.280
You had so much white hair.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.560
Every time we video call,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.080
you switch it to voice

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.960
and won't turn the camera on.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.200
I barely recognized your face anymore.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.560
Don't cry, Dad.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:05.960
Why

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.600
are you driving ride-hail now?

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.760
Want something to eat?

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.560
I'll grab us a snack.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.080
Come on,

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.520
just grab something.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.920
I never would've guessed

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.360
that after more than ten years,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.560
our first reunion would be

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.160
over convenience-store oden.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.320
Dad,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.200
I

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.040
lost that bank job

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.160
in Canada.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.600
It's okay.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.680
I lost my job too, didn't I?

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.040
But you came back

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.320
without a word,

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.680
stayed in some budget hotel.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.640
Why sneak back like that?

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.320
I didn't love that place.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.520
Do you have any idea

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.280
how hard your mom and I worked

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.440
to send you there to study?

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.120
We practically worked ourselves to death.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.120
Dad...

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.520
And

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.840
you were there

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.560
all those years.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.800
You even bought a place.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.240
Then you just say "I don't like it"

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.240
and run back?

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.840
Don't you think that's a bit rash?

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.800
[It's not rash.]

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:45.880
[Staying in Canada]

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.440
[comes down to a lottery. Pure luck,]

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.640
[not effort.]

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.320
[I want a life where]

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.360
[hard work actually leads to something.]

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.680
Dad, you say you understand me,

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.440
but you've never

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.640
really let me make a decision.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.240
Just this once,

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:01.640
can you?

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.720
Let me stay here in China,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.440
and you go convince Mom.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.600
Please?

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.080
I get it. I really do.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.520
[But]

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.480
talking to your mom about this...

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.400
That's going to be tough.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.160
[You see,]

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.440
[it's]

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.960
[not that simple.]

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.280
Once you let

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.280
the arrow fly,

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.440
there's no taking it back.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.120
I don't want to be the arrow anymore.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.960
Why can't I be the one

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.280
holding the bow?

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:39.920
[What if,]

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.080
[after a while,]

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.800
you just

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.840
get used to it there?

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.920
Dad, it's been ten years.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.840
If I could adapt, I would've by now.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.240
Okay, I hear you.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.000
What about

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.480
your work visa renewal?

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.480
I hired a lawyer.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.520
A third party is handling it now.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.560
All right.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.040
How long

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.920
have you been driving?

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.560
Not long.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.400
Half a year...

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.040
A bit more.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.400
[It's fine.]

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.280
Dad,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.960
you've had a hard time too.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.000
Hard?

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:54.880
We understand each other.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.280
That's what matters.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.200
But this stays

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.240
between us.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.600
Your mom can't know yet.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.240
[I'll think about]

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.560
[how to slowly]

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.520
[get it across to her,]

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.120
[ease her into it.]

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.600
[In that moment,]

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.760
[I wanted to tell him everything.]

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.160
[But looking into his eyes,]

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.520
[the words just wouldn't come out.]

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.360
[So]

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.920
[I put all the refunded lawyer fees]

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.600
[and guarantor money]

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.640
[onto a separate bank card,]

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.520
[and no matter how hard things get,]

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.800
[I won't touch a cent of it.]

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.880
[I decided from now on]

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.440
[I'm going to be the one holding the bow.]

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.320
[Earn my own living,]

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.760
[carry my own weight,]

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.520
[stop being a burden to my parents,]

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.400
[find a job,]

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.160
[and take charge of my own future.]

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.280
[Zhaocai, why didn't you]

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.840
[go out and fly again today?]

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.960
[You can't just sit at home like this,]

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.880
[you'll be useless before long.]

00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.560
[Look

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.080
look how fat you've gotten.]

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.560
All right, all right.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.760
Even a bird

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.280
knows it has to go out

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.040
and find its own food.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.560
Some people

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.200
aren't even as good as a bird.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.760
You're too old to be cursing.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:19.880
So you're not asleep.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.680
I'll pay you for my living expenses.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.680
[It's not about money.]

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.000
[You need to get out and work.]

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:31.960
[I dropped out halfway,]

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.160
I don't even have a degree.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.040
Who's going to hire me?

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.560
Plenty of people never graduated.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.400
Are they all just lying at home

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.240
waiting to be fed?

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.720
Why are you so mean?

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.960
Did my dad pick that up from you?

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.760
If you're alive, you should work.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.200
My pigeons

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.360
have food and water,

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.520
but they still have to go out and fly.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.040
Eating, drinking, pooping and loafing,

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880
is that even living?

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:14.920
[Alive,]

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.200
[sitting up here on the rooftop,]

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:18.920
[surrounded by pigeons]

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.600
[that work harder than I do.]

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.600
[What a joke.]

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.120
[I never wanted to admit it,]

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.520
[but I probably can't get rid of]

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.880
[the "rich second gen" label.]

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.400
[Living off my parents' money,]

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.680
[never thinking about]

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.840
[taking responsibility for myself.]

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.240
[And now]

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.280
[I realize I have nothing of my own.]

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.240
[Yeah,]

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.360
[I lie around every day.]

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.400
[Does that count as living?]

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.960
[I've been running away,]

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:47.800
[from responsibility,]

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.520
[from the future.]

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.040
[It's time to wake up]

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.320
[and face it.]

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.360
I'm almost there.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.240
[Falling from the heights]

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.000
[showed me what real life looks like.]

00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.880
One second, please.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.120
[All the fake halo is gone.]

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:02.960
Sorry about that.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.720
[I'm starting to see]

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.320
[that only I]

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.840
[can give my life meaning.]

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.400
[Maybe]

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.400
[it's time to stand up]

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.880
[and face the world.]

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.160
[When I do stage plays,]

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.720
[I can never write]

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.760
[dialogue this good.]

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.440
Hello, Ms. Zhou?

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.200
Give me ten minutes.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:57.920
Okay.
