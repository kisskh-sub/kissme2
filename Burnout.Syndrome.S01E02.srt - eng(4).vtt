Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.600
There’s a place I know.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.980
It’s called Burnout Bar.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.130
Sounds like I’ll be in a worse place
if I go there.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.930
It’s a good place for people
who are burnt out.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.020
Your palm says you’re going to
get a new job soon.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.050
What’s your name?

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.750
Am I in a job interview?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Yes.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.210
If I like your answers,
you’ll get the job.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.230
You got the job.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.400
Leave me your contact.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.900
I’ll get in touch when I need you to work.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.000
I take the job.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.300
Mr. K.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.150
Hello.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.300
Can you see me?

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.600
I can.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.240
Excuse me for not turning
on my camera today.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.400
It’s alright.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.600
You can take your time until you’re ready.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.060
How is your insomnia?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.890
Is it better?

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.900
It’s the same.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.980
Can’t you give me a heavier dose?

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.980
Of course.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.900
I can talk to the psychiatry department.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.300
But before we jump ahead to that,
I suggest you increase your exercise time,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.500
and we can talk about
upping your dose later.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.200
Of course.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.400
I’ll try swimming.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.600
How was the restaurant experience?

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.829
Did you apply any of the skills
we mentioned last time?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.300
I made sure to choose a restaurant
with less crowd.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.250
But there was still the issue of security.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.900
So I thought I’d make an appointment
at one restaurant,

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.700
and then go to a different one,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.100
and send a car to pick them up.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.570
Mr. K, wouldn’t that be
adding more to the issue

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.840
of making yourself
the center of the problem?

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.900
Most of the time, we cannot change people,
but we can change ourselves.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.000
There is this theory of
the freedom to choose.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.450
You can choose to do whatever you want

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.750
and take its consequences.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.600
That means freedom doesn’t mean
you can do anything.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.150
It means you can do something
whose consequences you’re willing to take.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.760
This thing we’re talking about,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.250
do you think you can apply it
to meeting people?

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.350
I don’t meet people much.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.900
But if I can’t avoid it,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.500
I think I just found myself
a short-term solution to it.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.050
I met someone.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200
Who is it, Mr. K?

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.240
Hmm!

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.450
It’s very basil-y!

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.000
Okay. Cut.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.990
That was good. But let’s get
another take just in case.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.100
Can we make it over the top this time?

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.000
Alright?

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.000
Camera.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.200
Ready. In three, two, one.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.900
Action.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.390
Hmm!

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.600
It’s very basil-y!

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.950
Cut.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.800
Got it.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.980
What’s with you?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.100
Hey.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.650
I need your help.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.650
It’s an emergency.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.800
What?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.400
So he just walked around naked in his room
while you were still there?

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.800
What was he thinking?

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.800
Isn’t that weird?

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.300
It is.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.250
You know why he said
I passed the interview?

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.150
He said he didn’t feel a thing
staring at my face.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.770
I guess the walking-around-naked
is just a normal thing guys do?

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.750
So?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.950
You saw him naked…

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.400
and now you want him?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.000
Is that why you want to work with him?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.700
Ugh!

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.900
You out of your mind?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.000
It’s only because it pays well.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.000
Careful.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.300
Rich and mysterious…

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.300
He could be a mafia.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.570
What if next thing you know
you were shipped to the border,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.750
being forced to scam people?

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.450
I can’t save you, I’ll have you know.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.800
That’s exactly
why I’m here talking to you.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.200
Oh?

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.670
What?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.350
He’s just sent me a response.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.430
What should I do?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.730
Speaking of the devil…

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.170
Do you remember anything at all?

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.850
Think again.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.850
Maybe there’s a lead somewhere
about who he is.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.050
To tell you the truth,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.250
I can’t think of anything.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.750
I only saw his dong, you know?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.000
I knew it.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.200
Mr. K, from our conversations
in the previous sessions,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.800
I’m quite surprised you opened up to him.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.670
What made you trust him?

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.530
I wouldn’t say I trust him.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.730
But he’s not a complex person.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.850
He speaks his mind.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.500
I just think he’s easy to read.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.450
I’m reading through his social media.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.150
He posts everything he thinks.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.200
It’s almost like a diary, really.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.650
“Expert mastery is required,
but then the salary is entry level.”

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.370
“What the fuck, jerks?”

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.429
He’s money-hungry.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.150
It’s easy when they can be controlled
with money.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.799
Hello.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.750
Hello.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.400
Mr. Jira, is it?

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.030
Yes.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.050
I’m Mr. Koh’s butler.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.050
Please come this way.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.650
One more thing,

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.800
he’s not in my industry at all.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.170
I think he doesn’t know and likely
doesn't have what it takes to hurt me.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.250
Mr. Butler.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.000
What is Mr. Koh’s full name?

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.400
I am not allowed to reveal
my boss’ secrets.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.280
Before we go, I must be so impolite
as to ask to pat your down,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.400
as well as take away your phone, sir.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.300
What?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.300
I won’t leak any information
about your boss.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.450
This is Mr. Koh’s demand.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.430
Excuse me.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.030
All done.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.470
Please hand me your bag.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.600
This is the keycard
to the penthouse suite.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.850
Do you have to take away
my phone and bag?

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.770
We haven’t signed our contract.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.400
I have to be careful.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.030
Take a look at that paper.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.150
What is this?

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.960
An NDA.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.450
What’s an NDA?

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.550
It is what it says.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.700
Non-disclosure agreement.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.100
An agreement to make sure none of
my information gets disclosed.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.500
If you talk about me,

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.300
or leak anything about this,

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.930
I can sue you.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.300
What?

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.500
Sue?

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.150
It’s protocol.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.650
If we were to work together,
we need contracts.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.900
Oh, and I added an extra item.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.650
You must allow me to access
your social media and location.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.700
Are you for real?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.600
It’s for emergencies.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.950
All my employees have to sign it.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.700
Well, what does an NDA cover?

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.150
What do you mean?

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.020
Can I talk to my friends about you?

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.970
Not at all.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.850
What if someone sees us together?

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.800
What should I say?

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.950
Lie.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.250
And if I don’t agree with this?

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.700
Then you can go home right now.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.530
In the contract,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.400
there’s gotta be the name of
the employee, right?

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.130
Whose signature is this?

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.550
It’s beautiful.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.340
Yours?

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.900
No.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.800
That’s my company's legal representative.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.500
There you go.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.450
Since I’m in your employment now,

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.260
can I ask you something, Boss?

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.710
What is it?

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.830
Nothing much.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.400
If you ask me to do something
I don’t feel like doing,

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.930
I’m reserving my right to send in
my resignation notice.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.140
Noted.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.990
But not promised.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.350
When he goes to the toilet or whatever,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.900
just look through his stuff.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.650
His wallet and his desk and such.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.700
There’s gotta be something
that tells you who he is.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.500
Hello.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.850
You saw him, didn’t you?

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.530
What I’m offering is an opportunity.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.230
In our sector, we’ve always been examined
and scrutinized, haven’t we?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.050
The cool thing about what I’m about
to offer is tech.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.400
It’s new.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.500
And because it’s new,
no law’s been written about it yet.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.200
A guy in tech like him,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:42.550
there’s gotta be at least a trophy
or certificate of some kind.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:59.750
And since it’s a startup,
we don’t need a lot of resources.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.200
You don’t have to worry about
your investment.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.370
I’ll launder it fast and good,
like dry cleaning.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.960
The return of investment will definitely
be higher than last time.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.900
What do you say?

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.500
This might bother you a little, Mr. Jira,

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.000
but before you leave this place,

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.900
you will be patted down again
to make sure nothing gets taken.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:19.730
Hello.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.700
Hey.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.010
The investors are on board.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.900
For real?

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.550
You’re really something.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.250
We’ll handle the money like usual.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.030
But the investors want us to cut costs
in the year-end production.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.300
We need to lay some people off
this quarter.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.300
How many people?

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.350
Your whole department.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.100
Who’s telling my team this?

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.400
You are.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:11.960
Turn around.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.750
What is this for?

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.950
Tailoring.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800
Your shoulders are small.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:25.900
Well, I tried.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.900
It’s alright.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.200
I’ll make them look wider.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.450
So what exactly am I here to do?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.550
You’re going to be Mr. K.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.350
Mr. K?

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.030
What’s that?

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.100
Me.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.600
Koh.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.300
So you want me to be you?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.030
Yeah.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.750
I want you to represent me
in my business negotiation.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.200
Why don’t you do it yourself?

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:03.970
I hate meeting people.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.400
Too much drama.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.550
Too much chaos.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:07.970
Is that so?

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.470
I count as people, you know?

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.850
And you’re fine meeting me.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.650
If you’re gonna mess with me,
we might as well just call this off.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.170
Well, my bad.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.750
Ugh.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.130
I’m sorry, then.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.010
All done.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.010
Mr. Butler.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.230
Can you find a suit that’s perfect for
a sweet-looking guy who works in fashion?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.250
I just sent you the measurements.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.200
I need it by 4 o’clock.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.650
Now we’ll try to imitate me.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.900
I’m taking over your company.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.150
What?

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.150
Repeat after me.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.020
I need a seat at the board.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.170
With this number, I believe it’s not
too much trouble—

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.940
Hold on, hold on.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.600
Hold on.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.450
What’s the context here?

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.450
I literally don’t know anything.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.400
You said you’re an actor.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.770
Hey, an actor needs to know the character
and their background.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.070
I don’t know what kind of man you are.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.350
I can’t play.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.570
It’s so obvious and you need more context?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.670
It’s a business negotiation.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.550
Try the same line. Again.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.700
I’m taking over your company.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.240
Is repeating after me too much of a feat?

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.600
It’s acting.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.650
I’m not a robot you can just key
the information in and ready to go.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.610
I need emotions and feelings.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.740
Alright.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.750
I’ll make you play Jira.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.020
Be yourself.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.030
Whichever interview you walk in,

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.050
you already know,

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.250
they’re going to turn you down.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.700
The interviews are just formality.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.100
In the end, you burst out.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.300
You get the situation?

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.100
Being yourself

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.450
is not too difficult for you, is it?

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.600
Let’s begin, shall we?

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.900
I understand.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.500
I’m used to it.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.500
You won’t give me the job.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.720
I understand…

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.020
-You were picking me apart
-I’m used to it.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.580
-from the moment I walked into the room,
-I know you won’t give me the job.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.010
pointing out my flaws.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.400
You were pickling me apart

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.200
from the moment I walked into the room,

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.400
pointing out my flaws.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.050
Repeat after me faster.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.850
What should I get up early in the morning
and get dressed for?

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.820
What should I get up early in the morning
and get dressed for?

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.300
For a few people to decide
my future for me?

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.130
For a few people to decide
my future for me?

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.800
To work myself to death for a few grands?

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.600
-To work myself to death for a few grands?
-If I could choose,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.600
I wouldn’t be begging you for this job.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.900
If I could choose,

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.500
-I wouldn’t be begging you for this job.
-And when I get the job,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.700
I have to worry
I’d be laid off any minute.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.700
-And when I get the job,
-Taking your frustration out on me.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.940
I have to worry
I’d be laid off any minute.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.470
I’d feel like an emotional dustbin
for the likes of you.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.400
Taking your frustration out on me.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.300
I’d feel like an emotional dustbin
for the likes of you.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:46.500
It seems you got it.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.020
How do you feel?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.500
I…

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.550
I just…

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.500
I feel like…

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.850
I feel like I don’t belong anywhere.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.550
I’m not good at anything.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.300
What I want to know is

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.250
how good do I have to be to be chosen?

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.600
I’m choosing you.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.300
Did…

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.050
Did you look through my social media?

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.930
You’re a jerk.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:43.800
Yeah.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:48.850
You did well.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.550
But no drama for this job.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.470
I have no use for your tears.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:11.750
I drink plum wine when I’m stressed.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.350
I make this myself, you know?

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.850
Drink it.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.600
It’ll help you focus on the task at hand.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.800
Guys.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.600
I have an announcement to make.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.600
Happy birthday to you.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.210
Happy birthday to you.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.960
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:22.510
Happy birthday to you.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.950
Hey.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.600
Happy birthday, buddy.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.150
What’s wrong?

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:57.530
Frowning on your birthday…

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.890
You don’t like surprises?

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:01.600
It’s not that.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.970
I have something to tell you.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.400
Don’t tell anyone yet.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.650
I don’t want everyone to freak out.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:16.600
Fire away.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.700
Our company is restructuring.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.500
Restructuring, that means…

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.750
That means we’re reorganzing.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.150
Do you remember that two years ago,

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.350
Hive had the production
and design departments?

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.630
Koh restructured the company,

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.530
and now we outsourced.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.150
Last year, he restructured
the marketing team,

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.650
and replaced them with algorithms.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:54.750
This year,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.180
he’s restructuring
the application development team.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.050
He’s replacing us with
the AI we developed.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.400
We need less people.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.000
Are you telling me

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.700
I did all that coding only
to get rid of myself?

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.300
Those are such pretty words
just to fire people, ain’t they?

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.670
Honestly, aren’t you friends with him?

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.130
Why do you keep letting him do
whatever he wants?

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.630
What can I do?

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:41.570
Shit.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.430
If I’m getting fired anyway,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.870
can you let me see him for like once?

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.140
I just need one shot at the jerk!

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.020
Calm down.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.270
There’s nothing you can do now
even if you see him.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.020
I think you need to think about
what you’re gonna do to get through this.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.500
What’s your plan?

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.250
Damn it.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.200
When I got the job here,

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.970
you people made me sign
a non-competition agreement.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.450
I can’t ask you to start
a company together.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.560
I can’t use my own coding elsewhere.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.350
Fuck that!

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.700
How about this?

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.020
Start saving up your money.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.700
And…

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.400
You can stay at my place
for the time being.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:47.670
Yeah.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.350
I’ll count on that.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.030
And I won’t help you pay a damn baht.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.570
I spent all my money on your damn cake.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.000
Oh, fuck.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.020
You ready to work?

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.250
The suit is here.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.170
Sure.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.020
The situation isn’t complicated today.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.150
You’re a nominee.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:17.250
Your job is to make sure the partner
we’re meeting today feels at ease,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.550
and takes our investment.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:24.620
Why don’t you hire some lawyer to do this,
or an actual businessman?

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:25.700
Why me?

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.700
I sent all those.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.000
He always resisted.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:36.300
I guess those people I sent don’t know
much about fashion, unlike you.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.450
I believe you can do it.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.100
Who’s this partner we’re meeting?

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.470
Library.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.430
Thames’.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:43.870
What?

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.350
I told you I worked with him before.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.500
He knows my face.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.100
Don’t worry.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.350
Thames only sees people
who are useful to him.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.700
I’ll be honest with you.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.900
He won’t remember you.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:09.940
You done?

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.200
We’re in a hurry.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.700
Some fashionable suit this is.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:28.950
What’s this?

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.020
Give it to him when I tell you to.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.020
Stop fidgeting.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.200
Hey.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.200
What should I say to him?

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.350
Talk about art.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.400
Say something that shows your depth.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:10.850
Charm him.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.350
When his guard is down,
I’ll tell you what to say.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.250
How do I get his guard down?

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.630
A hook to the face?

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:23.900
Thames is here.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.250
Get ready.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.700
Imagine this.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.300
Let’s say you were Vermeer.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.000
You just painted something
so damn beautiful.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.270
What kind of buyer
would you like to sell it to?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.200
You know Vermeer was broke
until his very last day?

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:41.630
Yeah, whatever.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.410
What kind of people would you sell
your painting to?

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.100
Someone who sees the value
in my painting, I guess.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.750
That’s how you should make him feel.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.470
Hello, Mr. Thames.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.000
I’m K.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.290
Sorry for the sudden change of
the meeting place.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.570
Would you like something to eat?

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:10.900
No, I don’t think so.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.230
Talk to him about whatever
you find interesting.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.130
Mention his brand or something.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.250
I like your Spring collection.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.530
Thank you.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.370
When can we expect to see your next one?

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:45.500
Give him that paper.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.300
Right now.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.950
At this price, what do you want from me?

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.450
A seat at the board, with this number…

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.500
A seat at the board,

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.830
with this number,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.120
isn’t too much for you, is it?

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.820
We’ll see if we can get along
in the long run.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.100
What do you think, Mr. Thames?

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.250
I know what you’re trying to do.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.300
You can stop trying.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.900
You won’t succeed.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.800
Make him stay.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.970
Hurry up!

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:38.750
Ugh!

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.270
Sorry.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.950
Follow him.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.020
What are you doing just sitting there?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.130
What can I even say?

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.900
Just talk about your dumb art or whatever.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.550
I hired you.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.700
Can you at least showcase any sign
of intelligence so I don’t regret it?

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:57.870
Go.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.400
Go!

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:27.570
Excuse me.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.770
Do you need help?

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.730
How many companies have you done this to?

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.750
If I said yours is my first,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.850
would you believe me?

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:54.850
This suit…

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.550
It’s the DNA of your brand.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.700
1991, isn’t it?

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.650
You know that?

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.560
I wrote my thesis on you.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.540
You did?

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.450
Yes.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.230
I interviewed you myself, actually,

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.250
at your old warehouse.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.470
I guess you don’t remember me.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.000
What was your thesis about?

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.850
I was just wondering
if there’s art in fashion

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.810
since high-end brands seem to change
their designers so frequently.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.980
Their products are beautiful and
have artistic values, but don’t sell.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:49.200
Meanwhile, some brands are
lower in quality,

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.940
lacking their uniqueness,

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.950
and yet, they sell.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.150
I wasn’t sure which one of them
would get to keep their job.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.030
What was the conclusion of your thesis?

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.630
Is fashion art?

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.970
Whether it is or isn’t
isn’t the point, is it?

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.200
Don’t they all say nowadays that
good fashion is the one that sells?

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.900
Do you mean to say Library doesn’t sell
because it’s bad?

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.300
Fashion isn’t fine art.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:21.600
It’s capitalism.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.150
But to tell you the truth,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.940
I don’t think that.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.230
But if I were to join your management,

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.000
I need to be honest with you.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.610
You can go back to making clothes
the way you like.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.430
I’ll be the one bullshitting
our way through,

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.100
telling people it’s fine art.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.170
One seat only.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.300
Aren’t you going to order
something to drink?

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.400
You've been sitting here a while.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.270
I’m waiting for someone.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.370
I’ll order when he’s here.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.030
I see.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.850
I guess I don’t need to match you
with someone today, then?

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:31.600
Fine by me.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.850
How are you doing?

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.300
Did you get through that old issue?

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.200
I got a new job.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.020
But it seems I’ll be unemployed soon.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:53.700
Here.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.550
Your work is done.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:01.970
You were good.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.010
I thought you weren’t gonna pull through.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.600
Are you trying to compliment or insult me?

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:06.430
It’s a compliment.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.050
I always make sure I am worth my payroll.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.200
I get paid task-by-task.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.600
My boss is demanding and orders me around.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.770
If he hires me again,
I don’t think I’ll accept.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.050
If you want my opinion,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.850
you should stick with your job
if you have one.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.450
That’s what everyone says.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.750
What’s your plan?

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.200
Rebranding Library?

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.750
What are you gonna do with
that one seat at the board?

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.500
You don’t need to think about that.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.000
There’s no plans.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.670
We’re just taking over his company.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.330
I know that.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.800
But what are you going to do next?

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.020
Hello.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.650
Beautiful suit.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.000
Did you go to work?

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.470
It fits you nicely.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:11.950
What?

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.410
You’re taking it off?

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.130
It’s hot in here.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:19.800
I have a drink for you.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.980
“Workplace Romance.”

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.500
It’s perfect for people who are in love
with their colleague.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.970
When you did my palm reading,
you got almost everything right.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.150
I did?

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:35.400
Tell me.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.830
The hard-earned job that pays well.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.530
Classic.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.430
Well? How do you like it?

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:44.500
I don’t like it at all.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.420
If I have to go back, I’d rather eat shit.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.970
Now I wonder what kind of job it is.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.200
It’s basically scamming.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.210
I had to trick people
into making a deal with me.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:55.300
It’s awful.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:59.040
I want his archive so I can develop my AI.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.330
What do you mean?

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.150
I’ll make AI study his fashion design.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.250
I can’t keep waiting around for
those designers to have ideas, you know.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:12.500
Fashion isn’t about trendsetting.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.150
It’s all about how to best keep up
with the trends.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.600
That’s the important part.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.940
His is our country’s legendary
fashion brand.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.600
A legendary copycat is what he is.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.200
He copies the design from European brands.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:35.210
That’s exactly why I want
his archive for my AI.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.020
When we have copyright strikes, we can
just say the AI learns it from his brand.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.050
Hey.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.400
He’s got a signature and
very valuable craftsmanship.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.900
You just said it yourself that
fashion is capitalism.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.010
Don’t worry.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.100
I’ll make sure his ending
is at least elegant.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.870
How can you do this?

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.700
I’m telling him.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.510
Did you forget you signed an NDA?

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.350
You can’t take the consequences.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:09.430
I quit.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.150
You don’t get to.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.300
I’m firing you.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.020
We’re done here.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:17.750
Bye.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:32.840
Let’s change the subject.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.450
“What do you like and don’t like
about your job?”

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.350
I said all those.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:43.200
You tell me.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.250
How’s work?

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:45.650
Mine?

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.420
Well… Quite bad.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.950
I have to fire a friend.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.510
I’ve been working here a long time,

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.370
and now I’m asking myself
if I want to keep doing it.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.470
You know what the worst part is?

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.700
I don’t have the gut to quit.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.570
I’ve been working this job forever.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.000
I feel like it’s a part of who I am now.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:10.830
Quit.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.770
You gotta step out of your
safe zone sometimes, you know?

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.100
I don’t have it in me.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:15.850
You see…

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.600
My career line is not very strong.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.250
I fear I’d make things worse if I quit.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.830
But…

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.850
At least there’s something good going on.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.550
I get to meet you on my birthday,
after all.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.650
What?

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.230
Is it your birthday today?

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.000
Mhmm.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.700
Happy birthday.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.600
I don’t have anything for you, though.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:46.500
It’s alright.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.650
You didn’t know.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.250
I have an idea.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:55.450
If I make you a birthday present,

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.600
would you take it?

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.500
Alright.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.170
You ready?

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:09.450
Hold on.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.900
Give me a minute to
mentally prepare myself.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.020
I got this idea when my boss
splashed wine on our client.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.300
The wine stain looked really pretty.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.900
It kinda seemed artful.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:22.630
Would you like to see it?

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.600
I can show you.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:35.000
Hold–Hold up.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.500
Are you saying you want to
splash wine on me?

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:40.600
Is that it?

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.400
Oh… When you put it like that,
it sounds weird.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.430
I’m basically asking you
to be washed in wine.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:49.020
Right?

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:51.950
It’s not exactly weird.

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.700
It’s my birthday.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.500
I came prepared for a surprise.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:43:59.750
Alright. I’m ready.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:00.570
Okay.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.430
One.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.020
Two.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:05.200
Three.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.930
Shit.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:12.150
Sorry.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.630
I didn’t think it would turn out like this.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.000
What? Did you miss?

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.550
No. It just doesn't live up
to the expectations.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.700
Can I take it home so I can paint it?

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.500
Of course.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.500
Here.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.900
What’s the matter?

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.500
I didn’t expect an IT guy like you
to have a tattoo like that.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.450
You like it?

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:24.600
Yes.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.890
Mr. Jira sent the suit back to us.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.850
He requested we send his clothes back.
[Please return to Korawic Kitiwela.]

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.300
They’re in the bathroom.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.400
Send them back to him.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.250
Should I put him on our blacklist, sir?

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.050
Not yet.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.050
Hey.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.100
Did you have to close
the entire pool down for this?

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:23.980
Who is this?

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.350
Your friend?

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:26.970
Don’t stare.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:28.800
Don’t mind me.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.000
I’m just a fly on the wall.
