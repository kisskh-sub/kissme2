a large sum of money.

Otherwise,

if there were tea to process,

would I have lost this badly?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.000
no one understanding you.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.750
There is a pine needle fragrance.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.210
You're absolutely right.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.440
This cast iron wok of mine,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.390
do you know how old it is?

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.300
No idea.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.900
Made during the Jiajing era
of the Ming Dynasty.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.140
It's this old?

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.200
This has been passed down
from the elders.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.380
The older a wok is, the better it works,
you know?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.800
It's just it rusts easily.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.650
And it gets hot to the touch.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.940
You need to use it often

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.510
and maintain it regularly.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.660
Do you know how

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.050
our elders maintained these woks?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.060
With pine needles?

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.830
That's right.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.600
Stir-frying pine needles
serves two purposes:

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.400
first, to let the young ones
practice their craft;

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.970
second, to extract the oil
from the pine needles

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.100
to season the wok.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.900
This wok has been used for
hundreds of years,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.320
so naturally the tea takes on

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.180
that subtle pinewood aroma.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.950
You can savor it subtly,
yet can't quite catch it.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.270
That's the beauty of it—

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.670
in its subtlety.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.140
Combined with the way
I control the heat when frying the tea,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.520
it makes the tea

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.310
taste fresh on the palate

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.460
with a lingering, delicate aftertaste.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.850
Alright, Father.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.460
Stop weighing yourself up

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.170
and singing your own praises.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.720
How is

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.850
Mr. Bai's health?

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.240
He's gotten better.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.970
That's good.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.080
After I finish processing this tea,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.210
I'll go check on him.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.130
Bring some more fresh tea leaves.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.690
I-I'll help.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.440
Hurry up.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.910
Listen, Pingyuan.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.480
I'm just like Mr. Bai,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.830
with only one daughter.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.340
If anyone tries to take my daughter away,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.600
I'll kill him.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.230
I think Pingwen

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.280
is a good man.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.090
To save his life,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.140
how about letting him be
my live-in son-in-law?

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.400
What's going on with you guys?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.100
Chop-chop.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.470
[Gu's Mansion]

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.040
Mother.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.780
It smells wonderful.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.370
Give it a taste.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.320
What's the rush?

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.840
I haven't finished enjoying the aroma yet.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.840
Drinking it now

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.010
would be a waste.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.790
Mrs. Gu,

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.150
you're an expert.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.170
I've grown tea my whole life

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.840
and have only managed to
understand a little.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.570
I wouldn't dare show off
in front of you, Mr. Liao.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.980
It's truly excellent.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.860
So tell me,

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.880
what makes it so good?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.060
As this tea goes down

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.330
from my lips to tongue,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.540
and then to throat,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.010
the aroma changes at every point.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.370
The fragrance is also quite peculiar.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.750
There's the fresh scent of pine needles

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.240
and also a hint of orchid fragrance.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.390
But I'm clearly drinking

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.870
our family's Silver Bud tea.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.110
What's going on here?

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.680
Why don't you take a guess?

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.260
Well, I think

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.570
since they burned the tea plantation,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.670
the soil got strong fire energy.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.560
And before harvesting the tea,

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.170
there were two rainfalls.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.650
The rain before Qingming Festival

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.400
is heavy with yin energy.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
The bright fire meets the yin water.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.210
Tea growers

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.670
call this fragrance
"the aroma of providence."

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.510
I don't know if I'm right.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.460
That's exactly it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.960
Mrs. Gu.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.630
I'm truly impressed by you.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.750
You're a real expert.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.000
So here's what I'll do.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.920
From now on,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.950
I'll process tea for your family

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.520
without charging a single penny.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.670
This won't do.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.480
Mr. Liao.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.090
Since we've obtained this fine tea,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.620
why don't you give it a name?

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.390
Then I'll respectfully oblige.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.860
I've been processing tea my entire life,

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.630
and this is the masterpiece of my life.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.270
There's an ancient book

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.000
on tea processing in my house.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.420
The book says,

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.140
"its fragrance resembles orchids,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.220
and its buds whiter than snow,

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.940
thus named Orchid Snow."

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.250
What do you think

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.240
of the name Orchid Snow?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.870
It sounds beautiful.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.440
Great.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.400
Orchid Snow.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.240
That's it then.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.900
Alright.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.550
I'll go check on Mr. Bai.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.750
I'll go with you.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.320
Let's go.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.220
Mr. Liao.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.720
I've asked Pingwen

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.510
to inform everyone in the village.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.890
I'm thinking about selling all the tea

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.290
of our village this year.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.910
Are you crazy?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.220
As you said,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.840
this tea has a unique aroma,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.030
which is truly extraordinary.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.790
I think it's a great business opportunity.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.450
So you know how to do business?

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.750
I didn't realize that.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.580
Do you know who

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.840
all this tea is for?

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.610
I do.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.080
Isn't it that Master Hou?Mr. Hou Er

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.080
He always buys

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.760
our tea at

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.980
the lowest price,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.030
[Gu's Mansion]

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.750
and he often

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.200
delays paying the tea farmers.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.060
So I want to take this opportunity

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.510
to sell it myself,

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.510
so as to give back to the villagers

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.370
and let them make some profit too.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.080
You... Sell it yourself?

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.680
Let me tell you something.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.160
Tea

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.220
is just like a young lady—

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.320
once this period passes,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.580
it won't be worth much.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.530
Thinking about

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.080
doing business.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.390
I mean, you...

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.600
I beat those 10 people so badly

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.670
that they even called me "father."

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.270
"Father."

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.300
What are you doing?

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.510
Why don't you

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.460
consider my suggestion?

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.960
Pingwen!

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.120
I asked you to collect tea buds.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.550
How many have you collected?

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.410
5,000 catties.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.360
5,000 catties?

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.680
You bought the whole village's tea?

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.970
You think I was joking?

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.050
I really bought it.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.390
That's quite a move.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.030
You're young, yet quite ambitious.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.820
This time,

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.829
you'll have to fight it out with them.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:06.960
Want to make a bet

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.910
and see who wins?

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.069
No.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.440
Father.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.480
I've been thinking.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.550
Those tea-processing utensils of ours,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.940
let's not take them back.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.400
So you won't pawn them again.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.550
Otherwise, you'll even have nothing
to brag about.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.770
Not taking them back?

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.790
Then who's going to maintain the wok?

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.790
You had it pawned for half a year.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.160
I didn't see you maintaining it either—

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.069
just left it in the pawnshop to rust.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.099
Don't always say things

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.290
I don't like to hear in front of others.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.330
What do we do
if we don't take the wok back?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.590
Leave it at his house.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.190
We'll come back to process tea again
next year.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.880
Gu Pingwen.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.870
Let's talk.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.770
I can see right through

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.800
your little schemes!

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.490
Ouch, ouch.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.710
Control your father!

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.400
Stop it.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.300
Alright.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.900
We still need to visit Mr. Bai.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.210
I'm watching you.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.270
The boiling water

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.660
has different stages.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.200
Right now, it's at the "crab-eye boil,"

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.200
when it looks like the eyes of a crab.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.420
At this point,

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.440
the water is 70% cooked

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.480
and 30% raw—

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.800
perfect for

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.240
brewing aged tea.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:23.700
Look,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.930
now

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.770
it's at "lotus-flower boil."

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.100
From bottom to top,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.590
it forms a column of water,

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.450
and the water bubbles grow larger
as they rise.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.110
The temperature now

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.250
is 90% cooked

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.680
and 10% raw.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.980
For brewing fresh tea,

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.020
this is the perfect timing.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.250
This water temperature

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.940
can also remove the grassy smell

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.240
from the tea leaves.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.310
Look.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.790
This is what we call "lotus-leaf boil."

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.520
It's 100% cooked.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.420
When a person gets old,

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.210
everything clears up—

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.730
except the blood vessels.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.270
They lose interest

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.740
in worldly matters.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.070
Living on in good health is alright,

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.350
but if they're alive
and constantly sick and frail,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.880
then there's no point in it.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.400
Might as well die early
and reincarnate sooner.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.940
Father.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.910
You're talking nonsense again.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.410
This snow you preserved last year

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.750
is really excellent.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.380
If you like it, drink more.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.380
It was Yimei's doing.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.240
I could never manage that kind of

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.820
slow, meticulous work.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.640
This snow was collected so well.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.340
I really can't bear to use it.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.410
If it's all gone,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.610
what will you drink?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.050
I won't be drinking it for much longer.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.000
That's true.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.810
Just drink it all.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.810
That kid is quite skillful.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.240
Every winter she would store

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.870
dozens of jars of snow in the cellar

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.470
for me to use for brewing tea.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.400
Those days are gone now.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.110
People can't possibly drink good tea

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.700
for a whole lifetime.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.550
When we have good tea, we drink it—

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.200
there's no need to hold back.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.750
And when it's gone, don't dwell on it.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.750
If you dwell on it,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.060
you're just making yourself suffer.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.790
That's true.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.200
I've enjoyed more than 10 years

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.510
of my daughter's care.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.880
How can I still be clinging to
these things?

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.410
You see things more clearly than I do.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.830
What's wrong?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.630
Nothing.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.110
Nothing?

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.900
You know, a gambler's eyes

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.400
are as sharp as scissors.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.080
Saying nothing's wrong?

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.460
Mr. Bai...

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.340
He's suffering greatly.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.200
Who in this world doesn't suffer?

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.920
Even the Emperor himself—

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.680
he used to be that happy,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.560
yet he died in Rehe,

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.520
becoming a ghost in a foreign land.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.200
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.920
Hurry up and plug

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.380
that hole under your nose.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.560
Mr. Liao isn't wrong though.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.370
Mr. Bai's pulse

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.320
has actually already stopped.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.680
Sometimes I can feel it, sometimes not.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.650
He's hanging on by a single breath.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.920
I know

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.240
there's resentment in his heart

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.350
and can't let go of certain matters.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.930
He always talks

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.680
as if he sees through everything,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.010
but that may not be true.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.480
People all have

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.050
their own attachments.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.100
Think about it—

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.270
if anyone dares to
run off with my daughter,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.390
I'll slaughter him with my own hands.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.630
Listen to yourself.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.650
These past days,

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.160
Mr. Bai can still occasionally

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.440
crack a joke or two,

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.960
but I know

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.490
he's just forcing himself.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.780
My friend Bai spent his whole life
doing good deeds.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.270
He doesn't deserve to suffer like this.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.970
Mr. Liao,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.300
what are you doing?

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.540
I'll go see him off.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.470
What are you trying to do?

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.240
Bai.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.640
This cup is already old.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.680
It's okay to replace it.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.740
Each generation has its own blessings.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.380
Holding onto it is pointless.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.310
Thanks a lot.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.620

You're a scholar,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.000
who buys our village's tea.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.060
This year, he heard you bought it all,

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.340
and he's a bit... A bit upset.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.310
He's resting at the ancestral hall now.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.710
He sent me to ask you over.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.350
He sent for me?

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.480
Tell him I'm not available.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.960
I'm not even fully awake yet.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.860
[Gu's Mansion]

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.830
Mr. Gu.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.180
Don't be like this.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.790
You really don't know

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.200
what Mr. Hou Er is capable of.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.720
It would scare you to death if I told you.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.980
Then tell me. Scare me.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.310
He's a member of
the Tea Merchants' Association.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.570
What's the Tea Merchants' Association?

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.150
In Anhui Province,

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.920
there's a Tea Merchants' Association.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.270
The members are all
centuries-old major tea guilds.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.700
All the tea trading

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.650
and transport is handled by them.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.220
As for this matter,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.720
it was just people from our village

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.880
trying to take advantage of you.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.030
[Gu's Mansion]

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.240
They saw your high offer

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240
and sold it to you.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.250
But you should know

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.790
this is the kind of thing
that can bring trouble.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:13.650
Bring trouble?

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.990
Haven't I brought enough trouble already?

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.140
Go tell that...

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.650
Hou Er, right?

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.160
Mr. Hou Er.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.510
Go tell Mr. Hou Er

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.000
that Mr. Gu will see him

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.920
after he's finished his breakfast

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.780
and had his tea,

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.800
and not before.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.960
If he doesn't like it,

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.150
he can go back where he came from.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:29.920
[Gu's Mansion]

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.160
You can't be like this.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.430
You're too young.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.930
You really don't know

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.440
what Mr. Hou Er is capable of.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.640
I've heard about him.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.000
Every time he comes,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.030
he acts like an emperor—

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.960
yelling and scolding,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.960
being picky about everything,

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.680
owing tea farmers money

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.510
and not paying for half a year at a time—

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:43.710
that's him, isn't it?

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.830
Tell him

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.550
I've decided to buy this batch of tea.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.270
I won't let him

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.030
have his way.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.480
If he's unhappy about it,

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.940
let him come to me himself.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.710
[Gu's Mansion]

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400
Mr. Hou Er,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.080
guess what?

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.290
Gu Pingyuan is not awake yet.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.930
You came too early.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.630
How about I get you some

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.410
food first?

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.640
Do you know how many villages

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.500
I visit in a day?

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.830
You want me to wait here
until he wakes up?

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:23.240
Go,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.640
bang something to wake him up.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.700
Please don't be like this, Mr. Hou Er.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.110
These tea pickers

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.720
go all day without food or water,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.350
and they can barely walk straight.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.430
If you have me bang on his door,

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.950
he'll beat me up.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.620
Gentlemen,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.410
welcome.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.200
What would you like to drink?

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.750
What good stuff do you have here?

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.240
What kind would you prefer?

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:53.770
This way.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.390
Local tea.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.280
For local tea,

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.640
I recommend Silver Bud.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.510
It's not expensive

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.970
and has a wonderful aroma.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.800
Bring us a bit of every kind.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.620
Try this Silver Bud.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:05.750
Please.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:12.830
What's wrong?

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.040
Is it not good?

Boss.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.600
Do we look like we can't afford to pay?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.480
Why didn't you bring us

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.680
your best Silver Bud?

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.270
I would never underestimate you gentlemen.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.130
This Silver Bud

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.570
is already top quality.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.810
This stuff of yours

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.940
is all coarse stems and large leaves.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.270
There's not a trace of
premium golden buds.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.200
Is this what you call

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.110
top quality?

[Tea Merchants' Association]

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.260
Old Master Hu.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.440
This Grand Tea Competition,

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.640
what exactly is it about?

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.070
Everyone's talking about it.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.650
We're all here to ask

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:03.880
what our Tea Merchants' Association

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.540
has in plan,

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.880
so we can prepare accordingly.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.750
Yes, indeed.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.430
Well...

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.480
That's just a gimmick.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.270
The new Emperor has just taken the throne,

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:13.920
those provinces south of Yangtze River

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.380
have just been liberated,

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.950
and the Grand Canal has been cleared.

[Old Master Hu, Head of
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association]

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.090
His Majesty had an idea

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.880
of transporting southern tea to the north,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.060
just to make everyone's lives

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.840
a bit more comfortable.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.000
You overcome all obstacles,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.110
build bridges where needed,

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.440
and I believe you'll bring

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.310
the gold-lettered plaque
of Top Tea Under Heaven

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.270
back for us at all costs!

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:32.640
That's right!

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.200
-Bring it back!
-Bring it back!

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.070
Therefore,

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.040
I've invited the capital's
biggest tea merchant,

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.280
Li Wantang,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.270
Mr. Li,

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.930
to Anhui for a meeting.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.640
It's said he has connections

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.510
in both official and commercial circles.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.470
He'll surely find a way.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.400
Speaking of this Grand Tea Competition,

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.690
it's organized by the greatest merchant

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.520
under heaven,

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.310
the capital's biggest tycoon,

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.270
Li Million,

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.400
Master Li Wantang.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.220
It just so happens that

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.400
the Empress Dowager's birthday
is approaching,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.270
and the young Emperor

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.960
wants to please his mother.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.480
That's why Master Li Wantang

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.680
came up with this idea

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.080
of gathering all the famous types of tea

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.320
from across the land

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.530
to Beijing

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:11.670
for a competition,

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.230
to rank them in order.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.340
In recent years,

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.230
tea in the capital

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.150
has been as precious as gold.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.820
One tael of ordinary Maojian

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.610
costs two strings of cash,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.639
and one tael of fine Hou Kui

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:29.590
or Longjing

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.630
costs one tael of gold per tael.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.920
Still in short supply.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.280
And now,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.000
the finest teas from across the land
gather in the capital.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.320
competing for the top position

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.050
and fighting for market share.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:44.840
The top-quality teas

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.000
are offered to the two Empress Dowagers,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.440
with His Majesty himself
inscribing calligraphy

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.480
on a grand plaque,

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.320
making them famous throughout the world.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.110
Wouldn't you agree

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.480
that this is truly
a once-in-a-millennium event?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.960
But there's something I don't understand.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.550
How do they rank these teas?

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.420
Hou Kui has its own merits,

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.150
and Silver Bud has its own charm.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.510
Some people prefer fresh tea,

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.840
others prefer aged tea.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.110
Thousands of people

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.710
have thousands of different tastes.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.000
So how do they determine
the top tea under heaven?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.480
Well...

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.460
I've got it.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.030
Whoever holds the higher rank

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.100
gets to decide.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.620
If His Majesty

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.030
declares something the best in the world,

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.760
you can't exactly disagree, can you?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.490
That's true.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.230
Indeed.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:23.880
Wholeheartedly convinced.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.400
That's great.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.360
I've got something to say!

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360
Are you crazy?

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.110
I can't hold it in any longer!

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.780
Excuse me, everyone.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.610
This is a distant cousin of mine

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.070
from another family line
who's not very capable.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.070
His name is Hou Er.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.810
He usually helps me manage
the tea collection.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.050
My apologies

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.270
if he's offended you.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.070
What do you have to say? Just say it.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.490
If there's someone who doesn't cooperate,

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.030
who doesn't take

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.070
our Tea Merchants' Association seriously,

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:55.880
what should we do?

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.410
What do you mean they don't
take us seriously?

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.220
Hoarding goods—

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.960
just refusing to sell to us.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.920
Our Tea Merchants' Association
isn't a government office.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.760
If they don't sell,

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.090
of course someone else will buy from them.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:11.920
Did you run your mouth

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.320
and offend someone?

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.630
Absolutely impossible.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.290
Please have a taste of our tea.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.250
It's excellent.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.330
That guy is just an exile.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.030
He's been inciting the villagers,

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.670
telling them not to sell tea
to our association.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.030
You know,

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.360
it would be one thing
if he just refuses to sell.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.480
The problem is he said
all those nasty things,

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.800
insulting you.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.550
I really couldn't stand it.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.340
How would he even know who I am?

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.670
D-Don't talk nonsense.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.960
I'm not! You...

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.080
Everyone's here.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.570
About this matter,

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.760
Old Master Hu may be able to tolerate it,

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.210
but I, Hou Er, cannot.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.790
From today on,

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.850
if anyone buys

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.840
even a single leaf of tea
from that village,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.320
it will be showing disrespect
to Old Master Hu

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.540
and to me, Hou Er.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:04.710
I'm telling you

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.110
that guy's name right now.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.940
His name is Gu Pingyuan.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.540
Gu Pingyuan.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.380
Gu Pingyuan.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.360
You're Mr. Gu Pingyuan, right?

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.820
And you're Mr. Gu Pingwen.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.650
Mr. Hou Er

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.470
has warned every shop

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.360
that if any tea from Shanjian Village

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.830
comes in, even one tael,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.190
that shop will be shut down.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.970
So as for the Huizhou area,

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.180
don't expect to sell any tea here.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.110
The Tea Merchants' Association

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.770
has such powerful influence.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.490
Indeed.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:37.980
For hundreds of years,

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.380
all the tea transported north and south
by river has been under their authority.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.920
Merchants' associations
across the country

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.320
communicate with each other,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.190
and in this trade,
they're the ones at the top.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.550
Whatever grievances we have,

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.780
we can't speak it out.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.250
How's that?

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.440
You heard all that?

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.210
What's the use of me hearing it?

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.480
You're the one who offended him,

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.400
not me.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.310
Pingyuan.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.520
What are you thinking about?

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.440
Tea.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.070
Come up with an idea then.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.160
Do you have any ideas?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.880
If you ask me,

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.670
just apologize and admit you were wrong.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.630
Why insist on butting heads like this?

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.230
So you also think I can't win?

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.980
What makes you think you can win?

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.810
We've visited so many shops—

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.840
which one of them dared to buy our tea?

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.800
I believe there must be a place
in this world

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.130
where reason prevails.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.120
Let's do this.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.900
When we get back, sort out

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.550
the best of our Orchid Snow tea.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.840
I'm going to the capital

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.240
to compete against them.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.510
You're going to the Grand Tea Competition?

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.190
You think you can bring back

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.360
His Majesty's gold-lettered plaque?

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:46.630
Even with a knife at your neck,

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.690
you still won't miss a chance to brag.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.760
Old Master Hu.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.200
You've got a visitor.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.710
I, Gu Pingyuan,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.980
pay my respects to you, Old Master Hu.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.360
Mr. Gu,

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.680
please sit down and talk.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.060
So you're the one

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.150
leading the others in refusing to sell tea

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.150
to our Tea Merchants' Association?

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.720
I wouldn't say I led them.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.000
Mr. Hou Er haggled too ruthlessly.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.210
I was upset at the time

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.920
and ended up speaking rather harshly.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.710
Old Master Hu, I know you are

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.760
the head of
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association,

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.020
so I've come specifically to apologize.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.320
This Hou Er

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.320
is indeed a distant relative of mine

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.780
from another family line.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.670
However,

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.050
since everyone

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.380
recognizes me as

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.940
the head of
the Tea Merchants' Association,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.630
they all say

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.070
I'm quite fair in my dealings.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.090
If Hou Er was in any way

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.180
remiss in his words,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.150
please forgive him, Mr. Gu.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.990
Please trouble yourself

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.690
to tell the villagers

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.570
to deliver the tea leaves

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.240
directly to
the Tea Merchants' Association.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.390
Old Master Hu.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.840
This is the new tea our family has grown.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.670
I've specially brought it over

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.600
for you to taste.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.610
[Orchid Snow]

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.710
Isn't this Silver Bud?

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.670
What do these words

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.220
"Orchid Snow" mean?

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.110
This tea is blessed by heaven and earth.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.920
After it's grown,

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.280
it has a unique aroma—

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.490
a subtle fragrance of orchids,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.160
yet also like green pines after snow:

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.800
crisp, pure, and noble.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.130
That's why we renamed it

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.210
"Orchid Snow."

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.550
The name of the tea

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.230
was decided by our ancestors.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.890
By changing its name randomly like this,

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.280
aren't you breaking

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.540
the ancestors' rules?

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.010
No wonder Hou Er wouldn't take it.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.040
Change it back to Silver Bud,

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.370
and then I'll taste it.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.630
Old Master Hu.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.030
This tea's fragrance

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.190
is truly different from
ordinary Silver Bud.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.520
It's a brand new flavor.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:24.360
Why don't you give it a try?

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.840
New or old, what nonsense.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.070
I've been in the tea business

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.410
my entire life.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.840
How could I allow
such disrespect for tradition?

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.840
If I let you get away with this today,

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.970
what if everyone

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.080
starts renaming them randomly?

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.000
Should I discipline them or not?

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.050
Change it back.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:54.180
I'm sorry. No can do.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.460
What are you doing?

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.650
I can walk by myself.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.590
Let's go. Hurry.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.370
Let go.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.770
They're finally back.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.030
Come on.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.030
Sit.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.710
Everyone's here.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.660
Tell us what happened.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.030
I don't quite understand yet.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.890
What happened?

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.270
The Tea Merchants' Association

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:28.000
has officially announced

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.150
they won't buy our village's tea anymore.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.610
Was it Hou Er who said that?

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.800
Not just Hou Er.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.450
If it were just Hou Er,
that would be fine.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.710
But if the Tea Merchants' Association

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.970
refuses to buy our tea,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.190
then it would be

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.120
a disaster for our entire village.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.360
Indeed.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.430
Come on.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.960
Bring the stuff up here.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:57.840
Tomorrow, you two brothers

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.900
carry these briers

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.670
and come with me to
the Tea Merchants' Association.
