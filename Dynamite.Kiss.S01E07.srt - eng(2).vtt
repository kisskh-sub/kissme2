EMERGENCY ROOM

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:02.834
EPISODE 7

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.336
Your son-in-law is so sweet
like a daughter.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:08.548
He's so well-mannered and handsome.

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.425
I'm so jealous.

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:11.509
-Thank you.
-My daughter

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:13.178
isn't even thinking about getting married.

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:15.555
I know, right?

00:01:16.306 --> 00:01:17.682
I wish he were my son-in-law.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.518
He's actually my daughter's friend.

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:23.271
He's such a great kid

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:26.399
that I wouldn't dare ask him
to take my immature daughter.

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:28.401
I'd feel too bad.

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:32.238
By the way,

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:34.282
is Da-rim still at work?

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:36.242
I'll call her and ask.

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.619
-Just a second.
-Okay.

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:39.829
That feels so good.

00:01:47.128 --> 00:01:49.797
The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:51.507
Please try again later.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.137
What's she up to?

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:17.075
SEON-U

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:35.760
KANGKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:57.198
Are you awake?

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.452
Are we at a hospital?

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.954
Yes.

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:05.581
You had stress-induced stomach cramps.

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:08.543
How do you feel now?

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:11.295
I feel so much better.

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:15.049
That's a relief.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.636
It looks like I stole your time again.

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:20.221
I'm sorry.

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:26.102
The IV drip is almost done,
so I can go home, right?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.647
Wait.

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:31.899
-Excuse me.
-Hold on.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.193
You can't go home today.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:41.451
I'm going to head out.
I guess Da-rim is busy today.

00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:43.036
I guess so.

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.371
All right. Get home safe.

00:03:46.372 --> 00:03:47.999
And make sure Jun eats well.

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.877
-Don't worry about that.
-All right.

00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:52.962
-I'll see you soon.
-All right.

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.964
-I'm off.
-Bye.

00:03:55.048 --> 00:03:57.300
-See you.
-See you soon.

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:59.761
I told you I'm really fine.

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:02.013
-I'm just going to go.
-Just do as I say.

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.640
The doctor said
you should stay here overnight.

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:07.310
Do you even know
how much a night in here will cost?

00:04:07.393 --> 00:04:09.103
Why can't I stay in a shared room?

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:11.439
What can we do?
This is the only room available.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.067
Since you fell sick on the clock,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.651
I'll cover the hospital bills,

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:17.070
so don't worry about that.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.781
Don't even try to
lift your head off that pillow.

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:21.491
I'll consider it insubordination

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:23.284
and dock your performance score heavily.

00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:25.244
Okay, fine.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.794
Water. I just want some water.

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:34.045
All right. Hold on.

00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:35.421
Just tell me. I'll do everything.

00:04:36.422 --> 00:04:37.632
I'm sorry.

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:50.770
Thank you.

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.692
Wow, that's so cool.

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:18.005
Ms. Go Da-rim?

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.134
-I'm here to check your blood pressure.
-Sure.

00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:32.687
Oh, that's strange.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.355
Why is it so high?

00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:39.527
Did the ER mention
any blood pressure issues?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.529
No, I don't believe so.

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:42.864
By any chance,

00:05:42.947 --> 00:05:46.868
do you feel short of breath
or hot in the face?

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:50.037
No, I feel very fine.

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:52.707
Could it be the machine?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.750
Yes, I think so.

00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:56.669
-Just a moment.
-Sure.

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:59.172
-I'll get the manual monitor and recheck.
-Okay.

00:06:07.054 --> 00:06:09.307
-I'm…
-Yes?

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.226
I'm going to go buy some drinks.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.814
Okay, then I'll stay right here.

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:18.191
Okay.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.028
Seriously?

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.893
That feels better.

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:47.947
Mom…

00:07:50.992 --> 00:07:52.410
Don't be sick.

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:57.248
I'll do better.

00:09:18.913 --> 00:09:20.623
You didn't go home…

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:27.672
and stayed by my side?

00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:44.832
Hello, sir.

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:49.628
You must've waited long.
Sorry, my flight was delayed.

00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:51.464
You must be tired.
Let me take your suitcase.

00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:53.591
No, it's light. Let's just go.

00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:55.134
But still, I should…

00:10:55.217 --> 00:10:58.137
It's okay, I can take it. Let's go.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.054
All right.

00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:01.474
Sir, here you go.

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:03.058
Please take me there.

00:11:05.436 --> 00:11:06.812
A dog shelter?

00:11:07.772 --> 00:11:09.440
It's in the opposite direction
from your house.

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.359
I know. I want to meet a friend first.

00:11:12.443 --> 00:11:14.695
Your mother is preparing a meal.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.655
Wouldn't it be best to go straight home?

00:11:16.739 --> 00:11:18.282
It's fine. Let's stop by there first.

00:11:19.617 --> 00:11:20.951
The truth is,

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:24.788
she specifically told me
that even if you ask to stop by somewhere,

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:27.208
I should ignore it
and bring you straight home.

00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:28.709
I see.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.003
All right, then.

00:11:31.587 --> 00:11:33.005
-Let's go home.
-Yes, sir.

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:48.812
Oh no.

00:11:48.896 --> 00:11:50.064
I only have US dollars on me.

00:11:50.564 --> 00:11:52.149
I'll leave you to exchange it.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.320
What's this, sir?

00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:58.572
What else could it be?
It's your severance pay.

00:11:58.656 --> 00:11:59.782
-Pardon?
-Oh.

00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:01.784
You don't need to come in
starting tomorrow.

00:12:02.535 --> 00:12:03.494
I don't understand.

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:06.705
You're just not getting it, are you?

00:12:07.623 --> 00:12:09.708
I really hate repeating things.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:10.668
Get lost.

00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:14.797
Take care.

00:12:30.437 --> 00:12:31.605
Mother.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:33.399
Oh, Tae-yeong!

00:12:33.482 --> 00:12:35.067
Come here and sit.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.152
These are the options
for our party invitations.

00:12:37.236 --> 00:12:39.405
Take a look
and choose your favorite design.

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:41.907
This just shows how much you love me.

00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:44.201
You prepared
such a wide selection of invitations.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.786
This is what I narrowed down.

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:46.829
He's a busy man.

00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:49.039
He's not here for a vacation.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.917
Don't drag him around for show.

00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:54.044
I'm gathering the most prominent families
in the business and political circles

00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:56.338
to see if any of their daughters
would be suitable for him.

00:12:56.422 --> 00:12:58.507
Come on, his divorce was just finalized.

00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:00.467
It's been 374 days.

00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.885
Is Ha-yeong not home?

00:13:01.969 --> 00:13:04.888
How could she not show her face
when her brother has come all this way?

00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:06.307
Who knows?

00:13:07.057 --> 00:13:09.226
So, how's the funding business going?

00:13:09.935 --> 00:13:11.895
We've been focusing on venture capital
for a while,

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:13.606
but now that the size
of our operation funds has grown,

00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:18.611
we're considering shifting our focus
to mid-sized or listed companies.

00:13:18.694 --> 00:13:20.404
Looking to swallow up
bigger companies, huh?

00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:22.656
That won't be easy.

00:13:23.574 --> 00:13:25.826
Securing management rights
and restructuring

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.536
will be met with a lot of resistance.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.704
That's true.

00:13:28.787 --> 00:13:32.541
But there's more to eat with a bigger fish
as long as you debone it properly.

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:39.048
Ta-da!

00:13:42.134 --> 00:13:45.137
Aren't you here today
for a meeting about the exhibition?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.221
I am,

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:48.724
but do you really think I came
all the way here just for a meeting?

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:50.684
I made all this.

00:13:50.768 --> 00:13:53.604
You'll like me even more
once you've tasted it.

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:55.606
Listen, Ms. Yu, I--

00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:57.900
Okay, I get it, but just try it first.

00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:03.864
How is it?

00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:04.907
Sure, it's…

00:14:06.033 --> 00:14:06.867
It's good.

00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:08.994
Right? You like me.

00:14:09.078 --> 00:14:10.746
No, that's not what I meant.

00:14:11.497 --> 00:14:13.290
How can a young, capable,
and pretty daughter of a rich family

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:14.833
also be a good cook?

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:19.213
You not falling for me
is a serious problem in itself.

00:14:19.296 --> 00:14:20.422
You need to see a doctor.

00:14:23.467 --> 00:14:25.594
Anyway, I thought about it.

00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:27.846
What if the works in the exhibition

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.933
reflect more of the children's
daily lives?

00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:34.937
Ordinary daily life
meets the great outdoors?

00:14:35.521 --> 00:14:36.563
That sounds nice.

00:14:36.647 --> 00:14:37.898
It reminds you
that protecting the environment

00:14:37.982 --> 00:14:41.110
isn't some grand undertaking
but a part of everyday life.

00:14:42.152 --> 00:14:45.197
Then how about we hire
more relatable models?

00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:46.949
Could you elaborate?

00:14:47.032 --> 00:14:50.035
Instead of using professional models,
you could capture a real family.

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:51.829
A real family…

00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:54.248
It's the pretty lady!

00:14:55.332 --> 00:14:56.375
Jun!

00:14:56.917 --> 00:14:58.752
I thought you were
going to the playground.

00:14:58.836 --> 00:15:00.004
I hurt myself.

00:15:00.963 --> 00:15:02.548
You're all scratched up.

00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:05.426
Stay here. I'll go get some ointment.

00:15:08.137 --> 00:15:11.390
Jun, did you miss me? I missed you.

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:12.850
I missed you.

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:15.686
Right? I knew it. Come here.

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:17.688
Try some. I made it.

00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:21.358
It's so tasty!

00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:23.235
Don't you like me even more now?

00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:25.154
I do. A lot more.

00:15:25.237 --> 00:15:27.031
You're so much better than your dad.

00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:28.407
-Is it good?
-Yes.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.325
All right. Open up.

00:15:30.409 --> 00:15:31.702
Look at you eat.

00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:33.704
You eat so well. Good boy.

00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:43.380
NATURAL BEBE
A GREEN FUTURE WE DREW TOGETHER

00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:47.217
We'd like to sincerely welcome
all the newlywed couples joining us

00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:50.804
for Natural BeBe's campaign,
A Green Future We Drew Together.

00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:02.107
Twenty years ago,
Natural BeBe built this family park

00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:06.653
and planted a lot of trees
as part of our CSR initiative.

00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:09.198
The saplings we planted back then

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:12.117
have grown to be trees
that are taller than my children

00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:13.869
to create this green forest.

00:16:13.952 --> 00:16:16.038
The trees we plant today

00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:18.582
will grow big and strong
alongside our children

00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:20.501
-to provide fresh air
-The day has finally come.

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:22.211
-for them to breathe.
-I can't believe we really did it.

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:26.048
-We, Natural BeBe, will always be with you
-I feel so overwhelmed.

00:16:26.131 --> 00:16:27.758
-Da-rim, me too.
-and do our best

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:30.969
-Me too.
-to make that happen.

00:16:31.053 --> 00:16:31.929
Thank you.

00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:35.390
-Are you okay? Oh dear.
-Kang Dae-seong!

00:16:35.474 --> 00:16:38.227
I told you not to fool around
at Mommy's workplace.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.812
You need to stay right by my side.

00:16:40.854 --> 00:16:42.815
Sorry, my husband
is at his weekend part-time job,

00:16:42.898 --> 00:16:44.483
so I had no one to watch my youngest.

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:46.401
I'm glad you brought him.

00:16:47.027 --> 00:16:47.861
Dae-seong.

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:49.363
You can play all you want,

00:16:49.446 --> 00:16:52.324
but do so where we can see you, okay?

00:16:52.407 --> 00:16:53.283
Okay.

00:16:53.367 --> 00:16:54.993
Excellent. One more!

00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:56.161
-You're so cute.
-Yes!

00:16:57.371 --> 00:16:59.623
-You're just too cute.
-So cute!

00:17:00.207 --> 00:17:01.291
Thank you.

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:06.547
Now, we'll proceed
with the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:19.935
Here you go.

00:17:20.018 --> 00:17:21.937
-You can pick whatever you like.
-Thank you.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.063
Please head over there.

00:17:23.147 --> 00:17:24.565
-Can we take this?
-Yes, of course.

00:17:24.648 --> 00:17:26.817
You can take this
and grab a sapling from over there.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.068
Thank you.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.612
Ms. Lee.

00:17:30.696 --> 00:17:32.072
SAPLING BAG

00:17:38.412 --> 00:17:40.706
My, you're all working so hard.

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:42.749
-Hey!
-Oh my.

00:17:44.126 --> 00:17:48.005
The TF team is doing an excellent job.

00:17:48.088 --> 00:17:49.882
I look forward to
seeing more from you all.

00:17:49.965 --> 00:17:52.593
We'll do our very best
to meet your expectations, sir.

00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:55.846
We solemnly vow to loyally
put our hearts and souls into it.

00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:57.097
-I vow too.
-I do as well.

00:17:57.639 --> 00:17:58.473
That's right.

00:17:59.933 --> 00:18:02.895
I know it's hard work,
but please keep it up.

00:18:02.978 --> 00:18:05.314
Gosh, it's not hard at all.

00:18:05.397 --> 00:18:08.567
If it's for the company,
we can do more than plant trees.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.819
We can even move that mountain.

00:18:10.903 --> 00:18:12.905
-We got this!
-We got this!

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.417
All right, keep up the good work.
You got this!

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.753
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir!
-Thank you, sir!

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.391
What about the manual?

00:18:43.977 --> 00:18:45.145
-Why are you following us?
-Pardon?

00:18:46.396 --> 00:18:47.648
-I need to get back.
-Where?

00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:48.649
Am I planting trees too?

00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:50.692
Do I look like
I care about trees right now?

00:19:01.703 --> 00:19:02.788
I can carry that for you.

00:19:02.871 --> 00:19:04.039
-We're done shoveling.
-No, I'm fine.

00:19:04.122 --> 00:19:05.582
It's fine. Let me.

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:07.876
Look at that. They're all doing so well.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.419
I really don't mind.

00:19:09.503 --> 00:19:10.963
-Let's see.
-Carrying things is my forte.

00:19:11.046 --> 00:19:12.756
Yours will be named "Dae-seong Tree."

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:14.925
-Right? It's named after you!
-Yeah, that's right.

00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:18.345
Once you plant this tree,
it'll grow as big as…

00:19:25.644 --> 00:19:26.478
Thank you.

00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:33.527
One, two.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.444
A bit ahead.

00:19:35.362 --> 00:19:37.531
Oh my. Thank you, Mr. Gong.

00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.379
Damn it.

00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:08.228
Go on, put it in.

00:20:09.354 --> 00:20:10.856
Oh, right. Yes.

00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:17.446
Dae-seong, are you throwing this away?

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:20.574
No. I heard if you plant it in the ground,
it'll grow big and strong.

00:20:21.408 --> 00:20:22.326
I see.

00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:27.080
You want this robot to grow big
so you can ride it around, huh?

00:20:29.624 --> 00:20:31.251
I got bad news for you, Dae-seong.

00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:32.919
I've already claimed this spot

00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:35.005
because I also want to grow taller.

00:20:35.797 --> 00:20:39.426
We should ask the doctor
to modify it and make it bigger.

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:40.552
What do you think?

00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:43.805
-Okay!
-All right. Good.

00:20:43.889 --> 00:20:45.390
Bye, robot.

00:20:47.392 --> 00:20:48.769
What are you doing?

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:52.147
You said you wanted to grow taller.
I was just planting you.

00:20:53.482 --> 00:20:54.858
I won't be the only one to grow.

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:56.818
You should grow too.

00:20:56.902 --> 00:20:58.737
-Give me your feet.
-I'm all grown up.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.364
I'm perfectly happy
with my height right now.

00:21:00.447 --> 00:21:02.574
Come on now. The taller, the better.

00:21:02.657 --> 00:21:04.117
What are you doing?

00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:05.494
Stop it.

00:21:05.577 --> 00:21:08.038
Let's go for two meters, Mr. Gong!

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.208
Would you like me to plant you
so you can grow nice and tall?

00:21:12.376 --> 00:21:13.210
No, thanks.

00:21:13.877 --> 00:21:14.711
Okay.

00:21:25.305 --> 00:21:26.139
Where did they go?

00:21:27.891 --> 00:21:29.142
Darn it.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.532
This is so exhausting.

00:21:44.282 --> 00:21:46.118
Do you like that? Does that feel good?

00:21:46.201 --> 00:21:47.327
Oh, look at you.

00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:49.454
You love it, don't you?

00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:52.416
Ji-hye.

00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:08.723
You still haven't quit?

00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:18.650
I thought you did.

00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:25.198
I did.

00:22:26.658 --> 00:22:28.535
But someone made me start again.

00:22:29.244 --> 00:22:30.245
I'm to blame?

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.291
How did I end up
at your wedding reception?

00:22:35.167 --> 00:22:36.710
Last Christmas…

00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:41.715
we were staying in a suite
at this very hotel.

00:22:43.383 --> 00:22:45.719
Your father is to blame for that.

00:22:45.802 --> 00:22:48.221
He probably ordered you to attend today.

00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:52.184
And you're a sweet daughter
who listens to her father's every word.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:57.814
It's a compliment.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.775
I've always liked that about you.

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:02.944
You work so hard to be
an obedient daughter.

00:23:03.653 --> 00:23:04.988
And you know your place.

00:23:06.198 --> 00:23:08.617
Being his dead lover's secret child…

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:12.287
doesn't seem to hinder you one bit.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:18.710
So that was it?

00:23:22.714 --> 00:23:24.382
That's why you kept our relationship
a secret the whole time.

00:23:26.718 --> 00:23:27.552
Why?

00:23:30.138 --> 00:23:31.890
Were you worried
I might hinder your future?

00:23:36.228 --> 00:23:37.312
I'm sorry.

00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:40.315
I'm too ambitious to risk
being weighed down by you.

00:23:40.982 --> 00:23:42.192
But don't worry.

00:23:42.776 --> 00:23:44.361
Your secret is safe with me.

00:23:45.153 --> 00:23:47.781
We might not become family,

00:23:48.323 --> 00:23:50.784
but I hope we can still be friends
who cheer each other on.

00:24:03.964 --> 00:24:05.340
I thought you were in the US.

00:24:05.882 --> 00:24:07.592
I'm here for a short business trip.

00:24:08.343 --> 00:24:09.344
And to see you.

00:24:12.973 --> 00:24:15.809
I'm sure you heard about my divorce.

00:24:19.062 --> 00:24:20.063
I missed you.

00:24:22.607 --> 00:24:23.858
What do you want?

00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:25.402
I came to treat you to a meal.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.154
I hear you're a director now.

00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:30.282
I'm so proud of you.

00:24:30.907 --> 00:24:32.117
There's no need to be.

00:24:32.993 --> 00:24:34.369
It's all thanks to you.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.580
I learned the hard way
that the only way to stop people

00:24:38.623 --> 00:24:40.583
from looking down on me
as the illegitimate child

00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:42.585
was to prove my worth
through my abilities.

00:24:44.254 --> 00:24:45.755
Do you know why I left you?

00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:49.134
You had

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:51.594
an uncanny resemblance to them.

00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:53.847
Your eyes, to be precise.

00:24:57.475 --> 00:24:59.227
On the surface,
you acted like you weren't,

00:24:59.853 --> 00:25:01.479
but you were always anxious

00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:04.065
and craved affection.

00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:10.030
But I see you've changed a lot
since I last saw you.

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:11.906
I can now see

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:14.409
greed in your eyes.

00:25:17.245 --> 00:25:18.330
Now that you know, you can leave.

00:25:19.497 --> 00:25:21.416
I have no interest in mind games anymore.

00:25:33.428 --> 00:25:35.347
GO YEONG-SIK
APRIL 27, 2025

00:25:40.518 --> 00:25:41.436
There we go.

00:25:47.317 --> 00:25:48.735
"Go Yeong-sik"?

00:25:49.736 --> 00:25:52.155
It's my late father's name.

00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:56.826
"Yeong" as in "outstanding,"
and "sik" as in "to plant."

00:25:58.953 --> 00:26:00.246
The perfect name for a tree, right?

00:26:02.749 --> 00:26:06.336
I hope you grow strong like my father.

00:26:08.671 --> 00:26:11.216
All right, let's head back down now!

00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:12.467
Thank you for your hard work!

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:14.677
-Could you take a picture of me? Thanks.
-All right.

00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:16.888
I guess that's a wrap. Shall we head down?

00:26:17.472 --> 00:26:18.890
-Shall we?
-Yes.

00:26:20.308 --> 00:26:22.769
-That came out nice.
-Yeah? Thank you very much.

00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:23.812
Do you two want one too?

00:26:23.895 --> 00:26:26.815
Mr. Gong, we should take a group photo.

00:26:26.898 --> 00:26:29.442
Wait, where did Ms. Bae go?

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:31.152
Nan-suk? She was here just a minute ago.

00:26:31.736 --> 00:26:33.988
Da-rim, have you seen Dae-seong anywhere?

00:26:34.072 --> 00:26:35.949
Didn't you two head down together?

00:26:36.032 --> 00:26:37.242
I haven't seen him in a while.

00:26:38.076 --> 00:26:39.369
He just disappeared all of a sudden.

00:26:39.452 --> 00:26:41.329
Where in the world did he go?

00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:42.747
He was just with you.

00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:45.333
-Let's split up and look for him.
-Okay.

00:26:46.751 --> 00:26:48.294
Dae-seong!

00:26:48.378 --> 00:26:50.213
-Dae-seong!
-Dae-seong!

00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:51.714
I'll go this way.

00:26:53.425 --> 00:26:54.968
-Dae-seong!
-Dae-seong!

00:26:55.552 --> 00:26:56.511
-Dae-seong!
-Dae-seong!

00:26:56.594 --> 00:26:57.720
Dae-seong!

00:26:57.804 --> 00:26:58.763
Dae-seong!

00:27:00.473 --> 00:27:01.433
Dae-seong!

00:27:02.225 --> 00:27:03.393
Dae-seong!

00:27:04.978 --> 00:27:05.854
Kang Dae-seong!

00:27:05.937 --> 00:27:07.856
-Where did he go?
-Wait for me, Nan-suk.

00:27:08.523 --> 00:27:09.566
Dae-seong!

00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:11.359
Dae-seong!

00:27:11.443 --> 00:27:12.277
Dae-seong…

00:27:15.572 --> 00:27:16.531
DO NOT ENTER

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.950
Dae-seong.

00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:20.577
Dae-seong!

00:27:21.453 --> 00:27:22.579
Dae-seong!

00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:24.539
Dae-seong!

00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:28.126
Dae-seong!

00:27:28.209 --> 00:27:29.210
Dae-seong!

00:27:31.087 --> 00:27:32.505
Dae-seong!

00:27:33.882 --> 00:27:36.259
Dae-seong!

00:27:36.342 --> 00:27:37.510
Dae-seong!

00:27:37.594 --> 00:27:38.470
Dae…

00:27:43.766 --> 00:27:44.893
Dae-seong!

00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:47.312
Kang Dae-seong!

00:28:19.469 --> 00:28:21.471
A squirrel? Seriously?

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:23.681
Who said you could chase after a squirrel?

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:25.475
I told you to stay close to Mommy!

00:28:25.558 --> 00:28:27.644
Do you know how much trouble
you caused everyone here?

00:28:27.727 --> 00:28:28.937
I can't believe you!

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.605
-Nan-suk, that's enough.
-My goodness.

00:28:30.688 --> 00:28:31.981
He was scared too.

00:28:32.065 --> 00:28:33.733
-We found him. That's what matters.
-I can't believe you.

00:28:33.816 --> 00:28:35.902
-Don't worry. It's okay, Dae-seong.
-Why are you crying?

00:28:35.985 --> 00:28:36.986
MOTHER TF TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.948
Mr. Kang, where's Da-rim and Mr. Gong?

00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:42.742
I got in touch with Mr. Gong,
but Ms. Go isn't answering.

00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:44.285
It's okay. Your mom was just scared.

00:28:44.369 --> 00:28:46.371
She was just scared. It's okay.

00:28:46.454 --> 00:28:47.288
It's raining.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.582
-Oh no.
-Are you serious?

00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:51.292
-Oh no. Nan-suk, it's raining.
-Oh no.

00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:53.336
-We should head down with Dae-seong first.
-Oh gosh.

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:59.592
DO NOT ENTER

00:29:05.014 --> 00:29:06.099
Hey, I'm on my way.

00:29:12.146 --> 00:29:12.981
What?

00:29:22.031 --> 00:29:23.032
Da-rim!

00:29:24.117 --> 00:29:24.951
Da-rim!

00:29:25.785 --> 00:29:26.661
Da-rim!

00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:29.873
Da-rim!

00:29:30.456 --> 00:29:32.834
Da-rim!

00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:33.918
Da-rim!

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:45.388
Da-rim.

00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:52.729
Da-rim.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.856
Da-rim.

00:29:56.274 --> 00:29:57.108
Da-rim.

00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:01.905
Hold on.

00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:06.993
-Mr. Gong?
-Are you okay?

00:30:07.076 --> 00:30:08.161
Yes.

00:30:10.955 --> 00:30:13.291
What about Dae-seong? Did they find him?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.376
He's with Ms. Bae right now.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.586
Thank goodness.

00:30:23.885 --> 00:30:25.386
Let's go in there for now.

00:30:40.818 --> 00:30:42.195
NATURAL BEBE ASSISTANT MANAGER

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:44.948
Hello, Mr. Kang. How did the event--

00:30:46.574 --> 00:30:47.492
What?

00:30:49.327 --> 00:30:50.620
Okay, I'll be on my way.

00:30:50.703 --> 00:30:51.788
What's wrong?

00:30:51.871 --> 00:30:53.539
Da-rim disappeared in the mountains.

00:30:53.623 --> 00:30:55.708
Can you watch Jun for a bit?

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:58.878
All right. You should hurry.

00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:00.463
Thank you so much.

00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:04.384
Drive safely. Don't rush.

00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:09.555
Hey, I found her.

00:31:09.639 --> 00:31:10.598
You did?

00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:12.183
That's a relief.

00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:14.602
-Are you on your way down?
-No.

00:31:14.686 --> 00:31:17.438
We're at the bottom of a slope.
We can't really climb up right now.

00:31:17.522 --> 00:31:19.273
We managed to find a cave nearby.

00:31:19.357 --> 00:31:20.274
A cave?

00:31:20.358 --> 00:31:22.527
-It's located…
-Ji-hyeok, you're breaking up.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.486
Can you repeat…

00:31:23.987 --> 00:31:25.196
Hello?

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.114
Hel--

00:31:26.864 --> 00:31:28.116
Mr. Kang, what did he say?

00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:29.993
The call dropped.

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:42.005
OUT OF SERVICE AREA

00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:51.014
They'll be heading over
as soon as the rain stops.

00:31:51.097 --> 00:31:52.223
Okay.

00:31:58.271 --> 00:31:59.272
Hold on.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.946
Here.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.322
Thank you.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.939
You know,

00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:44.817
you're just like my dad in some ways.

00:32:46.069 --> 00:32:47.153
What do you mean?

00:32:47.737 --> 00:32:48.821
My dad

00:32:49.989 --> 00:32:52.283
used to be a taxi driver.

00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:54.702
Whenever I found myself in trouble,

00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:57.121
he appeared out of nowhere.

00:32:58.081 --> 00:32:59.332
On rainy days,

00:33:00.374 --> 00:33:02.794
he'd just suddenly pop out of nowhere
with an umbrella.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.046
If I ever got hurt,

00:33:06.297 --> 00:33:09.258
I'd suddenly find myself on his back
as he ran to get me help.

00:33:09.926 --> 00:33:12.095
It was as if we had telepathy
or something.

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:16.974
And you're like that too.

00:33:19.352 --> 00:33:21.312
Even now, you're by my side.

00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:25.191
It's really amazing.

00:33:27.568 --> 00:33:28.945
You're being looked out for.

00:33:29.487 --> 00:33:30.321
Sorry?

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:35.326
As your father,

00:33:36.702 --> 00:33:38.287
he must've been looking out for you.

00:33:39.997 --> 00:33:41.999
And despite the distance,
the worry remains.

00:33:50.967 --> 00:33:51.801
Right.

00:33:52.802 --> 00:33:54.220
I was so lost

00:33:55.054 --> 00:33:56.848
after my dad passed away.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.725
I didn't let it show in front of my mom…

00:34:01.727 --> 00:34:04.188
but his absence felt so big to me.

00:34:15.825 --> 00:34:17.243
Is that why you married young?

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.621
Because you wanted to

00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:24.083
fill the void your dad left?

00:34:29.213 --> 00:34:30.339
I'm not sure.

00:34:31.632 --> 00:34:34.010
But I guess that's a possibility.

00:34:38.598 --> 00:34:39.807
You could've taken it a little slower.

00:34:41.392 --> 00:34:42.643
What was the rush?

00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:44.854
Pardon?

00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:48.274
It's nothing.

00:34:51.903 --> 00:34:53.654
I wonder when this rain will stop.

00:34:57.742 --> 00:34:58.993
When can we get back up there?

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:00.953
We'll see if we can in an hour.

00:35:01.037 --> 00:35:03.247
-What happened?
-Hey, Mr. Kim.

00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:04.916
Luckily, Mr. Gong found her.

00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:06.626
They've taken shelter in a cave.

00:35:06.709 --> 00:35:09.921
Once the rain stops, I'm going to head up
with the rescue team.

00:35:10.463 --> 00:35:13.174
Entry's difficult right now.
We should be able to enter in an hour.

00:35:15.301 --> 00:35:16.844
-Mr. Kim!
-Oh no! Mr. Kim!

00:35:16.928 --> 00:35:18.638
-Mr. Kim!
-Oh gosh.

00:35:18.721 --> 00:35:20.473
Oh no. What should we do?

00:35:20.556 --> 00:35:21.474
Mr. Kim!

00:35:22.183 --> 00:35:23.309
Da-rim!

00:35:24.644 --> 00:35:25.937
Go Da-rim!

00:35:28.022 --> 00:35:29.148
Da-rim!

00:36:03.224 --> 00:36:05.434
You must be cold too.

00:36:07.228 --> 00:36:08.271
I'm fine.

00:36:10.481 --> 00:36:11.732
I'm sorry.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.684
Let's just stay like this
for a little while

00:36:47.601 --> 00:36:48.936
and not think about anything.

00:37:41.572 --> 00:37:42.990
Yes!

00:37:47.244 --> 00:37:48.079
Checkmate.

00:37:49.288 --> 00:37:50.831
Yes! Come on, baby!

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.002
Some challenges are best avoided.

00:37:55.086 --> 00:37:57.254
I was a chess prodigy in Hannam-dong
when I was a kid.

00:37:57.338 --> 00:37:59.006
How do you become one of those?

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.092
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

00:38:01.175 --> 00:38:02.093
It's simple.

00:38:03.094 --> 00:38:05.179
Don't study. Just play chess.

00:38:05.262 --> 00:38:06.597
I see.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.309
Let's play one more game.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.645
No, we've already played too many.

00:38:12.728 --> 00:38:13.979
You need to sleep now.

00:38:14.063 --> 00:38:16.857
Playing with my dad is no fun
because he's so bad.

00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:20.152
I'll play one more game
if you tell me something.

00:38:20.236 --> 00:38:21.570
What is it?

00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:25.282
What does your dad like? Besides you.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.035
-Fried chicken, Americano, and--
-Hold on.

00:38:29.286 --> 00:38:31.580
Fried chicken, Americano, and?

00:38:31.664 --> 00:38:32.498
BLACKPINK.

00:38:36.752 --> 00:38:38.629
Then what does he dislike?

00:38:40.047 --> 00:38:41.382
When people break promises.

00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:42.716
Promises?

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.219
If I promise to brush my teeth
after eating snacks and I don't,

00:38:45.302 --> 00:38:47.763
or if I promise to clean up my toys
and I don't,

00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:48.848
he gets really mad.

00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:51.892
I see.

00:38:52.768 --> 00:38:53.686
Breaking promises?

00:38:58.274 --> 00:38:59.692
Go Da-rim!

00:39:00.651 --> 00:39:02.361
Where are you, Da-rim?

00:39:03.571 --> 00:39:04.655
Da-rim!

00:39:05.406 --> 00:39:07.074
Go Da-rim!

00:39:07.992 --> 00:39:09.201
Can you hear me?

00:39:12.121 --> 00:39:13.706
Where are you, Da-rim?

00:39:25.759 --> 00:39:26.760
Mr. Gong.

00:39:28.095 --> 00:39:29.513
I think I'm fine…

00:39:32.183 --> 00:39:34.101
Are you okay?

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:36.770
He's burning up.

00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:41.817
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.986
Oh no. This is all my fault.

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:45.821
You're so hot.

00:39:46.363 --> 00:39:47.198
Are you okay?

00:39:47.781 --> 00:39:49.867
You need to stay with me.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.120
Are you okay?

00:39:56.499 --> 00:39:58.709
Can you hear me?

00:40:01.337 --> 00:40:03.047
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:14.683
I'm…

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.021
not a good person.

00:40:20.272 --> 00:40:21.148
Sorry?

00:40:21.732 --> 00:40:22.691
I'm also…

00:40:25.152 --> 00:40:26.111
swayed.

00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:29.490
I think

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.743
you're a really great person.

00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:37.039
You're nice to me
only because I'm a member of your team.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.250
But still…

00:40:45.923 --> 00:40:49.176
I find myself being swayed.

00:41:23.544 --> 00:41:24.545
Da-rim!

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.256
Da-rim!

00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:28.215
Da…

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.926
Da-rim?

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.428
Da-rim!

00:41:33.178 --> 00:41:34.638
Da-rim! Are you okay?

00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:36.765
Are you hurt?

00:41:36.849 --> 00:41:38.267
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:39.268
No, I'm okay.

00:41:45.524 --> 00:41:47.651
I'm fine, but Mr. Gong is…

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:54.867
Let's go. Come on.

00:41:55.618 --> 00:41:57.119
Okay, let's go.

00:41:57.202 --> 00:41:58.037
Easy, easy.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.204
Be careful.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.957
-Take my hand.
-Okay.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.907
What do you think you're doing?

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.340
Ji-hyeok!

00:42:52.091 --> 00:42:53.425
They're over here!

00:43:09.316 --> 00:43:11.026
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:43:11.694 --> 00:43:13.320
Slowly. Watch your step.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:15.406
Careful.

00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:19.743
Slowly.

00:43:20.869 --> 00:43:21.870
Slowly.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.374
Ji-hyeok!

00:43:26.083 --> 00:43:26.917
Ji-hyeok!

00:43:27.459 --> 00:43:28.961
Hey, Ji-hyeok!

00:43:29.044 --> 00:43:30.462
They're over here!

00:43:32.131 --> 00:43:33.090
Are you okay, Ms. Go?

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:35.300
Ji-hyeok!

00:43:35.384 --> 00:43:36.301
Ji-hyeok!

00:43:37.094 --> 00:43:38.011
Are you okay?

00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:41.348
Do you know how worried I was?

00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:43.100
Can I get a towel?

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:44.893
I can't believe this.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.605
Can I get something to cover him up with?

00:44:00.617 --> 00:44:01.577
Here.

00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:06.331
Mr. Kang picked it up.
He found it near where you fell.

00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:07.666
Right.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.001
I should thank him.

00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:13.005
Da-rim.

00:44:13.672 --> 00:44:14.548
Yeah?

00:44:15.132 --> 00:44:17.801
Why did Mr. Gong do that earlier?

00:44:17.885 --> 00:44:19.636
Even with me there,
he refused to let go of your hand.

00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:24.308
Maybe you should quit your job.

00:44:25.893 --> 00:44:27.978
Where did that come from?

00:44:28.061 --> 00:44:31.064
I'll take care of the hospital bills
and loan interest somehow.

00:44:31.148 --> 00:44:32.775
I can ask for an advance
on the photography exhibition.

00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:34.526
Why would you do that?

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.696
What?

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.656
Why would you go that far?

00:44:40.282 --> 00:44:41.784
I appreciate the thought,

00:44:42.367 --> 00:44:44.745
but I don't want to lose a friend
because I relied on them for money.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.167
And you're fine with relying on Mr. Gong?

00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.924
What?

00:44:57.007 --> 00:45:00.052
Think about how he paid off your debt
and what he did today.

00:45:00.135 --> 00:45:02.012
It looks to me like you and Mr. Gong

00:45:02.095 --> 00:45:04.515
are more than just a team leader
and a team member.

00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:07.351
I definitely think
he has feelings for you.

00:45:07.434 --> 00:45:08.560
It's nothing like that.

00:45:09.144 --> 00:45:11.021
He was delirious because he was sick.

00:45:11.104 --> 00:45:12.314
That's why he acted like that.

00:45:12.981 --> 00:45:13.857
That's why.

00:45:14.816 --> 00:45:15.651
Yeah.

00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:34.169
We should stop by the ER.

00:45:35.087 --> 00:45:36.797
Your face is so pale right now.

00:45:39.466 --> 00:45:40.801
I took medicine for the fever.

00:45:41.593 --> 00:45:42.469
I'm fine.

00:45:42.553 --> 00:45:44.012
I know, but still.

00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:47.432
I just want to go home.

00:45:49.226 --> 00:45:50.227
I want to rest.

00:46:32.603 --> 00:46:34.229
You're such a family man, Mr. Gong.

00:46:34.313 --> 00:46:36.315
You even come to look after your wife.

00:46:36.398 --> 00:46:39.109
Please, I'm just doing what's right.

00:46:39.192 --> 00:46:41.820
I wonder if this is even worth
writing an article about.

00:46:45.616 --> 00:46:47.200
This is it.

00:46:47.284 --> 00:46:48.535
Please come in.

00:46:50.245 --> 00:46:51.079
Honey.

00:47:00.088 --> 00:47:02.257
Did she go out for a walk?

00:47:02.841 --> 00:47:04.801
Go and look for her.
The reporter is waiting.

00:47:04.885 --> 00:47:06.261
Yes, sir.

00:47:14.728 --> 00:47:16.146
Does he have to take it today?

00:47:16.229 --> 00:47:17.606
He wants to release the photo of him
caring for his wife

00:47:17.689 --> 00:47:19.274
at the same time
as the new product launch.

00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:22.235
Jeez, did she really have to hide
and make our lives harder?

00:47:24.404 --> 00:47:26.782
-There she is. Over there.
-What?

00:47:33.955 --> 00:47:35.290
Go that way. Check the stairs.

00:47:42.547 --> 00:47:44.883
I'm Chairman Gong's secretary.
His wife is missing from the VIP room.

00:47:44.966 --> 00:47:46.385
Did she come this way by any chance?

00:47:46.468 --> 00:47:49.221
She was just in her room.
I'm not sure where she is.

00:47:49.763 --> 00:47:51.139
We need to find her right now.

00:47:51.223 --> 00:47:54.017
Please make an announcement
and contact security.

00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:55.477
Okay.

00:48:05.821 --> 00:48:07.030
Oh my gosh!

00:48:07.114 --> 00:48:08.657
-I'm sorry.
-Seriously?

00:48:09.366 --> 00:48:10.992
-Unbelievable.
-Ma'am, by any chance,

00:48:11.076 --> 00:48:13.120
did a woman with crutches come in here?

00:48:13.203 --> 00:48:14.705
-She did.
-Where is she?

00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:16.456
Right there and there.

00:48:17.124 --> 00:48:18.625
I'm the only one here without crutches.

00:48:18.709 --> 00:48:20.085
No, not those people.

00:48:20.168 --> 00:48:21.962
I wouldn't know about the patients
in the other rooms.

00:48:22.045 --> 00:48:23.213
I'm sorry.

00:48:23.296 --> 00:48:24.631
My goodness.

00:48:24.715 --> 00:48:26.466
He scared me half to death.

00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:30.971
He's gone.

00:48:31.054 --> 00:48:31.888
You can come out now.

00:48:32.806 --> 00:48:33.807
Thank you.

00:48:43.358 --> 00:48:45.485
Here. Drink this.

00:48:55.746 --> 00:48:57.372
Why were you hiding from him?

00:48:59.624 --> 00:49:00.709
Is he a loan shark?

00:49:02.794 --> 00:49:03.837
I'm being nosy again.

00:49:04.379 --> 00:49:05.297
I'm sorry.

00:49:08.216 --> 00:49:09.468
Thank you.

00:49:14.931 --> 00:49:16.308
It's fine.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.518
You're okay now.

00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:20.437
You're okay.

00:49:35.202 --> 00:49:37.746
Da-rim, how are you feeling?

00:49:38.288 --> 00:49:39.998
It's cold medicine.

00:49:40.081 --> 00:49:41.708
Dae-seong put you through
so much yesterday.

00:49:41.792 --> 00:49:43.418
I feel so terrible.

00:49:43.502 --> 00:49:45.921
It's all right. I'm fine.

00:49:46.004 --> 00:49:47.714
If I weren't, I wouldn't be at work.

00:49:47.798 --> 00:49:51.301
You should've taken the day off.
No one would've said anything.

00:49:51.927 --> 00:49:53.970
Take the medicine. You might have a cold.

00:49:54.054 --> 00:49:57.432
But still, you shouldn't skip payday.

00:49:57.516 --> 00:50:00.560
Our paychecks are in!

00:50:00.644 --> 00:50:01.937
-Oh my.
-Hurry up and check.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.397
-Really?
-Hurry.

00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:05.440
This is amazing.

00:50:06.149 --> 00:50:07.859
MS. GO DA-RIM'S SALARY ACCOUNT
2,270,000 WON

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.531
Da-rim, are you crying?

00:50:12.614 --> 00:50:14.825
No, I'm not. Why would I be?

00:50:15.408 --> 00:50:16.743
I'm tearing up.

00:50:16.827 --> 00:50:18.411
I'm so touched.

00:50:19.496 --> 00:50:21.122
I mean, it'll all be gone later

00:50:21.206 --> 00:50:23.542
when I pay the overdue credit card bills
and loan payments,

00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:26.169
but I'm going to take it all in now
while I still can.

00:50:26.253 --> 00:50:27.087
You should.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.547
I'm going to buy myself something.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.423
I worked so hard this past month,

00:50:30.507 --> 00:50:32.384
so I deserve a nice treat.

00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:33.635
You mean multiple treats.

00:50:33.718 --> 00:50:35.178
Just look at all those packages.

00:50:35.262 --> 00:50:38.473
This time, I'm going to buy this.
Nan-suk, look.

00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:40.892
Is that seriously
meant to cover your body?

00:50:40.976 --> 00:50:44.062
Da-rim, look at this.
It'd look great on you. Buy it.

00:50:44.145 --> 00:50:45.272
I can't.

00:50:45.355 --> 00:50:47.649
I also have a lot of debt to pay off.

00:50:47.732 --> 00:50:49.192
You have loans too, huh?

00:50:49.734 --> 00:50:51.778
Then again, who doesn't?

00:50:54.406 --> 00:50:56.741
They gave us so much.

00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:18.263
It's the first payment, after all.

00:51:18.847 --> 00:51:21.057
Just giving him the money
doesn't feel right.

00:51:42.162 --> 00:51:42.996
Do you need something?

00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:46.166
Oh, it's nothing.

00:51:46.917 --> 00:51:49.044
Is Mr. Gong not in?

00:51:49.127 --> 00:51:50.170
He took a sick day.

00:51:50.253 --> 00:51:51.379
I think he has a bad cold.

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.340
Oh, really?

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.343
Is he feeling better now?

00:51:56.426 --> 00:51:59.596
He sounded pretty sick
when I called him earlier.

00:52:02.057 --> 00:52:04.768
Why do you ask?
Do you need something approved by him?

00:52:04.851 --> 00:52:06.770
No, I was just wondering.

00:52:20.659 --> 00:52:22.077
So that's what happened.

00:52:24.037 --> 00:52:24.996
Goodness me.

00:52:25.664 --> 00:52:28.208
How did you manage to endure
all those years?

00:52:29.334 --> 00:52:31.294
I didn't endure them.

00:52:33.046 --> 00:52:34.297
I just gave up.

00:52:36.299 --> 00:52:38.385
I was half out of my mind.

00:52:38.969 --> 00:52:40.679
I know it's not my place to say this,

00:52:41.304 --> 00:52:44.015
but you should've left with your son
and divorced your husband.

00:52:45.016 --> 00:52:46.059
My parents…

00:52:47.644 --> 00:52:50.313
were also relying on my husband.

00:52:52.357 --> 00:52:54.693
And the thought of living on my own…

00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:58.571
also scared me.

00:52:59.447 --> 00:53:00.323
I thought…

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.410
if I just put up with it,

00:53:05.412 --> 00:53:06.538
everyone

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.707
would be happy.

00:53:11.543 --> 00:53:12.460
"Happy"?

00:53:14.671 --> 00:53:15.964
Do you think

00:53:16.923 --> 00:53:21.261
your son was truly happy
watching you live like that?

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:24.264
Pardon?

00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:27.726
They say that parents
are the whole world to their kids.

00:53:28.685 --> 00:53:29.894
When a parent falls apart,

00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:33.815
the child's whole world crumbles.

00:53:35.817 --> 00:53:37.360
He must've been so scared.

00:53:38.111 --> 00:53:40.905
We have to become braver

00:53:42.073 --> 00:53:43.616
and happier

00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:46.077
for our children's sake.

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.872
That's what I think.

00:54:53.728 --> 00:54:55.814
Do you still resent me?

00:55:09.035 --> 00:55:10.495
It's been over 20 years.

00:55:10.578 --> 00:55:12.789
It's time for you to grow up already.

00:55:14.749 --> 00:55:15.917
Just because time has passed…

00:55:17.794 --> 00:55:19.420
doesn't mean it undoes what you've done.

00:55:20.463 --> 00:55:21.965
Are you blind to it all?

00:55:22.048 --> 00:55:23.675
My mom has lost her will to live.

00:55:24.259 --> 00:55:25.760
Your son doesn't believe in love.

00:55:26.594 --> 00:55:28.721
Don't you see the family you've destroyed?

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.184
It was true love.

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.311
I was just being true to my feelings.

00:55:38.148 --> 00:55:40.024
And people call that an affair.

00:55:40.775 --> 00:55:42.360
You know what disgusts me even more?

00:55:42.443 --> 00:55:44.779
Even after all that,
you hold your head high.

00:55:48.366 --> 00:55:50.618
You're talking
as if you're quite different from me.

00:55:50.702 --> 00:55:53.413
Then are you saying we're the same?

00:55:54.247 --> 00:55:55.790
Are you? How are we the same?

00:56:06.134 --> 00:56:06.968
Hey.

00:56:10.722 --> 00:56:13.183
You want that woman, don't you?

00:56:13.266 --> 00:56:14.684
You're dying to have her.

00:56:15.685 --> 00:56:18.521
You didn't even try to hide your feelings
in front of her husband.

00:56:20.106 --> 00:56:21.107
And you think…

00:56:23.026 --> 00:56:24.944
you have the right to criticize me?

00:56:29.282 --> 00:56:30.783
You and I are the same.

00:56:32.076 --> 00:56:33.077
Don't you see that?

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.551
SEON-U

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:09.048
I'm going to buy some meat on my way home.

00:58:09.132 --> 00:58:10.383
-Are you?
-What are you having for dinner?

00:58:10.466 --> 00:58:12.635
I want to spend some quality time
with my family.

00:58:12.719 --> 00:58:13.928
I should ask my kids.

00:58:14.012 --> 00:58:15.346
-All right.
-Bye, everyone.

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:16.598
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

00:58:16.681 --> 00:58:17.682
-Get home safely.
-Have a nice evening.

00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:19.183
-Good job today.
-See you tomorrow.

00:58:22.395 --> 00:58:24.022
Excuse me, Mr. Kang.

00:58:24.105 --> 00:58:25.106
Yes, Ms. Go?

00:58:25.189 --> 00:58:28.192
Can I get Mr. Gong's address?

00:58:28.985 --> 00:58:29.819
What for?

00:58:30.403 --> 00:58:33.197
I can't help but think he got sick
because of me,

00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:35.617
so I thought I'd get him some porridge
on my way home.

00:58:39.954 --> 00:58:40.788
You're so thoughtful.

00:58:42.498 --> 00:58:43.458
One second.

00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:22.955
Did he go out somewhere?

00:59:46.979 --> 00:59:48.106
What are you doing here?

00:59:49.607 --> 00:59:52.902
I heard you were sick,
so I thought I'd bring you this.

00:59:52.985 --> 00:59:53.945
It's porridge.

00:59:54.821 --> 00:59:58.449
If you already had dinner,
you can heat it up and have it later.

00:59:58.533 --> 01:00:01.119
-If you put it in the fridge--
-How did you know where I live?

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:04.372
It's incredibly rude
to show up unannounced.

01:00:06.624 --> 01:00:07.750
I'm sorry.

01:00:09.752 --> 01:00:11.921
I didn't call
because I didn't want to disturb you,

01:00:12.004 --> 01:00:13.423
but I did send you a text.

01:00:20.346 --> 01:00:21.514
I just thought…

01:00:22.974 --> 01:00:25.017
having someone check in on you
when you're sick

01:00:26.561 --> 01:00:30.189
could maybe provide some comfort
and strength.

01:00:34.026 --> 01:00:35.194
Does your husband…

01:00:37.488 --> 01:00:39.157
know you're here?

01:00:44.328 --> 01:00:45.163
Pardon?

01:00:45.246 --> 01:00:47.457
A man lives here alone.

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:51.210
What would people say
if they saw you here?

01:00:53.004 --> 01:00:54.714
Don't cross the line.

01:00:59.844 --> 01:01:00.720
Wait.

01:01:00.803 --> 01:01:04.182
If you don't want the porridge,
there's also medicine…

01:01:05.475 --> 01:01:07.435
and this month's payment in here.

01:01:07.518 --> 01:01:09.145
Today was payday.

01:01:09.937 --> 01:01:11.397
That's also why

01:01:12.148 --> 01:01:15.526
I wanted to see you in person
and thank you.

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.320
I had no other intentions.

01:01:19.906 --> 01:01:20.782
I'm sorry.

01:01:24.994 --> 01:01:27.413
I'll get going now.

01:01:51.354 --> 01:01:52.355
I'm…

01:01:52.939 --> 01:01:54.190
not a good person.

01:01:54.774 --> 01:01:55.608
Sorry?

01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:58.653
I'm also swayed.

01:02:03.366 --> 01:02:05.576
A man lives here alone.

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:08.913
What would people say
if they saw you here?

01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:10.373
Don't cross the line.

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.236
Ji-hyeok.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.863
What are you talking about?

01:03:26.657 --> 01:03:27.909
I want to get married

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:30.536
as soon as possible.

01:03:58.105 --> 01:04:03.027
DYNAMITE KISS

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.934
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

01:04:35.017 --> 01:04:36.018
Is this because of Go Da-rim?

01:04:36.102 --> 01:04:37.103
You're the one who's lost your mind.

01:04:37.186 --> 01:04:38.646
Why do you make me worry?

01:04:38.729 --> 01:04:40.940
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

01:04:41.023 --> 01:04:42.108
Can't you get your act together?

01:04:42.191 --> 01:04:44.902
I told you there was nothing between us.

01:04:44.986 --> 01:04:48.364
I just need to work as a team member
with him as the team leader. That's it.

01:04:48.447 --> 01:04:50.157
I'm a pro!

01:04:50.741 --> 01:04:51.742
It's okay.

01:04:51.826 --> 01:04:52.868
It's my job.

01:04:52.952 --> 01:04:54.704
You're here to make money,
not to play around.

01:04:55.246 --> 01:04:57.331
If something like this ever happens again,

01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:59.750
I'll kill you with my own hands.

01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:02.128
You don't know anything.
This is just a misunderstanding.

01:05:02.211 --> 01:05:03.212
A misunderstanding?

01:05:03.295 --> 01:05:06.007
Then tell me. What do I not know?

01:05:06.507 --> 01:05:10.928
