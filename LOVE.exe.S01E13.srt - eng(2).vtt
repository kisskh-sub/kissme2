00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.179
(This is a work of fiction. All names, characters, )

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.409
(and incidents are products of the author's imagination.)

(All child actors were accompanied by a guardian, )

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.710
(and filmed in accordance with labour laws.)

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.990
Did he just bail?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.060
(LOVE.exe, Episode 13: Blind Date)

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.030
A lot happened this past week.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.730
Lee Soo Min and I broke up.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.739
Is it for real this time?

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.069
Or is it just another one of your temporary breakups,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.209
like the last 1,800 times?

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.640
This time it's for real.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.009
I'll believe it when I see it.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.340
It's still so vivid how I trusted what you said,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.579
talked behind her back, and everything blew up in my face.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.349
- Then I even suggested... - Kang Dong Won dumped...

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.150
her scary girlfriend. I didn't need to ask why.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.889
- Yoo Ri. - Still...

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.220
I didn't even say anything, and she'd just tell me to shut up.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.790
So for the amount of dialogue between two users...

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.190
Meanwhile, San has been on top of her game lately.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.800
That way, we can reduce server load even during high-traffic weekends.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.630
She says she can focus better now that she has a clear goal.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.200
If we finish development by then, we can test before the competition.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.070
All this in just two days?

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.210
Great work. Here, eat while you work. Go on.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.279
- You're in beast mode these days. - Yes.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.950
I must win the competition to move into a soundproof apartment.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.380
- Soundproofing? That's so random. - Soundproofing is important.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.090
Kang Min Hak was already doing well, but he's been blowing up lately.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.930
What? The commercial's out.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.260
Man, it's so weird. It's like he's from another world.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.400
Didn't he get cast in a movie, too?

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.429
We won't see him around anymore.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.930
Hasn't he missed ten days of school?

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.700
- That Konjac Special looks so good. - Konjac?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.639
Forget that. At times like this, we can use...

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.210
the gift card Min Hak dropped in the group chat...

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.610
He sent another gift card?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.080
- For chicken? - Let's get the Konjac Special.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.380
It looks pretty good.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020
All right.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.059
Jinny and Timothy have already broken up.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.360
They really live in a different world.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.060
They break up as fast as they date. You can't tell what's real or fake.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.860
At this rate, they'll get back together in five minutes.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.569
I heard rumours that Timothy was abusive.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.670
Really?

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.500
I'll call you later.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.900
Okay.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.920
(Ten days earlier)

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320
You came by yourself?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.020
What on earth are you doing all the way out here?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.390
Why was your phone off?

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.860
What?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.430
I waited for you to finish.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.030
Follow that car, please.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.240
You just took off, so of course, I followed you.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840
What?

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.210
Min Hak.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240
Are you over me already and seeing someone else?

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.420
Hey, let's go downstairs and talk.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.850
- Hey, wait a second. - Let me just...

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.990
(Smooth Taste, Like Dew)

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.120
You left this.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.420
Okay.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.860
This is...

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.130
Is that me?

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.630
Why is that here?

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.700
Well...

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.540
It's kind of a long story. I asked her to hold on to it for me.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.070
- But... - Quiz King?

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.480
You're her, right? The one with the messed-up laptop.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.349
You go to Min Hak's school.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.150
And here I was thinking...

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.990
It's nice to meet you. I never thought we'd meet like this.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.430
Do you know me?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.960
Of course. You have no idea how grateful I am.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.030
Jinny.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.870
What are you doing?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.640
- Right. This was a secret. - No...

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.440
I must be drunk.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.270
My head's starting to hurt a little.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.639
- What's going on? - The walls are thin here.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.350
We have to keep it down or else people will complain.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.209
- San, I'm so sorry. I'll... - Hey...

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.120
- Jinny, we need to go. - Hold on.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.650
- No, we can't stay here. - I'll just rest a bit, then go.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.790
- Come on. - You've got the wrong house.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.289
- I just feel really sick. - We have to go.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.190
Why don't you two take it inside before I get kicked out too?

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.430
- No. Why would we go in? - Sounds good to me.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.200
She is so cool. I like her.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.070
- Hey, why are you going in there? - Sorry to barge in.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.940
Should this come in with us?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.810
This is insane.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.240
Sorry to barge in.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.180
Sorry to barge in.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.890
It's cosy in here.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.059
Your studio is really nice.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.860
I've always wanted to live in a space like this.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.730
San, you don't have to do all this for me.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.730
Don't flatter yourself.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.430
It's the fastest way to sober her up and get her home, so stay out of it.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.330
That's right, Min Hak.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.070
Don't get in her way.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.900
Come here.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.610
Give me your manager's number. I'll text him your location.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.780
All right. Just sit down for a second.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.190
- Okay? - What? Why?

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.690
Stay with me tonight.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.660
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.430
I'm telling you, I can't go home tonight.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.730
Someone's there.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.140
Is that supposed to be a whisper?

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.270
Who?

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.010
Ouch, my hand.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480
Don't tell me.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.110
Timothy?

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.250
What?

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.519
By the way,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.689
were you faking the whole group project thing...

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.359
this whole time with the Quiz King?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.490
Jinny!

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.269
All for me? To stop the bad press?

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.400
Please, keep your voice down.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.140
Just give me your manager's number.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.410
But I don't want to team up with anyone else.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.650
I want to do this with you, San.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.220
And, San...

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.960
out of everyone I know,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.120
you're the least ordinary person.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.540
If you've sobered up,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.470
you can see yourself out.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.370
And it looks like you have someone to stay with you tonight.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.950
I feel like I'm always in your debt.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.110
Thank you.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.520
- Always? - San, I'm so sorry,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.420
but I'll take her home and be right back.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.690
You're coming back? Here? Why?

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.130
And leave your girlfriend?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360
Min Hak.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.130
Did you tell her about us?

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.730
San, about that...

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.869
That time at the Yongsan hotel,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.870
and when you had me hold on to that cutout,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.840
I put two and two together.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.139
However, I heard Jinny was seeing someone,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.410
so I assumed you two broke up.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.980
- You're right. We broke up, but... - So was what she just said true?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.490
- What? - The part about us teaming up...

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.160
Was that all just to stop the press from writing about you and her?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.090
Sorry, my bad.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.060
I tried to pretend I didn't hear it, but it was a little too loud.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.330
So we were just being used?

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.270
I'm sorry,

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.910
- but I'll explain when I get back. - Don't bother.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.080
I think I've got the gist of it.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.150
So what are you still standing there for?

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.290
Don't tell me you have more to say.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.990
Min Hak. I know a thing or two about situations like this.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.690
The polite thing to do right now is to leave.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.460
"Manners maketh man."

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.000
Sorry for the intrusion.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.740
Min Hak, come on.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.620
That went completely sideways. Right?

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.460
I was just fishing for a reaction.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.489
Did Joo Yeon San really like Kang Min Hak?

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.230
That's a bit of a stretch.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.190
Maybe it's because of our app, Split Alarm?

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.600
What?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.999
I mean, we're making a dating app, right?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.429
- Yes. - But Joo Yeon San herself...

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.199
is maybe trying to break through...

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.900
the limits of never being in a relationship?

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.210
So this blind date is some kind of simulation?

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.640
What kind of guy should we set her up with?

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.610
I'm the one who brought it up, but I have no idea where to start.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.919
It is awkward, though. The thought of Joo Yeon San...

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.950
with a guy...

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.520
I bet her standards are crazy high, too.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.990
Her ideal type might not even be human.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.090
Totally.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.790
Hey, get out of the way!

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.760
- No, just a second. - Seriously.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.560
- Na Rae, go ahead. I'll catch up. - Okay.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.270
What's going on?

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.930
Can you give me a hand?

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.210
What a jerk. He could've stopped to help.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.910
Are you okay?

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.219
I came this way to avoid the curb,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.780
but I didn't know it was blocked too.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.290
That was so frustrating. Can I buy you a coffee?

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.960
How come you're not having any?

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.860
I'm not really thirsty.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.560
Actually, that's not it. I don't drink coffee.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.470
Going to the bathroom is difficult for me.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.640
I don't really drink beer either.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.300
I just pretend to.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.780
(Yoo Ri: Free beer at Manseon Pub at the back gate)

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.280
Is this spam or what?

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.880
Then why did you ask me to meet you at Manseon Pub?

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.050
I wasn't sure how to ask someone out on a date.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.260
I was kind of interested in you.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.759
But things are a little complicated.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.230
We're both women, and I'm disabled.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.160
But I still wanted to talk to you.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.870
I didn't know how, so I stole a line other people use and tried it.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.500
It didn't really work, though.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.469
Anyway, don't feel pressured.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.640
It wasn't a huge crush or anything.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.640
Really?

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.520
Besides, it seemed like you were already seeing someone.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.720
So, how about we just be friends?

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.060
But if that makes you uncomfortable, I understand.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.030
Being friends would be difficult.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.000
Since I'm older than you.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.800
When did you find out?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.470
From the start.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.740
I see.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.980
And I'm not seeing anyone.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.380
We broke up.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.610
I see.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.550
I guess my information was a little outdated.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.590
You should've made an announcement or something.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.230
Why was it always so hard for us to talk?

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.030
You're wrong. We never had a conversation.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.099
Then tell me anything.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.570
I promise I'll really listen this time.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.210
I don't have anything left to say.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.210
Then it's my turn.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.150
Let's get back together.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.010
I don't have any confidence in us anymore.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.820
I'll do better.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.820
My heart's not in it anymore.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.960
Then I'll have enough heart for the both of us.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.230
I'll keep my heart pure.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.500
I will dream a sweet dream.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.300
I'll dream of us, alone in a small room as we used to,

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.740
just talking softly to each other.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.540
Okay?

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.210
That heart...

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.680
will need time to tell.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.519
- That was so good! - Thanks.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.320
My heart was pounding so hard I almost said, "Let's try again."

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.390
- I actually teared up. - You too?

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.130
Where was it again? That part at the end was so sad.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.430
Your emotional acting has improved in just one week.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.770
It's like you've been through a lot, and it's helping you grow, you know?

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.040
I want to do well this time.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.270
The elevators here are really slow.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.740
Looks like the elevators are all moving at once.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.550
You see how all the elevators bunch up on one floor,

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.780
while people on other floors are left waiting?

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.389
Apparently, it's because they're using the wrong algorithm.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.449
What?

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.420
Figuring out the most efficient way for elevators to work together...

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.960
is also something that developers do.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.930
Min Hak, you know so many interesting things.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.200
I don't really know the details. Someone just told me.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.330
I peed waiting for an elevator when I was a kid.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.570
Me too!

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.739
I was in 7th grade at that time.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.740
I was at the hospital, and my floor's bathroom was broken.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.610
So I had no choice but to wait.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.380
Come on, Teacher. You're joking, right?

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.710
If that algorithm optimization had been in place...

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.509
Yeon San, you're still up for a blind date, right?

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.880
What's your type?

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.320
Anyway, I guess in the end, it all comes down to timing, right?

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.920
When you should be running down the stairs,

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.389
but instead just wait for the elevator,

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.490
you'll be too late.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.790
That's the moral of the story, right?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.670
- That was the group chat. Sorry. - Na Rae, why in the group chat?

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.040
(Yang Na Rae: That was the group chat. Sorry.)

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.100
What?

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.170
What was she trying to say?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.619
- Should I just floor it? - Yeon San, where are you?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.620
Check my private messages.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.350
Come to the lounge so we can finish the Frontend, Backend integration.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.490
- How was Business Admin? - Gosh, why Business Admin?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.290
Darn it!

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.430
Hey! Use your signal before you cut in!

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.740
Hey, why aren't you answering me? I said, tell me your type.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.610
What are you talking about? I'm trying to code while holding it.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.880
What do you mean? I agonize over yours more than mine.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.790
Na Rae, are you trying to make up for your recent breakup...

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.259
by turning my love life into your little matchmaking project?

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.260
What?

00:15:56.261 --> 00:15:59.330
I get it, but I'm in no condition to be the focus of your projection.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.070
Hey, Joo Yeon San. That's going too far, even for you.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.340
Hey, where are you? Don't you move. I've had just about enough of you.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.340
I wonder if that would be too harsh.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.140
If you're that free, just get over to the lounge. Let's just work.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.280
Joo Yeon San, you always kept dating and relationships at arm's length.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.319
So for your very first blind date...

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.450
If you think of it as a game, it's like the free trial.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.920
And as the planner, I'll provide you with a proper Tutorial Mode.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.090
A Tutorial Mode? Give me a break.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.360
Just tell me. First off, what kind of guy do you want?

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.660
No, let's do it by process of elimination instead.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.830
"I could never date guys like that." Let's start with those.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.200
Your absolute turn-offs.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.870
If I have to name some...

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.110
(Ten days earlier)

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.450
Min Hak!

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.620
Hurry, get in.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.030
A guy who bails on group projects for personal reasons.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.760
A guy who bails on a joint development project.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.770
An indecisive guy. I hate that.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:14.000
Or someone who hides things from the very beginning?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.920
Most of all,

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.490
someone who has no intention of joining a project from the start,

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.860
but convinces you to join anyway,

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.200
and then makes all your hard work feel completely pointless.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.000
A person who...

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.200
makes you second-guess everything.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.570
And...

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.410
like a piece of code stuck in an infinite recursion,

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.210
a guy who keeps going back to his old flame.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.460
(Kang Min Hak)

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.630
(Block Caller)

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.160
(Block Contact)

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.980
I must have dozed off.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.010
Where are we?

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.980
The parking lot at my university.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.020
- Your university? - I answered your ringing phone.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.720
It was your manager.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.260
- He's on his way. - Why? I want to be with you.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.830
I heard from your manager that...

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.900
your new boyfriend...

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.200
isn't in the country right now.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.670
I must have gotten something wrong, right?

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.240
Or you were just trying to mislead me?

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.510
Does that really matter?

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.980
Let's just go to your place. I'll explain everything.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.280
That's not who we are anymore.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.590
- I guess we can't do this anymore. - Don't.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.260
Or this? How about this?

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.590
Stop it. I'm not playing around.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.530
I'm not seeing you anymore.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.100
We're over.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.040
Over?

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.510
Why?

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.480
Am I a joke to you now?

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.880
Because I'm not as popular, my international debut failed,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.780
and I'm not as glamorous and successful as I used to be,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.420
am I no longer useful to you?

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.030
I never thought you were all that glamorous.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.500
- What? - From the moment we first met,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.200
I felt sorry for you.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.000
You already shine so brightly.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.610
You have so much to lose, so you're scared.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.540
Seeing you try so hard was just...

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.120
That's why I always wanted to be there for you.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.890
That's why I like you so much.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.290
Always taking responsibility,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.490
it's so sweet.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.760
Unlike your dad.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.370
- I'm just like my dad! - No, Min Hak.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.540
You're nothing like your dad.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.970
I meant you.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.040
I'm saying you're the one who's like my dad.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480
What?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.750
Someone who pities themselves more than anyone else in the world.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.790
And takes those who love and wait for them...

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.190
for granted.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.990
I like Joo Yeon San.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.729
I came here so I could tell you this once you'd sobered up.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.070
Stop it. I don't want to hear it.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.670
And honestly, even while I'm here with you,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.439
all I can think about is San.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.110
I already know, so just stop.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.680
I know I was awful to you.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.250
But that's not why you're leaving me.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.680
I'm not asking you to forgive me,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.850
and I'm not asking you to understand.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820
It's just...

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
Just...

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.630
I want you to know that I really did like you.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.230
I mean it.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.140
You can go now.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.310
Now we're both going where we belong based on our values.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.210
You to your place, and me to mine.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.680
Can you leave the car keys?

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.120
You're still drunk.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.130
Come on, I need to turn the heater on.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.329
You finally picked up.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.230
Min Hak, I'm sorry about buying the Maybach.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.540
I'll even make the payments, so please tell me where it is, okay?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.470
- You're a terrible parker, Min Hak. - Jinny's in your car.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.840
What? Jinny? You're seeing Jinny again?

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.539
The car? Where is it?

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.780
I parked it at Hangang University's parking lot.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.180
- I'm leaving the keys... - What? The keys?

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.619
Under the table in the gazebo.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.290
Find it and take Jinny home.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.020
What about you?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.360
I have somewhere to be.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:35.690
Hey, Min Hak.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.270
San.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.970
I'm really sorry about earlier.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.170
I know what you're thinking.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.840
But I already broke up with her,

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.440
and I couldn't just leave her there.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.380
It's too dangerous for her to be out at night,

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.379
and if I left her in a crowd...

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.190
Well, she's kind of famous,

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.690
plus she'd had a lot to drink.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.420
So I really didn't have a choice, you see.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.730
San.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.460
Look...

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.200
You're really mad, aren't you?

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.800
But you're right.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.240
At first,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.369
I had an ulterior motive when I joined the team.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.640
But now...

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.210
It's not like that.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.210
But everything that happened after I got to know you...

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.479
has been genuine.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.419
Nothing else mattered to me. I really mean it.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.390
It's okay, brother. It's too late for this.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.190
What time is it? It's getting so late.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.780
San! I...

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.310
Whatever it is, don't. Just don't do it, okay?

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.980
Okay.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.730
Where have you been?

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.790
I just had to get something at the convenience store.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.060
- What about you? - I came to see you...

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.500
to apologise.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.400
Apologise?

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.800
For how things turned out,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.070
and for Jinny ending up here.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.710
I know how this all looks,

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.450
and since you're not entirely wrong,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.850
I wanted to apologise for that, too.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120
It's fine.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.160
What?

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.460
I was...

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.390
mad, yes. I even ran the calculations.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.330
Calculations?

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.200
(One hour earlier)

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.610
First, it's not Kang Min Hak's fault that he entered the competition.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.450
To be precise, he's not completely blameless.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.550
I insisted we team up,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.289
and after that, Min Hak was genuinely committed to it.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.690
He came up with key ideas, too.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.330
Therefore, that fault is considered nullified.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.800
However, Jinny showing up was not exactly pleasant.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.170
Jinny showed up on her own. Kang Min Hak didn't summon her.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.080
However, whether Kang Min Hak is truly sincere with me...

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.310
is another, unrelated variable.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.850
Wait. Before that, how is sincerity defined,

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.050
and what data can quantify it?

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.750
At the end of the day,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.120
Kang Min Hak's final action here was to follow Jinny out.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.329
Base the conclusion on his actions,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.260
the vector of his choices.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.600
Therefore.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.900
For the record, the resulting value...

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.970
is minus 188 on our Split Alarm index.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.140
I don't know what that means, but it sounds like a very bad score.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.390
This is all wrong. We're done for.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.520
If you eliminate everyone, who is left for me to set you up with?

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.690
I know. I guess I got carried away by what you were saying.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.800
I guess my usual vibe suits me better after all.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.930
Each must survive on their own.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.470
Gosh.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.980
Don't rush.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.710
But don't be late.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.680
(Ten days earlier)

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.290
Can you just give me one chance to explain?

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.590
To put it in terms of our competition prep,

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.590
like the final pitch.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.160
I've prepared two versions.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.500
One incorporates what I've learned from you these past few months.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.700
The other is just my old way,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.540
the kind of ignorant, unfiltered version.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.810
Go on.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.210
Still,

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.290
I'll choose the one you like more, the one I put more thought into.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.050
If you insist.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520
All right.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.690
First of all,

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.030
I tried to see it your way, San.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.860
And from that point of view,

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.900
I must seem pathetic and ridiculous to you right now, right?

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.600
Because in the 21st century, running to confess your feelings...

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.810
is the exact kind of cheesy rom-com trope you hate.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.880
Did I really say that?

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:05.620
Yes, you did.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.620
Why in moments like these, just like in this script,

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.160
do rom-coms always have the lead run while some dramatic music plays?

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.290
It heightens the emotions and makes it more entertaining.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.330
Do people really find that immersive?

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.230
It's the 21st century. They can just send a DM or call.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.300
If they're going to meet in person, they can just call an Uber.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.830
You're right. At a crucial moment in their career,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.970
and of course, it's always a few hours before a flight,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.140
and they drop everything they are doing to run to their ex...

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.080
We writers feel a little guilty about that one.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.780
Trying to create an emotional moment like that is so dated...

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.520
Come on, without moments like that, is it even a romance?

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.190
It's like saying, "I truly love you, even if it hurts my career."

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.960
That's the heart of these youth romances.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.990
If I built an AI specialising in romantic comedies,

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.760
I'd write scenes like that completely differently.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.170
What's more constant than a fickle romance,

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:01.100
and what truly defines who we are, is our work, isn't it?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.670
Like my coding.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.280
How do you remember every single thing I said?

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.150
Your memory's better than I thought.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.250
I don't know. Maybe I'm not in my right mind,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.620
and I'm just rambling.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.650
But one thing's for sure.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.860
Some people still don't check DMs and don't even have social media,

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.560
people like you.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.600
And there really are spots and times you can't get an Uber,

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.629
and times when your phone battery is about to die...

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.400
that you really have to save to make that one call.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.840
So even though I knew you'd call me a fool...

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.270
and call it irrational,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.840
I had no choice but to come running.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.979
And on my way here, I called my brother...

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.880
and changed my flight to tomorrow afternoon.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.549
So I won't inconvenience anyone.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.020
That way, the carbon footprint...

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.220
that would've increased from all the cancellations...

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.360
would be reduced.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.260
Honestly, for my usual self,

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.970
using my brain to near-overload and talking this fast is a lot.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.000
But the only reason I'm trying this hard...

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.540
is entirely because of you, San.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.080
I just want to be with you,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.510
and...

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.450
I want to change your mind.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.850
(Hangang University)

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.230
(Boot Camp Now Recruiting)

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.030
Actually,

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.830
I looked up the first airport bus this morning, too.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.600
You did?

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.430
- Why? - To see you.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.240
But then I realised going to the airport was irrational.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.240
I mean, how would I even find you in that huge airport?

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.350
Would calling your name do anything when you're off to Thailand?

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.279
Do I just tell you to get off the plane?

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.050
How stupid would that be?

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.990
So I told myself to just sleep on it.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.320
And figured when you got back, Min Hak,

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.930
we could get in touch and talk things over then.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.790
That was the plan, anyway.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:17.000
But before I knew it, there I was, outside.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.140
So what were you going to say when I got back?

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.310
What, to "settle our accounts?"

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.040
Settle our accounts?

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.310
Yes.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.580
You're full of surprises today, Kang Min Hak.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.850
I'm surprised you know old sayings like that.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.120
No, wait. That's not the correct phrase for this.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.660
I meant "company liquidation."

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.730
It's a term for when companies part ways.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.000
You know, for celebrities with agencies.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:57.010
- I guess I was wrong? - Whatever.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.140
What was the cheesy version supposed to be?

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.580
It's...

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.250
I don't care about anything, I just...

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.520
You're just so pretty, San.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.190
You're so pretty that I just had to see you right away.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:19.500
I wanted to kiss you again and hug you. You know?

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.730
I wanted to go to school with you and everything.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.270
Pretty cheesy?

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.640
How did you get here so fast?

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440
Because I missed...

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:09.950
I missed you so much that I really stepped on it.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.580
I was averaging 55.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.280
- 55? - Yes.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.350
You're a real speed demon.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.450
- Why didn't you answer your phone? - My phone?

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.460
It must be in my bag.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:25.630
And what's this about some random blind date?

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.230
Kang Dong Won and Yang Na Rae kept getting suspicious,

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600
so it just happened.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.900
You weren't really planning to go, were you?

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:36.870
You're laughing?

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.310
- Hey, no way. - Ever heard of superposition?

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.710
- State of what? - Look it up. You're an engineer.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.520
Come on, can't we just tell Na Rae and Dong Won about us?

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.460
- Can I kiss you? - Are you crazy? No.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.989
Hello, everyone. During lunch...

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.059
So while you were gone, Min Hak,

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.060
we made good progress on Split Alarm.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.670
Actually, Joo Yeon San did pretty much everything.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.570
But we did our part, ordering food and cheering San on.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.010
- She's right. - Really?

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.610
You all worked hard.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.410
Yes.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.320
(Ji Sung Hall Two)

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.390
- Joo Yeon San. - Yes?

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.620
Kang Min Hak.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.190
Yes?

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.220
You two are acting weird.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.890
- What? - What?

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.589
What do you mean?

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.160
Why? What do you mean?

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.500
Did you two fight again?

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.500
I'm so sick of this.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.569
- No. - No, of course not.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:39.770
Why would we?

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.740
Then why are you ignoring each other again?

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.840
You're not even making eye contact right now.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.240
The competition's almost over, and you're still acting like this?

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.280
Especially you, Joo Yeon San. Be the mature one for once.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.110
What did I do?

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.050
Okay, you two. Face each other.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.390
Go on.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.260
- Hold hands. - What?

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.130
Shake hands and make up.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.800
Repeat after me.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.440
From now on, let's not fight and just get along.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.310
Let's get along.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.210
Fine.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.390
Now that's settled, let's grab lunch and then go to the special lecture.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.790
- What special lecture? - Didn't you see the notice?

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.759
The special lecture's this afternoon,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760
and it counts for attendance.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.700
But...

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.300
Shoot. I don't think I can. I have plans later.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.670
It's a CompSci lecture anyway, so you're good.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:51.140
Wait, if you have plans, why are you on campus today?

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.080
It's just... Well...

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.150
Actually, I can't make it today either.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.880
How come?

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.450
I just can't.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.860
Besides, these lectures are a waste, you know?

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:07.290
Joo Yeon San?

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.660
You're Joo Yeon San, right?

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.930
I knew it. It's me, Chang Yi. Park Chang Yi.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.200
You don't remember me?

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.740
Yes, of course, I remember you.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.610
It's been such a long time.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.080
What are the odds of running into you here?

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:32.820
I know, right?
