(Special Lecture:
Deep Learning for a Big Tech Career)

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.650
After graduating from KAIST,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.459
I joined a big tech company that
I'm sure you all know,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.520
where I was a software engineer
for about two years.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.290
But I found a field in deep learning
I was passionate about researching.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.800
So the next semester,
I joined a research lab at CMU.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.170
It might sound impressive,
but it's really nothing special.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.610
- Any of you can do the same.
- I got to use the restroom.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.620
It all started with games and apps
I made back in high school.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.920
The little things, you know?

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.420
- That's when I got hooked on...
- I wonder what their story is.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.790
Is what ultimately led me
to deep learning.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.129
Did you see Yeon San's look at him?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.829
And the way he looks at her...

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.400
tells me there's totally
a story there.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.630
So today, I'd like to talk about
the research I'm passionate about...

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
I heard they just went to
high school together.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.440
That's just something people say.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.240
It's sort of like when celebs say
they're just close friends...

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.180
or just know each other from school.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.239
- Hello everyone.
- Right.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.409
- Exactly.
- Welcome to deep learning.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.080
Right. You were away,
so you might not know.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.950
Get this, San asked me
to set her up with someone.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.050
What is deep learning?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.160
Really?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.890
Don't you think this is,
like, a sign?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960
The day a man enters her life
is finally here.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.100
It's advantageous to learn.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.970
We learn from experience.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.230
- But...
- Yes?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.840
So, what you're saying...

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.710
is someone like Park Chang Yi...

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.380
A real catch who's well-spoken,
smart, sharp, and good-looking.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.080
Voice assistance like Siri...

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.050
- All right.
- ChatGPT.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.320
Is a guy like that
really San's type?

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.050
- He's my type.
- What?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.520
But I bet San would like him too.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.990
I doubt it.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.530
- You don't really know San.
- Exactly.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.929
Hey, Na Rae, you...

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.700
said the same thing
when we first did our group project.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.870
Right. I did, but...

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.040
Didn't you say you had plans?
So why are you at a CompSci lecture?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.580
I just thought it might be
helpful for me too.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.750
Knowledge is power, right?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.950
I feel powerful.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.660
(LOVE.exe,
Episode 14: The Career Seminar)

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.690
Hey, Ban Ji No keeps
calling to join us.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.330
Seriously?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.100
Anyway, it's such an honour
to have you here.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.340
But didn't you say
you had something to do?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.139
Shouldn't you get going?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.940
- You said you pushed it back once.
- Oh...

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.140
I pushed it to tomorrow.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.680
Besides, this is kind of
a team dinner,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.180
so it wouldn't be right
if I skipped out.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.120
This isn't a team dinner.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.220
- What?
- I just came for the chicken.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.720
I was just thirsty.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.430
Whatever, I'm thirsty too.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.030
Of course, I'm also here to find out
what the deal is with you two,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.200
exchanging such soulful looks.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.600
And maybe get a little dopamine rush
from the drama?

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.470
What are you talking about?
It's not like that.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.510
So, Min Hak, is your major
in this field?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.719
No, I'm in
the Department of Modelling.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.049
- I see.
- Yes.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.220
He's actually super famous.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.420
Please...

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.860
Because of a ridiculous
department merger,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.330
we all ended up on one team
for the competition.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.300
You mean the Hangang University
President's Cup App Contest?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.830
Yes.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.230
So you're in it too.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.710
Right. I was going to mention this
while we were all together,

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.940
but I can't be there
for the competition's final pitch.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.380
What are you talking about?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.410
The committee-school fight blew up.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.320
You all saw the posts on Everytime.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.390
"Why is the girl objecting to
the merger in a school contest?"

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.050
But still,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.089
you can't just drop out like this.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.890
No way. We're not letting you.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.029
I'm not dropping out.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.030
I'll just keep my name on the roster
for the rule.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.700
I just need to avoid
being in the spotlight.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.900
I don't know
your individual situations,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.710
but if winning the prize money
is your main objective,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.310
there are other ways to do business
without entering the competition.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.679
The prize money might seem
like a lot to you,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.150
but it's nothing to a large company.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.150
If the idea has mass appeal,
it'll be an easy sell.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.490
In that case, would you take a look
at our app, Split Alarm?

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.420
We're in the final stages
of development.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.360
Did you guys talk
about this already?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.270
I'd be honoured.
But I'm supposed to be a judge.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.600
Nothing's set, but if you're serious
about business, not competing,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.770
then of course, I'll help.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.110
I can even introduce you to people
in my network.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.840
- Really?
- Of course. Anything for San.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.550
Excuse me!

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.530
Can we get five more beers?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.710
I don't remember asking you
for a favour...

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.310
We'd be incredibly grateful.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.350
I can't believe we're treating you
to just chicken and beer on campus.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.650
What are you talking about?
This is on me.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.850
Just getting to see San again
is more than enough for me.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.620
Gosh, excuse me!

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.060
Can we get some more chicken, too?

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.900
I'm just really hungry.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.640
And of course,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.440
I'm paying for it.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.639
Goodness.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.850
Next time,
just press the call button.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.950
Okay.

(Youth Pub)

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.920
Really? You two must be
so happy to see each other.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.590
Wait a minute.
So you two went to school together?

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.700
San and I didn't actually
go to school at the same time.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.460
I graduated early,
after my sophomore year.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.600
KAIST. That figures.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.670
When I returned for homecoming,
San was just a freshman.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.400
So how did you two get close?

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.840
- At camp.
- At camp. Gosh.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.380
It was just a regular science camp
run by the school.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.739
That, and there was...

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.010
also a mentoring program
with alumni...

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.880
called
the Career Exploration Program.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.420
And San was brilliant in it.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.589
Remember how your team used...

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.250
Kinematic AI
for the Deep Learning project?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.920
That was such a grind.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.030
We had to take
a 500-megabyte raw data CSV file...

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.000
and manually sift through it all
to create the training data.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.800
You were really incredible.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.630
Wait, so are you two...

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.570
Are you sure you're okay with
not entering the competition?

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.770
Well, for me,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.110
I'll be happy as long as
all your hard work pays off somehow.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.180
Right.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.579
- Split Alarm.
- What are you working on now?

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.980
Should we really consider
talking to him about it?

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.980
He seems like a good guy.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.220
Then I guess it all worked out.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.690
But it's because you were so sharp
that you finished in time.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.689
If it hadn't been for you,
your team probably would've...

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.600
spent the entire camp
just clicking at their computers.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.769
The one where instead
of image training,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.030
we tracked
the movement of the boxes...

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.900
and trained that as
time-series data, right?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.210
If I'd known what a beast
working with raw data was,

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.810
I would've picked a different topic.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.040
What are they even talking about?

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.580
How would I know?
It's Science High School talk.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.050
- Their past?
- No, Science High.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.650
They are Science High prodigies.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.220
This is the first time I've heard
San talk about that time.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.990
She's practically glowing.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.270
This is so inspiring.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.210
I have a web novel idea I shelved
because I was totally stuck.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.839
It’s about a senior and a junior
who happen to meet again...

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.150
by chance after graduation.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.050
- You write web novels?
- Yes.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.279
These guys are total techies,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.420
but I only got into CompSci because
I heard getting a job was easy.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.660
But that's ancient history now,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.760
and besides,
it wasn't a good fit for me.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.659
So I figured I might as well
use my CompSci background...

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.990
and try my hand at writing.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.100
Do you happen to know
a company called Yes Lab?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.630
Yes, they're a huge company,
famous for their webtoons.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.230
I don't know much about web novels,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.570
but I know the CEO of Yes Lab.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.770
They're working on a new platform,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.669
and they need writers for the app.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.310
They're looking for new talent.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.939
- Really?
- Yes.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.480
Send me your story, and I'll see
if I can get it to the CEO.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.650
To the CEO?

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.450
For real?

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.280
This is wild.
I'm so glad I made that connection.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.719
- How did this fall in your lap?
- What do I do? Wait, which one...

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.889
- This one.
- This one?

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.390
- I think this one's best.
- What about this one?

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.790
No. This one.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.490
Thanks for dinner.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.030
Thank you for dinner.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.230
I'll be in touch, everyone.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.330
I have some friends drinking nearby,
so I'll take off first.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.240
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.700
- Bye.
- See you later.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:27.770
See you later.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.980
- Then...
- San, where are you going?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.610
I can give you a ride.
I have to call a driver anyway.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.450
It's right nearby,
so I can just walk.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.690
- Oh, well...
- Min Hak, which way are you headed?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.360
I'm...

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.230
going that way...

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.460
My manager said
he was picking me up at the school.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.160
Then walk with me.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.670
It's faster this way.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.700
- But...
- Yes?

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.440
I think I drank a little too much.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.670
So I want to walk around a bit.
You know, walk it off.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.210
Then I know the perfect place
for a walk.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.910
This way. There's a park that won
a top landscape architecture prize.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.980
It's huge.
It takes an hour to walk it all.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.450
Really?

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.490
- Let's go!
- No, hold on.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.090
Goodbye!
And thank you so much again.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.160
See you at school.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.430
Yes, okay.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.600
- Let's go.
- Get home safe.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.670
- Na Rae.
- Yes, let's go.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.070
How'd you know about that award?

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.470
What? How could you not?

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.470
Now, where did I park?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.480
No, it's fine.
I can just walk. It's really close.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.610
Oh, then, let's walk for a bit.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.580
It's been a while. We can catch up.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.490
Min Hak, you're a really nice guy,
but you can't read a room, can you?

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.560
What?

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.060
I tried to leave Yeon San
and Chang Yi alone together,

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.630
and I kept sending you signals
to make yourself scarce.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.170
Na Rae, I don't think
you're one to talk.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.700
What's that supposed to mean?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.040
Never mind.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.180
So, which way was that park again?

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.350
- That way.
- That way.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.410
Let's get going.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.850
So how'd you end up
at this university?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.690
Pardon?

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.650
A full four-year scholarship?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.960
Yes.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.959
Actually, this school's foundation
is on my mom's side.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.130
That's why I gave the lecture, too.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.030
My point is...

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.500
I know what Hangang University
is all about.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.240
I'm not trying to put it down
or anything.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.940
It's not the kind of school
you belong in.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.740
It's not like it's very competitive
or has a great reputation,

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.350
and the location is kind of awkward.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.350
I heard you quit Science High
your sophomore year without a word.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.390
So I just figured
you had some other plan.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.690
I'm sure you had your reasons,
though.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.590
This is me.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.700
What?

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.770
It's nearby.
I have to make a quick stop.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.400
- It's late. I'll walk you home...
- I have to go.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.310
San.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.440
I've looked you up
from time to time.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.850
I was curious how you were doing
and what you were up to.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.380
We had some really good times,
you know?

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.050
Did we?

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.460
Did I do something to upset you?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.460
No, nothing like that.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.590
I should get going.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.190
By making a compound
from the remaining element symbols?

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.760
Let's kill it! Are we ready?

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.200
Five, four, three, two, one!

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.170
Team Acetylene and Team Ozone,
you both are the winners!

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.680
- Can I get your phone?
- Sorry?

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.350
This is my phone number.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.860
Text me when the camp's over.
Let's grab a bite to eat.

Hey.

Na Rae roped me into
an hour-long walk,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.650
and thankfully,
it suddenly started to rain.

I don't think I have anything
you can change into,

- At least dry your hair.
- Thanks.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:11.420
Remember when
I didn't know what Python was...

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.180
and called it "Red Sun?"

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.450
And to be honest,
I still don't really get it.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.960
What was Python again?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.890
Was it you who explained it to me?

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.400
I'm not sure.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.570
I feel like I should know
for when we talk.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.440
I doubt we'll ever need to
chit-chat about it.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440
Still...

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.570
Tell me the simple version.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.949
Well,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.880
it's more concise and dynamic
than other languages,

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.820
and it's a programming language
that's easy to read.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.020
Is it easy to learn?

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.320
Concise doesn't necessarily
mean easy.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.190
It's compatible with a lot
of different operating systems.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.590
Even if they're different?

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560
Like us?

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.230
- That's not the right analogy.
- An extensive library...

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.069
Which is why it's highly scalable...

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.230
And intuitive...

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.180
What?

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.650
What, hold on.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.120
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard
with everything lately?

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.720
You feel a little warm.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.960
I'm a little tired,
but my temperature's normal.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.430
- Then why's your face so red?
- It's just my mood.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.930
"My mood?"

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.440
Maybe I'm wrong. Hold on.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.780
So?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.700
Who is it?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.940
Can I help you?

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.240
There's a water leak
in the apartment below us.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.740
May I take a look at the bathroom?

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.940
Do you really need to check
right now?

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.649
Your downstairs neighbour
keeps calling me nonstop,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.980
and frankly, I'm at my wits' end.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.480
Please, just let us check.
It won't take long anyway.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.250
You're older than me, right?

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.520
Just a second.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.730
Hey, do I know you from somewhere?

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.600
You look so familiar.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.030
I don't think so.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.610
Her name's hilarious, isn't it?
Ahn In Dae.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.610
- He's mine!
- Kang Min Hak is mine!

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.179
Hangang University, right?

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.190
You're the girl
whose laptop Min Hak broke?

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.490
No way!

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.090
You live here?

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.160
Hold on.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.840
What's wrong?

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.240
What's the matter?

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.840
There's a water leak downstairs,
and you can't be here right now.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.240
- There's someone at the door.
- At this hour?

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.379
Yes.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.810
But if it's just the repairman...

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.850
shouldn't a strong guy like me
stick around to protect you?

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.720
Go and have a look!

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.850
Gosh.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.430

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.430
Just a minute!

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.610
- Hey, get under the sofa.
- Under the sofa...

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.510
- Hey, there's stuff under here.
- Right. Then, here.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:37.950
San.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.220
What if I just put on a hat
and a mask?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.990
- No, that won't work.
- Why not? I just need to cover up.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.690
No, with her, things are very likely
to go wrong.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.360
The fridge? No, it's too cold.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.160
- The balcony!
- The balcony.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.940
Come on in.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.240
I'll just check the bathroom.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.150
If you go to Hangang University,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.190
- what's your major?
- I'm CompSci.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.490
- Then you must see Min Hak often!
- What?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.230
Isn't he a model?

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.459
Right, exactly!

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.630
The Modelling
and CompSci departments...

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.169
were merged
into the Converged Physical...

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.900

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.070
My gosh, she's a real fan.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.740
Do you see him often?

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.970
No, not that often.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.380
That makes sense.
He's always so busy.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.720
Do you have any classes
with Min Hak?

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.550
Yes, sometimes.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.690
But since that friend
is in the Department of Modelling...

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.759
"Friend?" You're friends with him?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.020
No! We're not close.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.890
Too bad. I was just asking because
on Min Hak's Instagram,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.000
I saw he does group projects
with people from school.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.599
Really?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.270
Maybe I should go to
Hangang University since it's close.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.070
I'm so jealous of those people.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.370
But then again,

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.140
I worry there are too many girls
around Min Hak.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.980
It's bad for his image.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.510
Wait, are you the building manager
or something?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.880
Please.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.720
I'm the landlord's daughter.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.990
- Did you tinker with the toilet?
- Yes.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.960
My dad tinkered with it a little.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.930
I see. I think that's the problem.
Let me check the balcony, too.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.259
The balcony?

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.560
The balcony...

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.700
I'm not really sure if now is
a good time to check the balcony.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.040
- I'll help clear it if it's a mess.
- No.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.410
Just stay here for a second.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.710
Sir, in the corner of the bathroom,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.110
there's something you should see.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.880
The daughter will take a look, too.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.490
He's not my dad, though.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.519
Doesn't that look really weird?

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.560
What part?

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.560
I think she means over there.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.060
Go and hide!

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.500
- Get out quickly.
- Where?

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.900
Right over there.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.640
Let me see.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.340
Okay, so the valve is supposed to be
on this side.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.050
I don't see anything
particularly wrong.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.020
I wonder what she thinks is strange.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.820
There's been a leak in the corner
ever since I moved in.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.860
And I think we need to be clear
about who's responsible.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.730
This isn't a leak.
It's just standing water.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.100
I see. I guess I was mistaken.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.970
Right?
So there's no real issue, sir?

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.370
Should we check the balcony?

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.610
This way.

Yeon San.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.110
Let's make sure we end up
at the same school.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.720
- Their past?
- No, Science High.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.080
They are Science High prodigies.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.950
This is the first time I've heard
San talk about that time.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.790
I'll be back with some breakfast.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.520
No way.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.500
I heard there's this place
with a really good vibe.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.200
I'll work around your schedule.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600
What?

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.640
Hey, Na Rae.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.010
I'm free tomorrow.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.750
No, that was my friend.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.350
- Go on.
- I said I was free.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.050
Hey, I'll call you back in a bit.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.260
You're free?

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.720
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.630
Then go to that yakitori place
with me.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.760
Why all of a sudden?

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.830
You wrote this, didn't you?

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640
Yes.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.110
Wait, you didn't actually think
I just up and left you, did you?

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.920
Na Rae is sleeping so soundly.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.100
(I'll be back with some breakfast.)

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.250
Whatever. I'll chalk it up
to bad luck and just forget it.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.810
It's not like he's so great.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.250
I want to cry too.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.450
I can't believe my first time
ended like this.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.490
That jerk is the absolute worst.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.890
The absolute worst.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.830
How could you find a yakitori place
and invite someone else?

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.670
You didn't even get a meal with me
after we slept together.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.640
I thought you didn't want
to get a meal with me.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.640
I was racking my brain,
wondering what I did wrong.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.650
- At 7pm.
- What?

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.450
So, let's go to
the yakitori tomorrow at 7pm.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.550
Okay.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.390
I'll come get you, despite you being
right across from me.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.890
They're at it again.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.800
Way to go! Bye, pal!

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.939
I saw on Instagram
that Min Hak's older brother...

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.240
liked omakase.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.040
So, what about Min Hak?
What does he like?

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.880
Excuse me, I need to get this.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.250
Hey, Dad.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.660
For that, if you open
the back of the kiosk...

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.830
Yes, just press that button again.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.630
I did that already.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.400
Oh, there's another button here.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.100
All right, let me see.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.070
Okay, got it.
I'll call if I get stuck again.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.650
Hey, it's okay.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.390
- What?
- Sorry. I'm so tactless.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.630
The people here aren't conservative,
you know.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.930
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.869
You've got two phones,
men's shoes by the door,

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.030
and men's clothes lying around...

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.840
Those are my clothes.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.840
Come on. I'm almost 20.
I know what's up.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.940
No, really, it's just me here.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.650
Excuse me. Could you go downstairs
and check how it is?

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.760
Min Hak, come on out.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.230
Okay, come on out.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.370
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.110
Are you okay?

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.910
Thanks for your hard work.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.150
Bye.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.580
Darn it.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.390
- My phone...
- Right.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.850
I'll call you.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.990
- What?
- Right.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.190
What is it?

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.360
- What?
- Just let me borrow this. Okay?

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500
All right.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.100
Goodness. Are you okay?

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.070
- I'll call you!
- Okay!

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.850
- Oh my. Hello.
- Oh gosh...

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.820
Are you all right?

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.290
Come out and see this!
Your boyfriend fell on the steps!

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.270
Did you really fall?

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.070
Oh, gosh...

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.940
I'm fine. That was a close one.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.279
I know. We have to be more careful.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.440
Tell me about it.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.150
Since I'll be coming over often,
right?

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.250
That's not what I meant.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.050
By the way, I saw something
while I was in the closet.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.660
What?

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.260
The magazine you were
the cover model for.

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:52.960
I studied with this one too,
you know.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.530
- Let me have this.
- I should've burned them.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.770
Why? That'd be a waste.
Let me have it.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.100
Why would I give this to you?
I can't exactly burn you instead.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.110
All right! Goodness.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.110
- Cute, right?
- Why you...

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.110
Give it to me.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.280
What's with you?

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.800
(Hangang University)

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.150
Hey, I actually landed a meeting
with the rep from Yes Lab.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.650
- Through Chang Yi?
- Yes. Amazing, right?

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.760
- Did you look them up online?
- What?

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.160
To see if the company is legit
and if he actually works there.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.630
What's that supposed to mean?
You doubt my writing is good enough?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.370
No, that's not it.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.699
You were almost scammed by that AI.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.900
That's why she's worried, right?

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.509
- Still, it's better to be sure.
- Chang Yi introduced me.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.610
What's there to worry about?

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.550
What do they even know
about Park Chang Yi?

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.680
Hey, did Chang Yi ever get in touch
with you about Split Alarm?

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.020
What? About what?

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.690
We talked about turning Split Alarm
into a business.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.760
Yes.
I thought it was a good idea, too.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.390
And we're not guaranteed to win
first place in the competition.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.370
I did hear from him.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.770
But before we prepare
for the competition,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.240
if a rumour gets out that we sold
our project with an insider's help,

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.380
it would be bad for either of us,
so he said to talk later.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.480
Let's just handle it ourselves.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.980
Really?

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.250
That's a shame.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.250
Hey, forget it.
All we have to do is win.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.560
What are you up to
after class today?

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.540
(Min Hak: What are you up to
after class today?)

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.770
I need data for Split Alarm,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.610
- so I'm meeting a senior I know...
- Joo Yeon San.
