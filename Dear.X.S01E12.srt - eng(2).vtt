DEAR X

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.764
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.390
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.066
Don't think it's a bit much?

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.988
How many guys did you bring
just to take me out?

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.907
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.038
So, that's all you have to say
for your last words?

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.294
First, I'm going to prep two cameras.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.548
You can install them
at the location I mentioned.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:31.633
Okay. And then?

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.135
Then, my phone.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.055
We install spyware on it
as insurance.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.515
You know, a zombie phone.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:44.479
Then I put an app on your spare phone
so you can remotely control my phone.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.108
Even if my phone is turned off

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:51.236
we can tweak it so that certain
functions stay active like malware.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.196
Audio and video recording
will still work.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.950
Everything will auto-upload
to the cloud every 30 minutes

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.076
so it won't be tampered with.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.245
This feels dangerous.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.623
What are you planning that you need
to prepare this thoroughly?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.583
Knowing too much will get you hurt.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:09.295
This guy.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.475
You think this is funny?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.897
It is funny. You don't think so?

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.108
Hey.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.068
Let's be real.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.445
Can you actually kill me?

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.698
Do you have the guts
without your boss

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.409
Moon Do-hyuk, giving the order?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.704
You're just his errand boy.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.748
You must be desperate
to find a way out of this.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.169
Forget it.
Mr. Moon already signed off on it.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.629
Whether you die here

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:54.090
or vanish without a trace

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.718
it won't be a problem,
you piece of shit.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.387
Take him out.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:15.987
You scared me.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.698
Because she's more likely to live
a normal life

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.491
through you, rather than me.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.619
Tell me. What do you want me to do?

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.455
- Anything for you.
- If anything happens, call me.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.877
Why not? Why won't you?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.045
You could be in danger--

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.130
No. I don't want that.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.424
Why do I have to suffer?

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:37.550
All right.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:40.220
- I understand.
- So go ahead, Ah-jin.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:42.764
Use me all you want.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.475
That's what I want.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.480
MESSAGES

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:36.776
KIM JAE-OH

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:38.611
CONFIRM

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.283
How many guys did you bring?

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.161
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:59.590
Check his phone.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.722
YOON JUN-SEO

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.182
Have you finished the job?

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.892
As you can see, yes.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.065
Make sure to clean it up
without a trace.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.567
Do we get rid of this, too?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.901
It's his phone.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.486
You can give it to me.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.947
I need to check it, just in case.

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:27.201
This psycho dragged the CEO's name
into his threats.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.037
I need to see what he was holding.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.774
Welcome home, ma'am.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.303
CALLING

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.308
The phone you have dialed
is turned off.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.937
You will be connected to voicemail
after the beep.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.689
You will incur charges
once connected.

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:42.777
Press one to leave a message.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.781
Press two to leave a callback number.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.996
Your time to press a button
has expired.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.916
Press one to leave a message.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:01.003
Press two to leave a callback number.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.429
Your time to press a button
has expired.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.473
Press one to leave a message.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:16.519
Press two to leave a callback number.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.573
Please check the instructions
and call again.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.700
Thank you for using our service.

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.034
Goodbye.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.665
Take care of Kim Jae-oh
however you want.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.960
Just make sure
I never hear about him again.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.211
I don't want his name

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.632
ruining another meal with my wife.

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:36.557
EPISODE 12: THE FINAL X

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.820
Where's Kim Jae-oh?

00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:55.159
Where is he?

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.495
I had no idea

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.498
what this job was for.

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.419
If I had known,
I never would have helped him.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.338
What was it?

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:09.465
The cameras.

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.677
He asked me to install them
at the construction site.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.680
He said the footage would auto-upload

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.683
and that I should collect the cameras
once enough time passed

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:20.726
and hand you

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.312
the memory card

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:26.816
and my spare phone.

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:37.410
What are you doing? Throw him.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.876
Two of you stay on the lookout.
The rest go down and clean it up.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.253
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.099
I don't see anyone.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.268
Even Ms. Gong stepped out.

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.271
I asked them to give us some privacy.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.775
Sit. I have something to say.

00:10:54.862 --> 00:10:55.863
I wonder

00:10:56.697 --> 00:10:58.240
what you want to say to me.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.874
From now on,
don't touch me without permission.

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:09.293
Don't hug me from behind
like earlier.

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:12.129
Don't even let your breath touch me.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.257
Don't do anything.

00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:18.928
That's unreasonable.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.847
Aren't we husband and wife?

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.432
Because we're husband and wife

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.977
I'm telling you
not to treat me like a doll.

00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:31.982
If I'm your wife

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.694
you should treat me as your equal.

00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:37.446
Isn't that right?

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:46.163
I thought pitying you
and adoring you was enough.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.875
Why should I listen to that?

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.336
I'm sure you received
the report by now.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:58.968
I found a way to corner you.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.970
People who got locked up

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:04.932
and disappeared on your orders.

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:08.060
Now, there's one more.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.025
And I have the evidence.

00:12:19.363 --> 00:12:20.656
Let's be real.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.408
Can you actually kill me?

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:24.410
Do you have the guts
without your boss

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.371
Moon Do-hyuk, giving the order?

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.166
You're just his errand boy.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.752
You must be desperate
to find a way out of this.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:36.297
Forget it.
Mr. Moon already signed off on it.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.507
Whether you die here

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.051
or vanish without a trace

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:44.138
it won't be a problem,
you piece of shit.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.723
What are you doing?

00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:46.807
Throw him.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.939
You're not the only one

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.026
who can corner me or discard me.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.237
With your perfect little life

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.199
a single crack will stand out.

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:06.118
Can you handle that?

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:08.913
Mr. Perfectionist?

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:17.671
So, this is what you wanted to say?

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.591
You made me sit here just for that?

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.849
When you gave the order

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.144
I was there.

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.149
The evidence is here.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.776
And so is the witness.

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.989
I can't tell
if this is a negotiation or a threat.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.034
Does your dear friend know

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:48.869
that his death

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:52.373
is being used like this?

00:13:52.456 --> 00:13:54.708
He'd be proud

00:13:56.293 --> 00:13:57.837
he was used for my sake.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:02.091
It wasn't exploitation.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.635
He let himself be used.

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:10.850
Just so I could have something
to shake you with

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:12.560
he risked everything.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:15.771
You had everything from the beginning

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.148
so I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:58.397
What the heck did you do?

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.693
Say something.

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:04.528
If I tell you

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.364
can you handle it?

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.325
Tell me.

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:12.786
I wanted to put a leash
around Do-hyuk's neck.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.456
So he couldn't mess with me again.

00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:18.125
And Jae-oh helped me do that.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:22.838
He walked straight in

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.423
knowing that he'd die.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.219
That's what he wanted.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:30.638
What are you trying to say?

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.057
You did nothing wrong,
whether Jae-oh is dead or not?

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.516
- That--
- What should I have done, then?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.936
How long are you
going to live like that?

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.771
I'm sick of it, too.

00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:39.855
Jun-seo.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.358
Now that Jae-oh ended up like that

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:44.777
I can't stop anymore.

00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:47.488
Is this all my fault?

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.367
Who has the right to condemn me?

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.244
Who can understand

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.456
my situation and my position
right now?

00:15:58.123 --> 00:15:59.792
Then, answer me this one thing.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.087
You can stop now.

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:08.175
This is the end, right?

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.474
Right?

00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:17.726
Please say something.

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.480
Please tell me that this is the end!

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.650
I can't stop.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.319
I won't stop.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:32.449
If you knew how dangerously
I'm hanging on to this position

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.370
you wouldn't tell me to stop.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.644
This is Yoon Jun-seo.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.273
Does the documentary offer
from last time

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.109
still stand?

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.366
Hold on, sir. How can I help you?

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.201
- What's the matter?
- Moon Do-hyuk.

00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.373
Mr. Yoon Jun-seo?

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.919
I didn't think
you'd come find me in person.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.838
You killed Jae-oh.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:32.134
Everything you ordered is
all recorded here.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.262
I see.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.016
And?

00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:41.435
If you're planning
to do anything to Ah-jin

00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:44.855
I'll spread this footage
to the media.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.198
A lot of people are telling me
what to do today.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.783
But tell me.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:59.620
Do you think I'll just sit still
while you post that?

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.332
I'm sure you know I can do
far more than you can.

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.460
A cheap video
where my name is barely mentioned

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:08.087
won't...

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.588
- Do we get rid of this, too?
- What's this?

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:10.672
It's his phone.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:11.882
You can give it to me.

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:15.761
This psycho dragged the CEO's name
into his threats.

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:18.013
Anyway, once this is handled properly

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.015
put in a good word for me
with Mr. Moon.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.976
I still feel uneasy
about that mistake last time.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.561
The fire incident, right?

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:27.648
If we had killed him properly then,
we wouldn't have had to do this.

00:18:28.398 --> 00:18:30.818
Perhaps releasing the video
and audio recordings I have

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.528
won't deal a fatal blow to you.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.446
But you know what?

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:37.366
It'll leave a stain.

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:39.034
Once those stains pile up

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.620
the perfect reputation
you've been keeping so far

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.832
will get dirty eventually.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:48.377
I can always clean up
when things get dirty.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:52.297
But are you threatening me right now?

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.174
I'm here to warn you.

00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:58.011
Because I can't just sit by and watch
you or Ah-jin any longer.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:18:59.847
Now that I think about it

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.600
your friend also tried to warn me,
and we both know how he ended up.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.064
I guess friends

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.316
share similar traits.

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.198
Leave Ah-jin alone.

00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.661
I'll be the one to stop her.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:26.832
You just take a step back
and watch from afar.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.585
Just like you always have.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.397
I've come to make a confession.

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.361
Sister, I know
who killed your family.

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.030
It's someone you know.

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:03.535
Actress Baek Ah-jin

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:06.663
invited to the Berlin Film Festival
with The Woman with a Suitcase

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:10.876
is making a strong impression
internationally.

00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:14.213
Through her recent film
Amen to Nothing

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:17.132
Baek Ah-jin has captivated
critics and audiences

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.885
with a bold transformation
and a fully immersive performance.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:23.889
Many say that she's at the peak
of her acting career.

00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:25.682
Tonight at the Bluedragon Awards

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:29.269
she's considered the strongest
candidate for Best Actress.

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.813
Will she take home the award

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:36.068
at the Bluedragon Awards tonight?
All eyes are on her.

00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:41.573
- Why are you glowing so much today?
- You look stunning.

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.868
It's the same face you see every day.
What's the fuss?

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:48.121
And it's pretty every day.
I can never get tired of your beauty.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:49.206
I agree.

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.877
JUN-SEO

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:00.509
JUN-SEO

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:42.152
You can just leave that.
I can throw it out for you.

00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:43.236
- I'll--
- No.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.113
It's okay. I'll throw it out.

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.365
Oh, sure.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.728
BAEK AH-JIN

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:19.856
If you ever feel like helping me,
call me then.

00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:23.568
Otherwise, don't get in my way
for no reason.

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:58.186
It's Baek Ah-jin!

00:25:06.963 --> 00:25:10.425
You're aware the award show is airing
on a different channel now, right?

00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:15.222
They say the Best Actress Award is
basically guaranteed to go to her.

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.265
That actually works out better.

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:21.144
Because her final appearance

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:25.482
will stay in people's memories
as her most beautiful one.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.738
DIM HEART: TWO FACES OF AN ACTRESS

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:35.242
NOTABLE TRAITS:
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:37.619
FOUND IN ABOUT 4 PERCENT
OF THE POPULATION

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:42.916
Baek Ah-jin.

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:48.755
She falls within the four percent
of the population

00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:50.423
with antisocial personality disorder.

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.886
She views others as tools

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.556
and manipulates or uses them
to achieve her goals.

00:25:57.847 --> 00:26:01.393
At the biggest annual event
in Korean cinema

00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:07.774
Baek Ah-jin stands
as a top contender for Best Actress

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:11.278
drawing intense attention
from media and fans alike.

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.745
She has never
physically committed murder

00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:22.664
but she caused
the deaths of two people.

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:29.170
She has deliberately approached
only men who were of use to her.

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:35.468
She still harbors
an unfulfilled plan to kill.

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:44.728
She is Baek Ah-jin, an actress.

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.685
Now, let us begin

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:27.854
the 46th Bluedragon Awards.

00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:29.689
Let's get started.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:39.741
Baek Ah-jin is

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.743
the strongest candidate
for Best Actress, right?

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.912
If she wins, ratings will explode.

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:45.705
Don't tell her anything beforehand.

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:48.041
Make sure no one gets near her.
Got it?

00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:49.626
...Song Kyeong-su.

00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:51.795
DIM HEART

00:27:52.295 --> 00:27:53.296
Baek Ah-jin.

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:57.884
The elegant and kind actress.

00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:00.261
Baek Ah-jin?

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.597
She was the epitome of perfection.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:04.307
She was smart, kind, and pretty.

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.851
She stood out wherever she was.

00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:10.563
Everyone at our school knew her.

00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:13.775
Even the teachers adored her.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:18.905
But those who knew her well
tell a completely different story.

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:21.032
We met those people.

00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:25.412
What do I think of Baek Ah-jin?

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:29.082
A devil wearing human skin.

00:28:29.332 --> 00:28:30.417
She didn't have a mother.

00:28:31.418 --> 00:28:32.919
And her father was a criminal.

00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:35.630
She wasn't normal,
at least from what I felt.

00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:39.342
It always seemed like her emotions
were rehearsed, as if she was acting.

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:42.053
Her acting has
always been exceptional.

00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:44.723
She switched masks
whenever it suited her needs.

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:47.267
That's why I could never tell
what she was thinking.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.062
I think she has
very little empathy for others.

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:53.356
I figured that was the case.

00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:56.985
I even recommended
she get psychological counseling.

00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:58.278
TRUE LOVE COUNSELING CENTER

00:28:58.361 --> 00:29:00.071
Check this out.
It's about Baek Ah-jin.

00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:02.240
Is this for real?

00:29:02.323 --> 00:29:03.825
Isn't she terrifying?

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.535
How can a human being do this?

00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:09.247
Now, we'll move on to the highly
anticipated Best Actress Award.

00:29:09.622 --> 00:29:14.377
Last year's winner, Jin Seo-gyeong,
will be joining us to present it.

00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:16.004
Please give her a round of applause.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.674
Hello, I'm Jin Seo-gyeong.

00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:22.302
Let me announce the winner.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:24.721
The Best Actress Award

00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:27.724
at the 46th Bluedragon Awards...

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:30.769
goes to...

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.735
Baek Ah-jin for Amen to Nothing.

00:29:38.818 --> 00:29:40.111
Congratulations.

00:29:49.662 --> 00:29:51.623
Baek Ah-jin,
the winner of the Best Actress Award

00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:53.291
portrayed a nun in Amen to Nothing

00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:56.002
who investigates the tragedy
that befell her family

00:29:56.085 --> 00:29:58.379
and carries out revenge

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.089
delivering a deeply moving

00:30:00.173 --> 00:30:02.300
and introspective performance
about a character

00:30:02.383 --> 00:30:04.177
in anguish over religious doubts.

00:30:04.677 --> 00:30:06.387
Congratulations
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.322
Thank you.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.409
First of all

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:30.495
my mom

00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:33.122
in heaven.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:35.917
How do I look, Mom?

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:40.380
Are you proud of me?

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.423
Her mother died in an accident.

00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:46.553
Her father was
the victim of a murder case.

00:30:46.636 --> 00:30:49.889
She was also present
at her lover's grandmother's death

00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:52.392
and later, her lover took
his own life.

00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:55.436
For one person
to experience all of this

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.981
the coincidences seem too extreme.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.899
- A documentary about Ah-jin is out.
- What?

00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:01.109
That's a scoop.

00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:02.819
Start preparing for revisions.

00:31:02.902 --> 00:31:05.446
- Check if any articles are out.
- Yes, sir.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.618
While working on Amen to Nothing

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.872
I couldn't help but wonder...

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.042
"Where is my God?"

00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:21.504
Looking back

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:24.257
I realized

00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:27.135
He was inside me all along.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.263
I grew up

00:31:31.347 --> 00:31:33.141
in an unfortunate environment.

00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:39.188
But luck always followed me.

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:40.857
I thought we were incredibly lucky.

00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:43.109
I caught myself wondering
if she was an angel

00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:44.819
who had come down for my brother.

00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:48.156
But I overheard something
at my grandma's funeral.

00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:50.033
Was it someone in the film industry?

00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:52.076
Apparently, she was smiling
in front of him.

00:31:55.747 --> 00:32:01.002
Every step I took to get here

00:32:01.794 --> 00:32:03.379
wasn't easy.

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:06.424
But I never stopped.

00:32:06.966 --> 00:32:08.509
I kept moving forward

00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:11.888
and eventually, I got here.

00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:16.684
Her acting has
always been exceptional.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.479
She switched masks
whenever it suited her needs.

00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:23.149
To everyone who walked with me

00:32:23.983 --> 00:32:26.361
on my journey to today

00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:30.949
I offer my sincere gratitude.

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.409
She used the people around her

00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.912
to make me look
like an idiot and a thief.

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:40.458
Could she have used our boss
to try to kill her own father?

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:43.127
We were like family
when she was dating my brother.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.713
I thought she'd at least
show up once at the funeral.

00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:49.258
I was stunned.

00:32:49.884 --> 00:32:52.845
Soon after, news came out
that she was marrying a chaebol.

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.518
I was like, "What?"

00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:06.317
These testimonies about Baek Ah-jin

00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.611
are not easy to verify.

00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:12.740
So, we wondered
whether continuing this investigation

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.367
was the right thing to do.

00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:16.869
Then, we learned something new.

00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:18.955
Rumors surrounding

00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:23.209
the suspicious death of her father,
Baek Seon-gyu.

00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:28.715
Dim Heart began to track down
the truth of that day.

00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:34.679
There were three primary suspects
in this case.

00:33:36.222 --> 00:33:38.307
Former baseball player, Mr. Choi.

00:33:40.643 --> 00:33:42.770
And the person who was
consistently abused by the victim

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:45.815
and thus had the clearest motive,
the victim's daughter

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.233
actress Baek Ah-jin

00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:49.152
BAEK AH-JIN
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:50.403
I remember that case.

00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:52.530
It was very unusual.

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:56.492
There was only one victim
but multiple potential perpetrators.

00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:59.454
Among them, the one
with the clearest motive was

00:33:59.954 --> 00:34:01.497
the victim's daughter, Baek Ah-jin.

00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:09.505
Lastly

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.550
to everyone

00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:14.969
who loved my performance

00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:18.306
and showed enthusiasm for my work

00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:21.059
and to those who supported me
not only as an actress

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:23.102
but as a person.

00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:25.438
I give this glory to you.

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.694
I sincerely thank you.

00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:25.456
The final suspect provided
our team with a decisive tip.

00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:28.626
It was Yoon Seok-ha,
the author of Co-Offender Y.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.383
The incident back then

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.177
was planned from the beginning.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.848
It's true that Ah-jin
deliberately sought out

00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:43.683
someone kind enough to act for her.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:47.270
It's also true that
she found Choi Jung-ho and used him.

00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:51.357
It would have been easy for her
to win someone over

00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:53.234
and set a trap.

00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:55.486
Back then

00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:58.364
she even had a stalker decoy to use.

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:03.369
When the said stalker hit her,
she immediately called Mr. Choi

00:36:03.452 --> 00:36:05.538
so he rushed over.

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.832
But it wasn't a stalker.

00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:15.756
The person Choi struck
with the bat was...

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.050
Seeing you alive
wasn't part of my plan.

00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:20.553
...the man disguised
to look like her stalker.

00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:23.472
It was her father

00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:25.433
Baek Seon-gyu.

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:42.825
When I arrived, Choi was already gone

00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:45.161
and Baek Seon-gyu
was lying on the floor.

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:46.829
There was blood everywhere

00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:48.956
so I assumed he was dead.

00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:53.711
Then, I saw Ah-jin.

00:36:58.758 --> 00:37:00.760
She was sitting
against the bathroom wall

00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:03.512
holding the bat.

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.026
She looked at me and said

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:19.654
"It's over."

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.160
That's what she said.

00:37:27.536 --> 00:37:28.704
"It's all over."

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.193
Other people's suffering
meant nothing to her.

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:03.364
She only ever used people
to achieve her own goals

00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:05.700
and discarded them.

00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:10.371
That's how she built...

00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:15.209
her current position.

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:40.252
Do you want to go somewhere?

00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:44.256
Anywhere

00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:46.258
without people.

00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:15.579
I thought you'd change
if I waited long enough.

00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:18.707
But you didn't.

00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:22.211
I realized that far too late.

00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:24.880
That I couldn't save you

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:28.342
and that I was clinging
to something impossible.

00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:32.763
That you could never change.

00:40:33.973 --> 00:40:34.974
Exactly.

00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:38.894
And you realized
that simple thing too late.

00:40:40.062 --> 00:40:42.064
So what? Do you regret it now?

00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:48.320
No.

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:54.243
Because now,
I'm the only one who can handle you.

00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:00.624
Handle me how?

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.336
I have nowhere to go anymore.

00:41:06.172 --> 00:41:07.631
If you truly have nowhere to go

00:41:08.424 --> 00:41:10.426
how about we go to hell together

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:11.802
Ah-jin?

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.642
Are you being serious?

00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:25.274
I already decided
to stay with you to the end.

00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:28.652
If you stop now

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.279
I'll stop, too.

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:33.657
What will you do?

00:41:49.965 --> 00:41:53.260
I thought there was nothing left
that could tie me down.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.311
But it was you.

00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:06.440
My final shackle.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.507
Let's not do anything anymore.

00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:40.307
So that no one gets hurt

00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:43.769
we'll only look at each other.

00:42:52.778 --> 00:42:53.779
I love you...

00:42:57.116 --> 00:42:58.284
Ah-jin.

00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:42.745
Last night, the car driven
by author Yoon Seok-ha

00:43:42.828 --> 00:43:45.998
crashed into a guardrail
and fell off a cliff.

00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:50.044
The driver, Yoon Seok-ha,
died at the scene

00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:52.546
and actress Baek Ah-jin,
believed to be the passenger

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.756
is currently missing.

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:57.134
The police are investigating
the exact cause of the accident.

00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:59.053
WRITER YOON SEOK-HA DEAD,
ACTRESS BAEK AH-JIN MISSING

00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:05.768
At some point

00:44:06.935 --> 00:44:12.232
your presence started feeling
like a blade stuck in my heart.

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:19.156
Even in death, I wouldn't be able
to understand or forgive you.

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:25.704
So, in this life, I wanted to cleanly
sever anything tied to you and leave.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:30.626
And I wanted to disappear

00:44:31.543 --> 00:44:32.795
from your life, too.

00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:35.714
That's the best choice.

00:44:38.967 --> 00:44:42.221
I gave you
one last brief moment of happiness

00:44:43.722 --> 00:44:44.723
so you can live

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:47.643
the rest of your life
with that in mind.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.690
Maybe this is
the first and last long revenge

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:56.902
I'll ever give you, Mom.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.072
No, Jun-seo.

00:45:02.324 --> 00:45:03.450
Jun-seo.

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:06.787
I hope you stay healthy.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.122
Jun-seo!

00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:14.169
Jun-seo!

00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.588
You can't find her anywhere?

00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:03.218
No signs of life or trace anywhere?

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:06.513
Fine, never mind.

00:46:06.889 --> 00:46:08.098
You don't have to go that far.

00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:09.433
ACTRESS BAEK AH-JIN STILL MISSING

00:46:09.516 --> 00:46:11.018
Just leave the broadcast

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:13.395
and respond
when they ask for cooperation.

00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:18.942
We want to share
a follow-up to our previous broadcast

00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:21.361
"Two Faces of an Actress."

00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:23.947
We recently learned that Yoon Jun-seo

00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:25.866
our informant
and the author of Co-Offender Y

00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:28.827
passed away not long ago.

00:46:29.995 --> 00:46:32.623
Please pay attention to this video.

00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:36.794
It was submitted anonymously.

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:39.755
This footage proves

00:46:39.838 --> 00:46:42.841
that she was in the vehicle

00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:44.426
that Yoon Jun-seo was driving.

00:46:56.563 --> 00:46:59.107
After this video,
she vanished completely

00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:01.902
and has not been reachable since.

00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:34.643
THE LATE BAEK AH-JIN

00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.772
Do something about this!

00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:53.767
