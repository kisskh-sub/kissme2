The receiver cannot...

18
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,810
Is something going on outside?

Oh, this?

It's in case people try to bite me.

I can't reach my mom.

I'm sure you can reach her later.

Even if someone knocks,
don't ever open the door.

28
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,501
I'll be right back. Watch TV, okay?

29
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,040
The TV's not working either.

30
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,141

00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,100
We need to barricade this.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,641
You saw them too.

36
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,870
Sit down and rest.

37
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:58,341
Okay.

38
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,080
Jung Guk. Keep an eye on him.

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,491
Okay.

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,621

00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,540
The infected are outside.

It's too quiet.

Hey, you. Face the wall.

- What?

54
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,621
Symptoms of the mad person disease.

55
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,061
Do they include a racing heartbeat,

56
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,330
and an itchy wound
where you were scratched...

57
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,501
that feels warm?

58
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:26,401
That's just old age.

59
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,100
Aren't these people doing their jobs?

60
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,070
What building is the management office in?

61
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,980
Which was it?

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,311
It's next to the children's library.

63
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,751
Whatever. I'll find it.

64
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,751
Dong Hyun, wait.

65
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:44,950
It's just old age.

66
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,300
It's true. Don't you believe me?

67
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,170
Even less on this topic.

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,980
It's true.
Everyone from the other buildings is sick.

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
They roll their eyeballs...

70
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,250
and walk like this. I swear.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Darn it.

72
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:18,680
What are you doing?

73
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,290
My kids.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,021
Will they be okay?

75
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,661
They'll be safer than us here.

76
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:28,661
My gosh.

77
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,930
Hey, you, lady. Aren't you Unit 401?

78
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:32,930
Is your internet down too?

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,531
Don't talk to me like I'm married.

80
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,500
The Internet and phone are all down.

81
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:42,341
Residents from the other buildings are infected.
Have you heard?

82
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,381
For real?

83
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,940
That's crazy.

84
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,011
Who said that? The news?

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,821
He did. Ask him about it.

86
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:53,591
It's true.

87
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,750
It's true.

88
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,790
What?

89
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,401
What's all this?

90
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:07,631
Hey, people.

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,141
Excuse me. Don't crowd this place.

92
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,800
Go to the gym, okay?

93
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,110
That's where everyone else is.

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,511
Everyone else who?

95
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,581
The residents.

96
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,850
Do you see this?

97
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,120
Is this real blood?

98
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,581
Would it be ketchup?

99
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,250
I'm not the only witness.

100
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,750
I saw it too.

101
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,321
Mr. Lee from the management office was sick...

102
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,860
and his eyes were white.

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,161
He was like this.

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,860
I don't get it.

105
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,401
This morning, they caused a fuss
about locking us in our building.

106
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,670
How could they all be infected already?

107
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,141
Hello.

108
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,341
Is that real blood? Whose blood is it?

109
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,011
- No.
- Put that phone down.

110
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,180
Can we have a word?

111
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,810
What?

112
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,951
This is blood?

113
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,480
- What's outside?
- Stay away from there.

114
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,620
- Stay clear.
- This is real blood.

115
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,920
Are you doing this to scare me?

116
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,391
Isn't this a first?

117
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,721
What do you mean?

118
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,831
Aren't you trying to...

119
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,161
replace me as resident representative?

120
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,701
- The kids are pranking us.
- Look.

121
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:12,930
Ms. Oh.

122
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,901
How do you open this door?

123
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:17,641
Dong Hyun, do you know how to open it?

124
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,701
I'm not interested in representing anyone.

125
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,271
Don't mind me.

126
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,610
Get away from the door.

127
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,881
It's dangerous outside.

128
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,110
- Well...
- Don't go outside.

129
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,180
- Just for a moment.
- Step back.

130
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,511
- I think someone walked by.
- Don't you see this?

131
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,951
Do you know what's outside?

132
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,381
I'm curious.

133
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,250
- Calm down.
- The kids are fooling around.

134
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,560
- Let's have a look.
- The air is stuffy.

135
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,091
- Put down your phone!
- Come on.

136
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:40,531
- Calm down.
- Wait.

137
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,230
- Back away.
- Sir.

138
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,930
Where are you going?

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,571
They want to open the door.
You saw the monster too.

140
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:50,440
Then say something instead of running away.

141
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,971
- Don't push.
- Let's see.

142
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,511
I'm glad you're here.
Tell them what's outside.

143
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:56,581
My gosh.

144
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:59,841
Yes, good. The door is open.

145
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,451
Those who want to can go.

146
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:03,381
Well...

147
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,750
Not like this.

148
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,161
Go on.

149
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,661
Well...

150
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,230
Well... No.

151
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,841
The air is stuffy in the basement.

152
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:31,881
It wouldn't be right to smoke down here, would it?

153
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,980
How can you back down just like that?

154
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
Okay, then.

155
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,091
I'll trust you two for once.

156
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,050
Detective.

157
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,391
I don't have to worry, do I?

158
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,420
We must inform the other residents.

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,761
We must discuss rations...

160
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:23,631
and about the non-residents
who are stuck here.

161
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,401
We can't broadcast
without the management office,

162
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,871
and the Internet's down too,
so how will we alert them all?

163
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,300
We talk to them in person.

164
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,871
What about your gun?

165
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,210
I gave it to Jung Guk.

166
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:40,751
What did the man from downstairs say
when he put the cuffs on you?

167
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,710
Our Constitution protects our bodily integrity.

168
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,621
It's one of the major rights we have.

169
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,220
He can't do that without any due process.

170
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,720
Actually, I don't remember it clearly.

171
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,261
But he didn't say anything about that.

172
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,031
He didn't tell me about my rights
when he arrested me.

173
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,161
Then do the police have evidence?

174
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,330
Don't tell me...

175
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,731
you actually think that I killed my wife...

176
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,300
or something.

177
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:07,111
My opinion here doesn't matter.

178
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,970
That's the court's decision.

179
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,481
You know,

180
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:16,111
I really loved my wife, Min Ji.

181
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,220
I still have a hard time believing...

182
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,491
that she's gone.

183
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,820
Then our defence strategy will be
that you are innocent...

184
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,521
and this was an illegal arrest.

185
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:27,690
And...

186
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:30,861
the dermatology clinic
is under my wife's name.

187
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,430
I'd like to know more...

188
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:34,970
about the management or inheritance of the clinic.

189
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:38,300
To be honest, I'm curious about that process too.

190
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:41,871
Well, okay.

191
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,680
The first thing is...

192
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,540
clearing your name for this murder charge.

193
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,851
Excuse me.

194
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:55,290
You have to go down to the gym.

195
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,040
I'll go out first. Cover me.

196
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,710
Let's switch.
I'm better at handling the bat than you.

197
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,920
You were a pitcher.

198
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,261
If I didn't have the leg injury,

199
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,531
I would've played in the Major League.

200
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:41,371
Here we go.

201
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,601
Where did they all go?

202
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:14,901
They probably went back home.

203
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,940
The infected...

204
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:18,840
return to normal after a while.

205
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:21,611
What would go through their heads
once they saw what they did?

206
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,241
They would regret it...

207
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,810
and wouldn't be able to accept what they did.

208
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,310
Exactly.

209
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,351
They would want to go home and wash up.

210
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,281
The bloodstain at the entrance.

211
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,920
It looked like someone tried to wipe it off.

212
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,720
They wanted to erase what they had done.

213
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,131
Like wanting to drink people's blood...

214
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,661
and wanting to hide their thirst.

215
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,851
I didn't do it.

216
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,121
I just watched.

217
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:17,960
(Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok)

218
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,470
I should've asked for a walkie-talkie.

219
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,141
What do you think is happening outside?

220
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,911
It's highly likely to be chaotic
due to a flood of infected people.

221
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,781
- Or...
- Or what?

222
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,210
they gave up on this place.

223
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:58,241
We were planning to round up
the Next dealers in one go.

224
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,470
But they knew we were coming,

225
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,810
so they locked the door from the inside.

226
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,371
- How many people are in there?
- About 50 people.

227
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,411
They threw a member-only party.

228
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,781
We can open it in five minutes.

229
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,411
Turn off the music.

230
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Turn off the power for the club.

231
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:41,281
Don't open the door and block it.

232
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,751
And evacuate everyone from other floors.

233
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,720
Seal off the building.

234
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,320
Go upstairs and put out a sign.

235
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,440
If you need money,

236
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,111
take some from there too.

237
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,920
You're suddenly in a good mood.

238
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,491
Everyone outside our building got infected.

239
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,151
Is that good news?

240
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:24,090
I won't be going to prison.

241
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,621
I just need to look for a chance
to clear my name.

242
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,891
It sounds like you have a plan.

243
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,771
I just need the couple
from downstairs to keep quiet.

244
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,631
Once the blockade is lifted,
they'll start bothering me.

245
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,141
I should persuade them
before that happens.

246
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:38,940
Whatever happens,

247
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,840
you are on my side. Right?

248
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,080
Do I really have to go too?

249
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,981
You have to attend the meeting
at times like this...

250
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,580
to attract potential clients.

251
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,391
Honey, they said that our building was safe.

252
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,060
No. It's not because I'm scared or anything.

253
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:01,861
I just don't believe
that people outside our building got infected.

254
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,401
You sound pretty scared.

255
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,001
Are you attending the meeting?

256
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,371
I'm not really scared of the infected.

257
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,101
The residents in our building
might not be happy to see you.

258
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:15,440
A lot of people probably think
that our building was sealed off...

259
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,470
because of you.

260
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,911
I told you that I was innocent, didn't I?

261
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:21,981
What about Ms. Woo?

262
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,210
Ms. Woo...

263
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:24,920
cares about what people think...

264
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,550
just like your husband.

265
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,851
(Under maintenance)

266
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,991
Darn it.

267
00:16:58,481 --> 00:16:59,521
Ma'am.

268
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:02,720
Did you see something outside?

269
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,590
No.

270
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,391
You fell pretty hard that day.

271
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,761
Did you go to the hospital?

272
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,460
I'm all right.

273
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:14,970
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

274
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:19,601
That's the old lady
that bumped into our neighbour, right?

275
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,070
Yes. She lives in Unit 302.

276
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,641
Don't stay close to her.

277
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,781
You can get infected too.

278
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:26,741
No, I won't.

279
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,381
What are you doing?

280
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,751
Darn it. Those jerks.

281
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,090
Come on. Someone should go outside
and see what's going on...

282
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,361
even if it's dangerous out there.

283
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,590
Are you just going to stay in here?

284
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,131
The Internet is down too.

285
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,560
Come here.

286
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,761
- But...
- Sir.

287
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,631
I told you it's dangerous outside.

288
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,371
Everyone from other buildings
except for ours got infected.

289
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,770
Goodness. Darn it.

290
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,970
This is so frustrating. Gosh.

291
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,051
Goodness.

292
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,680
Why did you come down here?
You said you were out of energy.

293
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,881
Mom, are you sick?

294
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:07,621
No, I'm not.

295
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:10,051
I'm just a bit tired.

296
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,831
Gosh.

297
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,361
Well, I saw the bloodstains.

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,970
Are you sure there are patients outside?

299
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,740
Multiple people witnessed the scene.

300
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,071
Did you read that?

301
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,141
It says we should stay where we are.

302
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,641
Who are these witnesses?

303
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,990
Who on earth saw this flood
of infected people outside?

304
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Me. I saw them.

305
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,601
Are there any residents from the upper floors?

306
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,230
Other than the public rental units?

307
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,470
I'm only asking because there might be...

308
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,341
people who can make sound judgement
about this situation.

309
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:02,541
- Wait.
- Hey.

310
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:05,081
Who are you to question my brother's judgement?

311
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,881
You might think he's a nobody,
but he works at a company.

312
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,151
He's a senior manager.

313
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,780
Sure. I'm a lawyer.

314
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,480
My job is to evaluate
if their statement bears...

315
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:14,791
any merit as evidence.

316
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:17,561
You run your business at home
without an office. Correct?

317
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,161
I saw your ad in the elevator.

318
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,591
It's not just a business.
The clients come to me for help.

319
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't you speak Korean?

320
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:26,301
I'm a novelist.

321
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,030
What did you write?
What's your most famous piece?

322
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,301
- "Love Is Joint Property".
- Calm down.

323
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,000
- "I'll Be Working Out".
- Calm down!

324
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,301
Okay. Great.

325
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,740
I know you guys are all sensitive right now,

326
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
but we shouldn't fight amongst ourselves.

327
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:40,180
I didn't see any infected people either,

328
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,351
but since you guys are all saying the same thing...

329
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,780
Well...

330
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,651
I'll give you money.

331
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:53,561
To anyone who can figure out...

332
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:55,930
what's going on outside...

333
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:59,161
It's not much, but I'll give you...

334
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,770
200 dollars each.

335
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,240
If there are infected people outside,

336
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:06,371
we should stay inside.

337
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,770
We can divide up the food amongst ourselves.

338
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,311
- Until we can be sure...
- Right.

339
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:12,541
If you don't want to go outside,
I understand.

340
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,780
I'll...

341
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:22,420
I'll give you 6 bills.
That's 300 dollars in cash.

342
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,520
Okay?

343
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,891
No way.

344
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,940
Did you look everywhere?

345
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,440
This building is safe.

346
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,750
Can we turn on the elevators again?

347
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,780
Sure, go ahead.

348
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,250
But, ma'am?

349
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:02,131
If I were you,
I wouldn't get on the elevator.

350
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,561
If you're up against someone infected,

351
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,801
there's no place to escape.

352
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,041
I'm pretty sure I told you to stay at home.

353
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,670
Why?

354
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,611
When someone is arrested without a warrant,

355
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,680
they're usually released after 48 hours.

356
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,081
Does everyone know
that Oh Ju Hyung is a murderer?

357
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,551
You're making a huge mistake.

358
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,690
Do you have proof?

359
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,291
Did anyone see my wife...

360
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:34,930
wandering around out front?

361
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,000
I called an ambulance...

362
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:40,200
and brought her outside.

363
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:44,401
I admit that I wasn't able to protect my wife
until the end.

364
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,071
I'm in the most pain right now.

365
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:51,081
Is it such a huge crime to be unable
to protect my wife until the end?

366
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,280
You're also innocent until proven guilty.

367
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,220
You're lucky that our apartment was locked down.

368
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:03,020
Don't worry.
I'll stay in the apartment.

369
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:06,690
This place is no different than a detention center.

370
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,730
Hey, mister.
You have something on your shirt.

371
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,270
Don't you dare think about laying a hand
on the woman you're with.

372
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,601
I'll kill you.

373
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,780
What are you saying?
You're so uncultured.

374
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,551
How annoying.

375
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Hello.

376
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Let's go.

377
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:55,611
Be with all the families
who are suffering right now.

378
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,510
Please let them find peace...

379
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,081
- in you, My Lord.
- Hey. You're back.

380
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,551
- In the Lord's name. Amen.
- Amen.

381
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:06,151
Oh Ju Hyung got people to volunteer to go outside.

382
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,151
Is anyone willing to go outside?

383
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,091
When he offered them 300 dollars each,
they volunteered.

384
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,960
Honestly, I considered it too.

385
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,391
I'll give you 300 dollars each.

386
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,161
I said it was dangerous to go out at night,

387
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,161
so I managed to get it pushed back
to tomorrow morning.

388
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:21,700
Then what about today?

389
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,670
The people who came in today
need food and a place to sleep.

390
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,470
For everyone who came in from outside,

391
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,210
come to Unit 401 if you need food.

392
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,081
I'll give you some ramyeon and water.

393
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,950
Me too. I'm in Unit 602.

394
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,980
Do you have clothes to change into?

395
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,791
Everyone decided to pitch in and help them.

396
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:44,460
People are still generous.

397
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,591
What about Oh Ju Hyung?

398
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,831
Don't even bring him up.

399
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:52,801
He said he had nothing to eat at home,
so he had nothing to spare.

400
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:55,530
I don't know why I even bothered to ask.

401
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:58,371
You can come by again.

402
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:03,311
But why won't you go outside?

403
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,881
It doesn't seem like you believe...

404
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,911
that there are infected people outside,

405
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,450
so you should go out
and find out for yourselves.

406
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:12,151
I have a specialized profession.

407
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,321
I can't go out for that kind of money.

408
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,121
How about 1,000 dollars
without withholding tax?

409
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,190
What do you say?

410
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,960
Oh Ju Hyung. Stop teasing people with money.

411
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:30,071
Let's go.

412
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,770
Okay. Go on in and get some rest.

413
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,411
What does that punk take me for?

414
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,280
Darn it!

415
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:54,831
Why did you stop me?
I was about to kill him.

416
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:59,430
Honey. What's the point
of getting involved with that lunatic?

417
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,500
Should we refuse to help him?

418
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,811
The dermatology clinic
is under my wife's name.

419
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:11,311
I'd like to know more...

420
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:12,541
That jerk...

421
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,280
If he gets to be too much,
we'll just send him to prison.

422
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,821
We just need to make money.

423
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,361
(I'm okay, so if you see this,
don't worry.)

424
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:32,561
- Oh, my.
- Here.

425
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't know if this is enough.
It's heavy.

426
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,230
Right. Thank you so much.

427
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:39,641
We'll clean your apartment
before we leave.

428
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,210
No, it's okay. I live alone,
so it's clean.

429
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,341
Don't worry about me and get some rest.

430
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:45,841
- Right. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

431
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,581
- Thank you for the food.
- Goodbye.

432
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:48,651
Goodbye.

433
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:59,891
Why did you do that earlier?

434
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
What?

435
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,190
You took my side.

436
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,861
I'm the only one who can curse you out.

437
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,700
It would make me mad to hear someone else do it.

438
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,970
Right? We are family after all.

439
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:14,871
Yes, but even still,
I refuse to give you my apartment.

440
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:20,111
She's so cold.

441
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:25,920
(I'm okay, so if you see this,
don't worry.)

442
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,690
(I'm with Hyun Kyung.
Let's get a dog if we live here.)

443
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,291
Where were you going to go?

444
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,901
I'm sure you knew
you couldn't leave the apartment.

445
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,700
I told you.

446
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,700
I really left something in my car.

447
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,901
- Did you take the drug?
- Did you drink water?

448
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:49,841
I didn't.

449
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:53,240
I really don't know anything about that.

450
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:55,811
Oh, my.

451
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:58,051
What?

452
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,480
You're avoiding my eyes,

453
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,520
so you must be hiding something.

454
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,220
If I'm being completely honest,

455
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,631
I am hiding something.

456
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,700
But it has nothing to do with the two of you.

457
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:15,071
You did drink water.

458
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:27,480
How can a human survive...

459
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:29,911
without drinking any water?

460
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,180
How?

461
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,831
Cut your nails.
I'm going to check tomorrow.

462
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,430
If you tell me who bought drugs from you,

463
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:46,861
I'll find a way for you to be more comfortable.

464
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,970
When I get out of here,

465
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,371
I'm going to report you guys.

466
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:52,871
I'm serious.

467
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,470
If you get out of here safely,

468
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,071
you're free to do whatever you want.

469
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,611
Think about it carefully.

470
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:18,861
There we go.

471
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,331
Okay.

472
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,770
Check the expiration date.
It could be expired.

473
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:27,101
My goodness. What's up with you?

474
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,311
Why would expired food
be in someone's home?

475
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:32,440
Do you keep that on
even when you eat?

476
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,041
Stop being like that.

477
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,950
Who is it?

478
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:38,680
- What?
- Who is it?

479
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,651
Oh, hello.

480
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:45,420
I'm sorry, but can she stay with you
for the time being?

481
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,690
The cleaning ladies' quarters
are in the basement garage,

482
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,030
and she's too scared to go down there.

483
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:53,331
Oh, right. Of course.

484
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,470
That's good.

485
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,071
Thank you.

486
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,500
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

487
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,280
- Have a seat.
- Come on in.

488
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:11,450
We were just about to have some ramyeon.

489
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,891
Here. Have some.

490
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,331
Thank you.

491
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:25,430
Okay.

492
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:29,901
Oh, my.

493
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:42,081
Slow down. It's hot.

494
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,851
It's been such a long day.

495
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,121
How will we get through tomorrow?

496
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:50,750
Shouldn't we stop them from leaving?

497
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:51,891
How?

498
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:54,020
Block the entrance
and don't let them through?

499
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,831
Then they'll leave through the basement.

500
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,661
We can't stop them alone.

501
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:01,061
It might be better to stay indoors
for a week.

502
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,700
We have food,

503
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,470
and it's not like the infected
can come through the windows.

504
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,071
What if things don't get better in a week?

505
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:10,010
Then we eat less.

506
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,780
Don't tell Seo Yoon.

507
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,020
Scaring her won't help.

508
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:20,450
Okay.

509
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:31,661
Sae Bom. Is it true
that the infected are everywhere?

510
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:33,230
What?

511
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,301
Well,

512
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:38,101
that's another building, not ours.

513
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,710
It's just our complex.
The rest of the world is fine.

514
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:46,980
Was it meant to be a secret?

515
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,480
- You should've said so.
- Jung Guk.

516
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:51,551
We must talk. Come here.

517
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,420
I just...

518
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,621
When communications are back up,

519
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,361
you can talk to your mom again.

520
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,861
Let's stay indoors until then.

521
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,490
We can leave when help comes.

522
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:05,960
We'll all get better
once a vaccine is developed.

523
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,071
Let's wait, okay?

524
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm fine.

525
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:12,101
I'm not hurt,

526
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,940
and it's better outside than in here.

527
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,440
My mom and dad will be okay.

528
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,980
That's right.

529
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,780
- Good girl.
- Seo Yoon.

530
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:33,821
(Mom)

531
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,690
(Message not sent)

532
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,430
The mad person virus,

533
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,270
also called the Lytta Virus...

534
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,141
is a neurotropic virus similar to rabies.

535
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,071
It travels via the central nerves
and affects the brain.

536
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,411
Infection is caused
when the virus directly enters the bloodstream,

537
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,510
and the sick show no symptoms
until it reaches the brain.

538
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,851
We believe the infected target necks to reduce...

539
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:00,520
the time the virus takes to reach the brain.

540
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,791
Are we okay as long as we aren't bitten?

541
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:06,520
Currently, we're aware of
three methods of infection.

542
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,291
You're bitten, scratched,

543
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,030
or you take Next.

544
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:14,500
We believe the infection
originated from Next takers.

545
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:16,230
How about a cure?

546
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:19,641
The problem is,

547
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:22,670
the brain is the most important organ,

548
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,811
and it's protected...

549
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:27,180
by something called BBB,
the Blood Brain Barrier.

550
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,210
Even if we develop a cure,

551
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,121
it cannot get through the barrier
to reach the brain.

552
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,381
So...

553
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,051
there is no cure?

554
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,631
With a lab-grown live attenuated virus,

555
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,341
we're developing antibodies
that'll work directly on the brain.

556
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:54,470
We'll have an answer within a month.

557
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,180
Can we hold out until then?

558
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:00,081
As of right now, we believe so.

559
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,240
However...

560
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,051
if we give up on active cohort isolation,

561
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,851
and the infected reach a certain number,

562
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,020
within 72 hours, one week at the most,

563
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,260
we will all be infected.

564
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,960
(Confirmed Lytta Virus Cases in Korea)

565
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,141
(Lytta Virus Cases: 1,721,699)

566
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:45,361
Talk.

567
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,490
You must be aware
we can't grow anything in a lab.

568
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,460
All our test subjects died
without forming antibodies.

569
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,401
Should I have said a cure was impossible?

570
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,901
If you say we need a little more time and funds...

571
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,841
Then they'd have said
we should kill all those infected.

572
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,641
If confirmed cases increase
with no hope for a cure,

573
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,541
slaughtering is the only option.

574
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,480
I thought...

575
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,720
you didn't think the infected were human.

576
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,260
If they bite and kill someone,

577
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:23,631
they must be responsible.

578
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,030
Don't you think?

579
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,101
We must buy more time.

580
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,230
Cordon off a larger area if we must.

581
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,000
To save more people, right now,

582
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:36,940
that's the only way.

583
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,520
While we do that,

584
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:49,420
we hope we find an answer.

(Personnel File: Yoon Sae Bom)

00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,581
It's not working.

(Mom, you be happy too.)

589
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:31,391
I even said I should do something.

Yi Hyun.

591
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,530
What's that?

592
00:36:11,331 --> 00:36:12,470
A catcher's protective gear.

593
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,441
Is Seo Yoon still asleep?

594
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,021
I'm a detective.

595
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:33,791
I can't sit and do nothing.

596
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,990
We're in quarantine ourselves.

597
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,661
We aren't here because we're cops.

598
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,900
And you won't get paid extra for doing this.

599
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,430
No, but...

600
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:46,501
There must be healthy people
in the other buildings.

601
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,771
We should see if we can help them.

602
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,641
Try to help yourself first.

603
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:52,840
You can't run fast because of your bad knee.

604
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:56,010
Still, I'm faster than middle-aged men.

- Are you serious?
- You'll wake her.

607
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,950
Did you sleep well?

608
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,720
Seo Yoon. Stay in bed.

609
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:07,820
You won't grow tall
if you get right out of bed.

610
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,231
Go back to bed.

611
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,391
Good morning.

612
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,001
You're not coming?

613
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,171
No.

614
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,470
I avoid dangerous places
because it's dangerous.

615
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,671

616
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,450
Hey.

617
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,211
Walk over me first.

618
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,450
Is it me or the residents?

619
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,751
Will you stop it?

620
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:40,561
There's nothing out there.

621
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:41,961
They're all mistaken.

How many times must I tell you?

- Think of our kid.
- My gosh.

Thank you.

631
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,921
Pay us too.

632
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,130
You said there was infected people.

633
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:17,191
Exactly.

634
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,661
As a civil servant, I must do my part.

635
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,430
I hope the government pays you well.

636
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:25,641
His pay too.

637
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,200
Do you want cash?

Sorry.

641
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,490
But it's illegal to take handouts.

642
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,650
Will you put this on?

643
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,570
I will lead you.

644

concerned about the disease
and are saddened by it.

Please cure the sick.

651
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:35,271
Please comfort the families in sorrow.

652
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,811
- Please help them...
- Amen.

653
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,280
find peace.

654
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,150
Gosh. Be quiet. That's enough.

655
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:43,811
Don't touch me.

656
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,921
- Lord.
- What?

657
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,220
- What did you just say?
- Please...

658
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,791
Don't touch me!

659
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:54,391
- Gosh.
- Has she gone mad?

660
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,191
Goodness.

661
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,800
Hey, where are you going now?

662
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:05,871
Hey! That punk.

663
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:10,771
Goodness.
What a messed-up family this is.

664
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,461
Be careful.

665
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,130
There's really nobody here.

666
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,871
What if they all left?

667
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:48,950
(SY Home Cleaning)

668
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,650
Hello.

669
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,090
I want to help too.

670
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,360
So you can upload the video?

671
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,731
Gosh, no. I'll get your permission
before I upload it.

672
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,161
I promise. Okay?

673
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Hello.

674
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,601
Let's make this quick.

675
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,141
Follow me.

676
00:41:58,411 --> 00:42:00,280
Are you all right?

677
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,621
I heard you were infected.

678
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,291
There was an internal problem.

679
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,900
There was a suspected carrier during the meeting.

680
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,831
So the suspected carrier is locked up
in the children's library.

681
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,700
Wasn't there an infected person
in your building as well?

682
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:22,470
Is she all right?

683
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:26,141
Did her condition get worse or something?

684
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Sir.

685
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,490
Don't you remember me?

686
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,161
Of course, I do.

687
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,320
You pointed your gun at me yesterday morning.

688
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,490
No, after that...

689
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,090
Then...

690
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:48,561
are people from other buildings safe
other than the suspected carrier?

691
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,470
Yes. I told them to stay at home.

692
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,041
A few of us are in charge
of communicating with the outside.

693
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:57,641
Excuse me. What are you filming?

694
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:08,621
Then you didn't get the boxed meals?

695
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:10,950
We've been waiting,
but we haven't gotten them yet.

696
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:13,561
Maybe, something is going on outside too.

697
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,800
Hey! Is anyone there?

698
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:26,271
- Honey.
- Gosh.

699
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Gosh.

700
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,990
Are you going to stay here?

701
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:43,921
We should.

702
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,220
Go ahead.

703
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:49,831
We'll get going then.

704
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:08,610
What are they doing there?

705
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:10,880
They want to leave...

706
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,880
because they are scared
in case their symptoms come back.

707
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,421
And if they can't suppress their thirst,

708
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:17,351
they'll find other victims.

709
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:20,521
What do we do now?

710
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:22,530
The supermarket.

711
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,030
We need as much food as we can get.

712
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:31,227
Are you really infected?

713
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:33,267
Do you really have the mad person disease?

714
00:44:33,866 --> 00:44:35,196
No, I don't.

715
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:38,096
When you were in the States, you smoked pot.

716
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:39,937
You're still doing drugs here?

717
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:41,366
I really didn't do drugs!

718
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:42,937
You punk.

719
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:45,506
I got you a job here,
so you can get close to the residents.

720
00:44:45,577 --> 00:44:47,776
But you did drugs here? You jerk.

721
00:44:48,546 --> 00:44:49,546
Yeon Ok.

722
00:44:49,716 --> 00:44:50,716
You.

723
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:54,046
From this point on,
we never knew each other.

724
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:03,696
Is it really dangerous outside?

725
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:05,497
If I were you,

726
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:07,897
I would never leave.

727
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:17,107
(Gym)

728
00:45:18,307 --> 00:45:21,176
Everyone is useless here. Darn it.

729
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:25,787
If I were you,
I wouldn't get on the elevator.

730
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,147
If you're up against someone infected,

731
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:29,417
there's no place to escape.

732
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:48,037
No way.

733
00:45:48,837 --> 00:45:50,877
There's no way
people can possibly turn into...

734
00:45:51,276 --> 00:45:53,207
Ma'am! Open up.

735
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:56,116
There are patients in other buildings.

736
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:58,247
- Really?
- Yes. Hurry.

737
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:05,486
I have some news from outside too.

738
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:06,986
It's chaotic there.

739
00:46:08,526 --> 00:46:09,656
Okay.

740
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,937
By the way, are you hurt?

741
00:46:15,997 --> 00:46:17,497
Your neck.

742
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,636
I got scratched.

743
00:46:19,866 --> 00:46:21,037
Open up now.

744
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:23,176
Wait.

745
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:26,506
Gosh.

746
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:29,017
Darn it.

747
00:46:31,647 --> 00:46:34,386
Some unique behaviours are present
before the disease develops.

748
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,357
They get extremely thirsty...

749
00:46:38,986 --> 00:46:41,886
They also partake in compulsive behaviours such as...

750
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:43,756
knocking on the walls
when they're alone.

751
00:46:44,926 --> 00:46:45,926
Are you...

752
00:46:48,426 --> 00:46:49,667
thirsty?

753
00:47:34,846 --> 00:47:38,147
By the way, those people seemed a bit off.

754
00:47:38,216 --> 00:47:39,616
But they didn't seem infected.

755
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:41,216
Shouldn't we...

756
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,716
have waited for the boxed meals as well?

757
00:47:43,787 --> 00:47:45,357
You can go back there and wait with them.

758
00:47:45,827 --> 00:47:47,357
- Let's get some food first.
- Okay.

759
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:53,096
Wait. You should get more water than food.

760
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:05,006
How should we pay for this?

761
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:11,017
You are a way more honest
than I give you credit for.

762
00:48:12,716 --> 00:48:13,747
No, I'm not.

763
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:15,287
Of course, you are.

764
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:18,386
I'm just doing my best to follow the rules.

765
00:48:18,656 --> 00:48:21,687
Once I cross the line,
my line might get really blurry.

766
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:25,796
I see. Mr. Honest.

767
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:28,696
Gosh. You are so honest.

768
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:29,796
What are you? A saint?

769
00:48:30,397 --> 00:48:31,497
I better watch myself around you.

770
00:48:58,357 --> 00:48:59,997
It's okay. Calm down.

771
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:01,696
Calm down.

772
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,537
No. Over there.

773
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:07,267
No, that one.

774
00:49:08,736 --> 00:49:09,837
Ice cream.

775
00:49:11,307 --> 00:49:12,377
Get water.

776
00:49:12,707 --> 00:49:14,906
- Over here!
- Okay.

777
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:20,386
It's so heavy.

778
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:04,196
What are you doing?

779
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:09,497
What is it?

780
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:10,636
Oh, no.

781
00:50:25,446 --> 00:50:26,587
Hold on.

782
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:28,687
Let's go.

783
00:50:44,096 --> 00:50:45,566
Dong Destroyers.

784
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:46,906
It's Dong Hyun.

785
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,207
I'm in the supermarket,

786
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:51,877
and there's a trail of blood in here.

787
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:55,747
My goodness.

788
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:59,287
I'm putting myself in danger for you guys.

789
00:50:59,346 --> 00:51:01,946
I will film something really interesting
for you all.

790
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:05,287
I love you guys.

791
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:19,267
Miss. What are you doing in there?

792
00:51:20,037 --> 00:51:21,107
Miss.

793
00:52:09,986 --> 00:52:11,057
Be quiet.

794
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:16,156
Here, they use the verbal phrase "Take a look".

795
00:52:16,227 --> 00:52:17,727
This phrase...

796
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:20,227
People suddenly rushed in here.

797
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:23,837
All of their eyes looked weird.

798
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:26,667
I was so scared, so I hid in here.

799
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:28,107
What about the infected?

800
00:52:28,267 --> 00:52:29,377
Did they leave?

801
00:52:30,307 --> 00:52:31,477
I don't know.

802
00:52:33,176 --> 00:52:34,276
Let's go.

803
00:52:37,216 --> 00:52:38,616
Hurry.

804
00:52:39,216 --> 00:52:40,287
Oh, my.

805
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:42,917
Hurry. Let's go.

806
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:45,557
There's...

807
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:47,926
blood inside there.

808
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:50,156
We should go. What about the others?

809
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:51,997
I don't know.

810
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:05,207
Run!

811
00:53:28,426 --> 00:53:30,167
- Why not?
- There are people inside.

812
00:53:30,366 --> 00:53:31,466
Hey!

813
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:33,267
We can't just leave them here!

814
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:34,466
Let's go together.

815
00:53:37,276 --> 00:53:38,577
Over here! Hurry!

816
00:53:47,886 --> 00:53:48,946
Darn it!

817
00:54:11,537 --> 00:54:12,707
What are you doing? Let's go!

818
00:54:31,444 --> 00:54:32,504
Mister.

819
00:54:33,644 --> 00:54:34,944
Go to the first floor.

820
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:37,084
Why?

821
00:54:37,343 --> 00:54:39,783
Sae Bom said if they weren't back
by 10 o'clock,

822
00:54:39,783 --> 00:54:41,153
we should go downstairs.

823
00:54:44,984 --> 00:54:45,993
Okay.

824
00:54:49,894 --> 00:54:51,964
You really saw it?

825
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:54,234
I'm telling you I did.

826
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:56,734
Why did they go out
when it's so dangerous?

827
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:01,874
What if they all get infected?

828
00:55:03,703 --> 00:55:04,843
Right.

829
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:15,453
If I can't be sure that it's safe,

830
00:55:16,424 --> 00:55:18,183
I can't open this door.

831
00:55:19,053 --> 00:55:20,153
Okay.

832
00:55:21,024 --> 00:55:22,553
Go ahead.

833
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:25,723
That lady...

834
00:55:25,794 --> 00:55:27,433
is just like me.

835
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:36,044
Open the door!

836
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:37,544
Hurry!

837
00:55:37,973 --> 00:55:39,073
What are you doing?
Open the door!

838
00:55:39,174 --> 00:55:40,374
Was anyone infected?

839
00:55:40,444 --> 00:55:41,544
Open the door!

840
00:55:43,814 --> 00:55:45,843
Each of you come close
so that I can get a look at you.

841
00:55:45,914 --> 00:55:47,254
Hurry up and open the door!

842
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:50,484
Why do you have blood on your face?

843
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:51,783
Did you get bitten?

844
00:55:51,883 --> 00:55:52,924
Open the door! Hurry!

845
00:55:52,993 --> 00:55:54,124
No, I can't!

846
00:55:54,254 --> 00:55:55,854
Hurry up and open the door.
Open it!

847
00:55:56,024 --> 00:55:57,223
Did you get bitten?

848
00:55:57,294 --> 00:55:58,323
Open the door!

849
00:55:58,394 --> 00:56:00,464
We're all okay!
Hurry up and open the door!

850
00:56:00,964 --> 00:56:02,533
Open the door.

851
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,734
Open the door, mister!

852
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:07,234
- Open the door. Hurry.
- No.

853
00:56:09,544 --> 00:56:10,903
Open the door!

854
00:56:11,073 --> 00:56:12,944
Hurry up and open it! Please.

855
00:56:13,644 --> 00:56:15,144
Do you want me to break it open?

856
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:19,953
Open it.

857
00:56:20,354 --> 00:56:21,883
Open!

858
00:56:22,683 --> 00:56:24,084
What's that sound?

859
00:56:25,254 --> 00:56:27,194
- Open the door.
- The sound that Min Ji made.

860
00:56:27,254 --> 00:56:29,464
- Hey, lady!
- What are you doing with that?

861
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:30,624
Hurry up and open the door.

862
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:31,894
Didn't I tell you?

863
00:56:31,964 --> 00:56:33,493
We just needed to convince the couple downstairs.

864
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,194
- Dead people can't talk.
- Open the door!

865
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:37,363
Corpses can't speak.

866
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:39,064
No.

867
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:41,203
Hurry up and open the door.

868
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:23,214
Open the door right now.

869
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:25,444
The infected can't get inside!

870
00:57:25,914 --> 00:57:27,383
Open the door!

871
00:57:28,283 --> 00:57:29,354
Hurry up and open it!

872
00:57:29,424 --> 00:57:30,984
I won't!

873
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:33,794
Let us in!

874
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:35,323
What the heck.

875
00:57:35,593 --> 00:57:37,323
- Move!
- Open the door!

876
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:38,863
- Don't!
- Darn you.

877
00:57:39,363 --> 00:57:41,294
- Shoot.
- Hey!

878
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:43,234
Turn it off.

879
00:57:43,303 --> 00:57:44,604
Let's go, honey.

880
00:57:44,664 --> 00:57:46,073
- Open the door!
- Let us in.

881
00:57:46,174 --> 00:57:47,734
Open the door now.

882
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:49,334
Let us in.

883
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:50,774
Open it now!

884
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,504
- Let us in.
- Open the door!

885
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:53,843
No!

886
00:57:55,174 --> 00:57:57,544
Sae Bom, hurry!

887
00:57:57,743 --> 00:57:58,743
Open the door.

888
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:04,124
Darn you!

889
00:58:05,223 --> 00:58:07,524
- How could you?
- Don't.

890
00:58:07,593 --> 00:58:09,564
Calm down and move fast.

891
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:11,294
- Get in, quick!
- You first.

892
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,933
Let's move it.

893
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,993
- Get off me!
- Darn you.

894
00:58:15,064 --> 00:58:17,334
Get your hands off me!

895
00:58:17,403 --> 00:58:19,004
You could've killed us all.

896
00:58:19,064 --> 00:58:20,334
Don't.

897
00:58:20,403 --> 00:58:21,734
- Darn you.
- Stop it!

898
00:58:21,803 --> 00:58:23,444
Will you stop it?

899
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:25,473
- Come at me!
- Please, stop!

900
00:58:25,504 --> 00:58:27,044
Turn this off!

901
00:58:27,914 --> 00:58:29,613
Will you please calm down?

902
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:30,984
Get off her!

903
00:58:38,854 --> 00:58:40,053
It was Oh Ju Hyung.

904
00:58:55,334 --> 00:58:57,444
What a pity.

905
00:58:57,843 --> 00:58:59,403
It was a great opportunity.

906
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:00,944
Too bad.

907
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,984
What's with the long face?

908
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:05,743
I didn't do anything.

909
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:07,584
I did nothing wrong.

910
00:59:08,484 --> 00:59:09,584
Oh Ju Hyung!

911
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:15,124
Did you bring my phone with you?

912
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:22,133
What's going on?

913
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:24,933
Darn you.

914
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:27,674
What?

915
00:59:28,073 --> 00:59:30,544
What are the charges this time?

916
00:59:38,883 --> 00:59:39,883
Are you crazy?

917
00:59:43,283 --> 00:59:45,183
This is blood from the outside.

918
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:47,524
Now you're scared?

919
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:50,394
Are you afraid now?

920
00:59:50,464 --> 00:59:52,323
You scumbag!

921
00:59:58,203 --> 00:59:59,403
Yi Hyun, stop it.

922
01:00:18,924 --> 01:00:21,653
Once the Internet's back up,
I will become famous.

923
01:00:36,374 --> 01:00:38,144
Darn it.

924
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,533
Sorry.

925
01:01:04,604 --> 01:01:05,863
I got carried away.

926
01:01:07,234 --> 01:01:08,573
If not for you,

927
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:11,403
everyone with us would've gotten infected.

928
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:21,653
Good job, Yi Hyun.

929
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:40,703
The mayor must apologize!

930
01:01:40,774 --> 01:01:42,803
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

931
01:01:42,874 --> 01:01:44,743
Cancel the quarantine!

932
01:01:44,803 --> 01:01:46,944
- Cancel!
- Cancel!

933
01:01:47,013 --> 01:01:49,044
Protect our livelihoods!

934
01:01:49,144 --> 01:01:51,044
- Protect!
- Protect!

935
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:53,013
We demand compensation!

936
01:01:54,283 --> 01:01:57,084
Sir. An infected individual
got out of the complex.

937
01:01:57,524 --> 01:01:58,584
He's showing symptoms.

938
01:01:58,984 --> 01:02:00,153
Shall I bring him in?

939
01:02:00,223 --> 01:02:02,323
(We didn't agree to this!)

940
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:04,024
Let him loose.

941
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:05,124
Pardon?

942
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:10,633
Let him go as if he got away
so that the protesters see him.

943
01:02:12,633 --> 01:02:14,933
Just make sure no one's hurt.

944
01:02:15,473 --> 01:02:16,473
Sir.

945
01:02:16,674 --> 01:02:18,874
The infected must not be pitied.

946
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,714
They must be feared and avoided.

947
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:24,914
That's how we buy time
until we develop antibodies.

948
01:02:36,694 --> 01:02:41,394
=Happiness=

949
01:02:57,914 --> 01:02:59,343
The residents...

950
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:01,914
are all highly strung.

951
01:03:01,984 --> 01:03:04,453
I want to buy those pills.

952
01:03:04,524 --> 01:03:06,894
Yes, that's it.

953
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:11,263
Change the way you think
and there are endless options.

954
01:03:11,823 --> 01:03:14,033
The situation will get even worse.

955
01:03:14,263 --> 01:03:15,334
We must make them leave.

956
01:03:15,763 --> 01:03:17,004
That's how we'll survive.

957
01:03:17,403 --> 01:03:19,433
- The buyer.
- The 15th floor.

958
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,433
We wait for the infected to die off?

959
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,843
If you hurt Sae Bom...

960
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:26,613
I will kill you.
