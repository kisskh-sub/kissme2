The one set aside for the police.

81

I remember. It's based on
your performance evaluation.

83

Wait. So... You're getting married

86
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,780
for the points?

87
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Yes.

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
With whom?

89
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,140
This guy who asked me out
when I was young.

90
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,060
I had turned him down back then,

91
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,780
but I asked just in case
he was still interested.

92
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,460
It's not because I have
no respect for you.

93
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
It's because

94
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,220
it has always been a dream

95
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620

98

Thank you.

99

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,340
She's so cold. Very cold.

101
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,140
Are you short on points?

102
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Yes, but...

103
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,460
I only suggested it
because I'm interested in you.

104
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,540
You're decent looking
and can provide for yourself.

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,580
Hey. I'm a better catch than you think.

106
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,420
Being two years older is nothing.

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,820
And it's a new construction.

108
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,700
You'll regret missing out.

109
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,180
Hey. You won't find a friend like me

110
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,340
anywhere else.

111
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
Fine.

112
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
I'm asking you

113
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,540
to marry me.

114
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,460
I know.

115
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,220
I said okay.

116
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580

117
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,580

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,620
It's a gift.

169
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,700
My wife started a new business.

170
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,620
Don't worry. She's fine now.
She's healthy.

171
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,860
We can do takeout and delivery.

172
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,380
Give it out in your building.

173
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,820
It'll only be hard for your wife.

174
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,060
You should make some...

175
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,220
Also,

176
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,140
remember how you asked me
to dig into Han Tae-seok?

177
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,500
I'll spread the word.
What did you find out?

178
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,580
He's an infectious disease specialist.

179
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,260
There's a program that sends
military academy students

180
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,060
for training at med school.

181
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,620
He got a medical license and was
a medical officer until he was discharged.

182
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,540
Then he worked
at a pharmaceutical company.

183
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,140
He was a manager for
increasing competitiveness

184
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,220
or something like that. And look...

185
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,020
(Han Tae-seok
sued for assaulting Chairman Choi Seok-ju)

186
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,900
From when he was in trial for assaulting
the chairman of a pharma company.

187
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,380
(Han Tae-seok
sued for assaulting Chairman Choi Seok-ju)

188
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,020
He didn't look like the type.

189
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,900
The calm ones are scarier

190
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,380
when they snap.

191
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Anyway, he was found not guilty
and then he returned to the military.

192
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,060
To Central Disaster Countermeasures.

193
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
That's odd.

194
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,780
Stay away from him as much as possible.

195
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,340
You may get hit by a stray bullet.

196
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Got it.

197
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,060
-Bye.
-Hey.

198
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,380
Let me know if you run out of rice cakes.

199
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,780
-Okay.
-Later.

200
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,700
I want to stay away from him too,

201
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,220
but I have a feeling I won't be able to.

202
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,060
(Le Ciel, Welcome new residents)

203
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,180
Well...

204
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,740
I keep thinking about that trainee

205
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,020
that I had administered first aid to.

206
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,260
Why?

207
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,180
He isn't doing well.

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,380
The same as Lee Jong-tae.

209
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,660
Even his family can't visit.

210
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,660
I asked guys who were dispatched to CDCH,
and they said

211
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,540
once you go in,

212
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,380
you don't come out alive.

213
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,980
I did.

214
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,580
Yes.

215
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,460
Only you.

216
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,300
You were the only one.

217
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,420
Will they be okay?

218
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,180
What if they all die in there?

219
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,220
Finding happiness

220
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,260
is hard.

221
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,180
You scared me.

222
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,980
Sorry. You should be careful.

223
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,780
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

224
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,660
That startled me.

225
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,180
Fifth floor please. Thank you.

226
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,660
Please wear a mask when you're indoors.

227
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,540
Okay. Sorry.

228
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,620
That jacket.

229
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,500
Where did you get that?

230
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,820
It looks authentic.

231
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,620
I'm in Special Ops.

232
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,420
Really?

233
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,220
You're really in Special Ops?

234
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,860
You're an anti-terrorism tactical agent?

235
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,860
Yes.

236
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,540
Can you get me a t-shirt

237
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,300
from Special Ops?

238
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,860
One with "SOU" on the front
and "Special Operation Unit" on the back.

239
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,540
In large.

240
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,380
I'll look into it. You wanted a large?

241
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,660
Yes, please. I'd really appreciate it.

242
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,260
I'm on the 15th floor.

243
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,860
What a character.

244
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,180
You're home early.

245
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,500
We moved.
We have to eat jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.

246
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,220
I expected as much
and looked up restaurants nearby.

247
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,420
There was a photo from that day?

248
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,300
Jung-guk had the file.

249
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,540
Wow.

250
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,940
So I had it blown up.

251
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,500
Don't you like it?

252
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Well...

253
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,420
But...

254
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,820
This wasn't that great a memory for you.

255
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,940
Do you like it?

256
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Hey!

257
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,060
Stand straight.

258
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,420
Here we go.

259
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,580
One, two, three.

260
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,660
Look at this whenever life gets tough
and hang on.

261
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,220
Okay.

262
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,580
You said the district office may come
to inspect us

263
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,620
to see if we're really married.

264
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,260
This should suffice

265
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,940
to explain why we got married.

266
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,060
It is a very strong motive.

267
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,700
Right. It looks like
we have quite a story.

268
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,740
I like the handcuffs.

269
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,780
When else would I be handcuffed?

270
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,500
Are you giving out rice cakes?

271
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,100
It's Jung-guk's side business.

272
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,380
He asked me to spread the word.

273
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,660
-I'll give them out...
-No.

274
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,860
I'll do it.

275
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,180
You should unpack

276
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,140
and order jjajangmyeon.
I want an extra-large serving.

277
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,380
Okay.

278
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,100
Be careful.

279
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,220
Okay.

280
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,540
(Who is it?)

281
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,460
I moved in across the hall.
Are your parents home?

282
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,580
Hi.

283
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,100
Thank you.

284
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,380
Bye.

285
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,460
It won't open.

286
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,020
The floors below this are public housing.

287
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,140
The floors above are regular.

288
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,900
They blocked the doors
so people from below couldn't go up.

289
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,540
How do you know all that?

290
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,740
I know everything.

291
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,860
The other kids at school call
public housing kids poor.

292
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,020
How do people come down from above?

293
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,300
There's an elevator.

294
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,260
I see.

295
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,980
Are you going downstairs?

296
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Yes.

297
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,340
One house is empty

298
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,100
and a lady lives alone in the other,

299
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,540
but she didn't come home yesterday.

300
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,100
You know everything, don't you?

301
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,500
That's better.

302
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,300
Come on.

303
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,300
Is it okay to do that?

304
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,100
Yes. Blocking the emergency door
is against the fire code.

305
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,460
If someone says something about it,
I'll just report them.

306
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,540
I see.

307
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,700
See you around.

308
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Insurance companies always ask for 50, 50.

309
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,940
Maintaining a safe distance,
duty to look ahead, and such. Right?

310
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,660
Ignore what all those parrots say.

311
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,940
I saw the footage

312
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,580
and 90 to 10 is totally possible.

313
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,780
I'm from Unit 501.

314
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,900
I moved in today. Here's a greeting gift.

315
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,820
Just a minute, sir.

316
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,620
Since we're neighbors,
consultations will be free.

317
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,060
Please come by any time.

318
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,380
Okay.

319
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,260
Yes, I think that's fine.

320
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,540
(Lawyer Kook Hae-seong will appear
with a bang in difficult moments)

321
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,540
"Lawyer Kook Hae-seong
will appear with a bang"

322
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,940
"in difficult moments."

323
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,220
(Lawyer Kook Hae-seong will appear
with a bang in difficult moments)

324
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,380
That's separate. Yes.

325
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,580
(Quit Chat)
That's separate. Yes.

326
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:09,860
(Quit Chat)

327
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,380
(What do I have to do to become a lawyer?)

328
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,500
(What do I have to do to become a lawyer?)
Yes, call me again after you check it.

329
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,340
Yes, call me again after you check it.

330
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:13,980
(Park Chan-hyeok)

331
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,420
(Park Chan-hyeok)
I think that's a separate matter.

332
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:14,500
I think that's a separate matter.

333
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,740
(It's a hit-and-run. I didn't do it, my friend did.)
I think that's a separate matter.

334
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,380
(It was late at night.)

335
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,540
(It was late at night.)
Yes.

336
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:16,620
Yes.

337
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,340
(There weren't any cameras.)
Yes.

338
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,740
(There weren't any cameras.)

339
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,180
(They think they hit someone.)
Of course. Call me any time.

340
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,260
Of course. Call me any time.

341
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,420
(How can I know if it's been reported?)
Of course. Call me any time.

342
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:19,460
(How can I know if it's been reported?)

343
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,780
Yes, thank you.

344
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,100
Yes.

345
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,140
(Is your friend going to turn themself in?)
Yes.

346
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,580
(Is your friend going to turn themself in?)

347
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,660
-Who was it?
-Downstairs neighbor.

348
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,500
She moved in.

349
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,420
And? You're throwing food away?

350
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,460
How can someone, who was my secretary

351
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,620
and now my wife, trust people so easily?

352
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,340
You shouldn't eat what strangers give you.

353
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,540
So you're saying
the woman living downstairs

354
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,300
gave us poisoned food to kill us.

355
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,380
Honey, you have an illness.

356
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,700
So-yoon, I was a public defender.

357
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,580
I became aware of the malice
in humans really early.

358
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,620
Right. As a public defender,
go and give the client consultation.

359
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,620
I think he needs a lawyer.

360
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,820
Come on.

361
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,540
(Will my friend get caught if they don't?)

362
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,300
(Will my friend get caught if they don't?)
Of course, they will, you punk.

363
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,580
Of course, they will, you punk.

364
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,820
The police are probably
on their way to your house right now.

365
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
What is it?

366
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,620
(I'll have to see if the accident
has been reported first.)

367
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,020
(Can I get in touch with your friend?
And as quickly as possible.)

368
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
Who are you?

369
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,420
Hello.

370
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,300
I moved in downstairs.
I came to give you some rice cakes.

371
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,340
I don't like flour.

372
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,180
Rice cakes are made of rice.

373
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,660
It was nice to meet you too!

374
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Honey.

375
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Honey!

376
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,220
Yes?

377
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,180
Welcome back.

378
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,020
The doorbell rang,
so why didn't you open the door?

379
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,020
I was washing my hair.

380
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,980
But is the door lock broken?
Why'd you ring the doorbell?

381
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,700
I didn't ring it.

382
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,340
The person living downstairs came.

383
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,820
Seriously.

384
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,980
Not only is the house tiny,

385
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,140
but the security is also a mess.

386
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,820
Min-ji, wash your hands first.

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,140
If you come home, you have to
wash your hands for 20 seconds.

388
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,860
You're taking your medicine? Hold on.

389
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,380
Here's your water.

390
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
Here.

391
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,340
I got five complaints today.

392
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,020
They're only getting a few fillers,

393
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,700
so why are they asking for so much?

394
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,780
This is the very reason I didn't want
to open a dermatology franchise.

395
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,900
You took on something annoying
because of me.

397
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,020
I'll whip up your favorite

398
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,580
ice-cold tangerine highball.

399
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,180
My gosh, your legs are so stiff.

400
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,860
I'll loosen it up for you today.

401
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,300
Stop it.

402
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,460
But first, a cup of tangerine highball?

403
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,700
Ma'am.

404
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,660
Why are you being so kind today?

405
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,700
(Reusable Garbage Disposal Bag)

406
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,900
Let's see.

407
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,900
(Collect the coupons!)

408
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,500
Let's collect 20 coupons
and get a small tangsuyuk for free.

409
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
Sure.

410
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Right.

411
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,860
This.

412
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,380
What is it?

413
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,580
A contract stating
we'll jointly own the house

414
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,500
once it switches
to general sales after ten years.

415
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,060
It's 60 to 40, but it's fine right?
I did earn more points.

416
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,540
Of course. You even saved my life.

417
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,060
-Right?
-Yes.

418
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,140
I wanted the floor
to have a herringbone design.

419
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,700
But ripping the new floor apart
doesn't sit right.

420
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,860
This is neat too.

421
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,020
I can't believe it.

422
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,420
My house!

423
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,500
As for the curtains,
something natural like white

424
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,420
or beige sounds nice, doesn't it?

425
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,820
-Yes.
-Should we put up blinds on the balcony?

426
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,020
I think the lighting is perfect.

427
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,340
But how about we buy
some lights for decoration?

428
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,780
Let's buy some exercise equipment
for this room.

429
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,820
Good idea.

430
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,620
I prefer stainless steel
for the countertop.

431
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,100
But this is completely new too.

432
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,860
Let's use this for now
and change it later.

433
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,060
How about we change the faucet
of the sink and the bathroom?

434
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Sure.

435
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,260
I've got to earn lots.

436
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,260
But still, it's nice, isn't it?
It'll be worth earning money.

437
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,420
You're right. I'll earn lots too.

438
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
We can do it!

439
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,900
I heard someone
from the district office might visit.

440
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,460
Should I move it?

441
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,060
No, good job.

442
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,300
We need to be careful until the very end.

443
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
You're right.

444
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,340
My family had a house when I was young.

445
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,660
I don't know what went wrong,

446
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,820
but we kept moving into smaller houses,

447
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,980
and in the end,
we moved into a semi-basement house.

448
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,500
It only had one room.

449
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,460
Back in high school?

450
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
Yes.

451
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
During the day,
I could roam around outside,

452
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,100
but I still have to sleep at night.

453
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,300
So I'd go home as late as I could
and when I did,

454
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,260
my family

455
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,420
would sleep side-by-side
in that tiny room.

456
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,620
Mom and dad fought every single day.

457
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,260
When I couldn't put up with it any longer,

458
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,420
I'd leave the house with my dad's car key.

459
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,300
(I can't believe it!)

460
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,620
(You only get paid peanuts,)

461
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,220
(so how do you expect us to live on now?)

462
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,940
(Can't you see how hard
I'm trying to save up money?)

463
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,460
(Facility construction)

464
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,140
I wanted my own space.

465
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,900
My very own space.

466
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,460
I almost have it now.

467
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,500
The world had better not collapse now.

468
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,220
Good night.

469
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,620
You will end up like this too.

470
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,420
What's wrong?

471
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,660
What are they doing
in the middle of the night?

472
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,020
Do you want me to go upstairs?

473
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,660
No, it's okay.

474
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,020
I was just startled. That's all.

475
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,820
Hello?

476
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,100
(No Notifications)

477
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,220
Right now?

478
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,980
-Who was that?
-What?

479
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,220
Just a guy I know. He called
because of a case we're investigating.

480
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,220
Go back to sleep. You're on holiday.

481
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,140
Why must you draw Sae-bom's blood?
She's already exhausted.

482
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,860
We don't take much.

483
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm the one who got you married,
so don't be rude to me.

484
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,900
(We welcome all new residents.)

485
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,900
What does that have to do with you?
I made it happen on my own.

486
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Had I not gotten her the extra points,

487
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,980
she would've never asked you to marry her.

488
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,860
Anyway, you managed to sneak
into our building.

489
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,420
Did you see the news
about the homeless shelter?

490
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,620
-I did.
-Later in the day,

491
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,660
a report will be released
that people there were given Next.

492
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,220
In case there are any side effects,

493
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,380
the product will be completely
taken off the market,

494
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,740
and anyone who's caught selling them
will be punished severely.

495
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,100
That is the government's plan.

496
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,860
And why are you telling me all this?

497
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,060
Because we have to

498
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,620
work on this together.

499
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,060
We've sent an official request
for a joint investigation.

500
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm a busy man.

501
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,220
As you see, I'm...

502
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,220
(Captain)

503
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
Hello, sir.

504
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,220
Yes.

505
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Do I have to do it?

506
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,460
Sure, okay.
Who else would do it, if not me?

507
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Got it.

508
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,020
So?

509
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,980
What should I do first?

510
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,700
It's Lee Jong-tae's phone.

511
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,300
We've unlocked it.

512
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,500
We need you to meet and arrest the dealer
pretending to be him.

513
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,740
So Lee Jong-tae is working with us too?

514
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,260
Something like that.

515
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,020
Do you know

516
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,700
why drug-related cases are so tough?

517
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,340
These jerks never trust anyone,

518
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,170
and they're awfully greedy on top of that.

519
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,500
They won't agree to meet
unless we pay at least half up front.

520
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,260
But the police don't have the money
to do that.

521
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,220
It's not that I don't want to help.

522
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,900
The investigation won't go anywhere...

523
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,900
Use this for the investigation.

524
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,540
Bring back receipts if possible,

525
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,940
and return the rest.

526
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,980
I heard you used to work
at a pharmaceutical company.

527
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,090
In a team called "Competitive" something.

528
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,780
Competitive Advantage.

529
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,460
It's a department that steals
rival companies' products.

530
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,170
I couldn't make anything,

531
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
but I had a knack for stealing.

532
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,540
And for beating people up.

533
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,980
Call me when you have the dealer.

534
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,860
I should be there as an observer.

535
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,500
How much is this, exactly?

536
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,740
You'd better not lie
about the amount later on.

537
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,820
Senior Officer Jung Yi-hyun.

538
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,380
Your nickname is Sherlock

539
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,980
because you always use logic
to solve cases.

540
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,740
My colleagues say I'm reckless and lazy,
but also lucky.

541
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,700
I get bizarre ideas,

542
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,420
but they always work,
for some strange reason.

543
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,100
People assume that athletes are dumb.

544
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,980
Why don't you take this

545
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,220
as an opportunity to prove
that you are smart and athletic?

546
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,020
I really can't stand that guy.

547
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,740

548
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,220
(Ms. Kim Bok-nam)

549
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,740
Hi, Mom. What's up?

550
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,580
(I heard you moved
into the apartment yesterday.)

551
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,220
I can't believe you didn't even call me.

552
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,980
My goodness.

553
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,580
Must I hear about you through Yi-hyun?

554
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm exhausted now, Mom.

555
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,540
I was tested for an infectious disease.

556
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,420
(I got the Covid-19 test
more than five times.)

557
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,620
No, not that.

558
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,900
You know, the biting disease
that everyone's talking about these days.

559
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,460
The mad person disease?

560
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,900
It has a name?

561
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,820
Yes, the name came from "mad dog disease,"
also known as rabies.

562
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,300
They say people can get rabies too.

563
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,860
(My goodness.)

564
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,780
(That's why dog owners are
so stressed out these days.)

565
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,260
Yes. That thing.

566
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,340
I'm in quarantine now, after being tested
for the "mad person disease."

567
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,220
I bit someone in my dream last night.

568
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,580
Really?

569
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,860
What does Yi-hyun say?
Is he okay being around you?

570
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,260
Yes, of course.

571
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,220
We love each other so much, you know.

572
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,260
I'll get well soon and call you

573
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,460
as soon as we have the date
for our wedding.

574
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,740
I can't stop coughing. I have to go.

575
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,820
We need groceries.

(Hours of Operation)

578

(Weekdays: 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Weekends: 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.)

579
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
-Hi.
-Hello.

580
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,700
What is that? A duel request?

581
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Let me see that.

582
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,300
(Thank you for the rice cakes)

583
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
(Thank you for the rice cakes)
Oh my gosh.

584
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,380
(Thank you for the rice cakes)

585
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,460
(Thank you for the rice cakes)
How pretty.

586
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:00,780
(Thank you for the rice cakes)

587
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,340
Thanks.

588
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,900
They deliver, you know.

589
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,780
Yes, I saw.

590
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,060
Ask your family to order from them

591
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,980
if you want rice cakes later.

592
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,740
Anyway, are you really a cop?

593
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,700
Yes, of course.

594
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,220
See?

595
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,220
It's better than a cop.

596
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,900
I want to become like you
if I become healthy.

597
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,220
Are you sick?

598
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
A little.

599
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,780
I was really sick a long time ago

600
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,500
and missed school for two years.

601
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,780
-Really?
-Yes.

602
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,500
But I'm healthy now.

603
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,700
You'll become stronger than I am,

604
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,420
so don't worry at all. I mean it.

605
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Thanks.

606
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,100
Where are you going?

607
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
To duel.

608
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,260
May I help you?

609
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,780
I live downstairs.
You were loud all night long.

610
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,620
Are you renovating?

611
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm sorry.
I was moving some furniture around.

612
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,820
In the middle of the night?

613
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,620
I tend to spring to action
once I get an idea.

614
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,580
I always have to do it right away.

615
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
Sorry about that.

616
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,700
That's an illness, actually.

617
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,860
It won't happen again.

618
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,740
I'd appreciate it.

619
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,500
Thanks for the rice cake.

620
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,980
How did you know it was from me?

621
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,700
-I don't think we've met.
-I heard.

622
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,100
She's pretty. She takes after you.

623
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,580
You're pretty.

624
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,660
Haven't you seen him before?

625
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,100
I've seen him a few times in the elevator,

626
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,180
but he doesn't seem to care
about other people.

627
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,500
Both he and his wife are doctors

628
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,380
but he bums around at home.

629
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,340
My mom says he has a legal problem.

630
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,220
I see. Or he may just like bumming around.

631
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,580
-Bye.
-What about you?

632
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,620
Me? I want to work out.

633
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,180
Have a nice day.

634
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,060
Are you home alone?

635
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,980
My dad makes deliveries.

636
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,780
My mom helps him sort
through the items in the morning.

637
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,620
What about school?

638
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,540
I'm doing online learning at home.

639
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,460
If you tell them in advance,

640
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,820
you can skip 19 days of school every year.

641
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,460
I see.

642
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Come with me.

643
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,580
Today, you'll have gym class.

644

Hi there.

659
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,500
Hello.

660
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,900
Are you going to exercise too?

661
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Yes.

662
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,180
-Here.
-Okay. Thank you.

663
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,420
(Yoon Sae-bom, Building 101, Unit 501)

664
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,420
So...

665
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,140
Public housing residents
don't have access.

666
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,220
Why not? Because of maintenance fees?

667
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,540
Yes, that too, but...

668
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,620
Because of the price of the equipment.

669
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,740
Some people say it's unfair
to let public housing residents use them

670
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,780
when the residents of the regular units
are the ones who paid for them.

671
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,180
I see. Fine. I'll work out at home then.

672
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,420
-Let's go.
-Wait. Excuse me.

673
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,620
But if you get personal training from me,

674
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,900
I can waive that requirement for you.

675
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
I'll work out at home.

676
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,980
Did you know?

677
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,060
Yes.

678
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,460
(We welcome all new residents.)

679
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,660
Then why didn't you tell me?

680
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,020
(We welcome all new residents.)

681
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,100
Because I thought you could fix it.

682
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,780
Isn't there another fire code
or something?

683
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,260
It's difficult when money's involved.

684
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,700
(Le Ciel)
It's difficult when money's involved.

685
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,540
(Le Ciel)

686
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,860
(Le Ciel)
There is a way though.

687
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,100
(Le Ciel)

688
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,940
-One.
-One.

689
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,340
-Two.
-Two.

690
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,260
-Three.
-Three.

691
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,100
Slowly. Four.

692
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,300
Four.

693
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,220
Good. Five.

694
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,340
Five.

695
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,580
Let's move on.

696
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,420
What do they do at school
during gym class?

697
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,980
-Running.
-Do you run well?

698
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,060
No.

699
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,140
I'm really good.

700
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,660
(Wife)

701
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,700
(Missed Call: Wife)

702
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,740
Get lots of rest since you exercised.

703
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,140
Bye.

704
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,420
She's so cute.

705
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,620
-Hey.
(-Sae-bom.)

706
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,900
(Help me.)

707
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,900
(I was)

708
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,020
scratched by that trainee that day.

709
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,420
I was too scared to tell you,

710
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,340
but the wound won't heal.

711
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,100
Where are you?

712
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,020
I'll come to you.

713
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,700
It's okay.

714
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,580
Look at me. I'm fine.

715
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,420
Get tested today

716
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,260
and rest up. You'll be fine.

717
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,820
I'll tell your wife
you're not having an affair.

718
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,580
The thought of dying scares me.

719
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,260
Why would you die?

720
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,980
You weren't bit.

721
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,620
Look at me.

722
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,980
It's nothing.

723
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,660
Get tested today and confirm
that you're fine. Then it'll all be good.

724
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,660
I'll ask them to give you extra points.

725
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,460
You're not thirsty or anything, right?

726
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,700
(Stop)

727
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,700
I'm bringing in a patient.

728
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,180
Let me look at the wound.

729
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,180
Are you sure this is a scratch?

730
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,500
It looks like a knife wound.

731
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,300
It looks fresh too.

732
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,900
I wish it were as well.

733
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,940
You know my wound won't heal either.

734
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,180
It doesn't look too serious.

735
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,580
But let's run a test.

736
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,020
There we go.

737
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,580
What will be different
if there's a problem?

738
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,740
The color.

739
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,660
The wound will turn dark red.

740
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,100
Wait here until the results are out.

741
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,620
Aren't you going to uncuff me?

742
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,140
This should be enough for you to move.

743
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,020
Tell me if you get thirsty.

744
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,700
Ms. Yoon, step out for a minute.

745
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,740
I told you, didn't I?

746
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,540
You'll be fine.

747
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,860
I'll be back after I get my blood drawn.

748
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,100
It's okay.

749
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,260
Nothing will happen.

750
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,260
I'm just making money.

751
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,180
It's okay.

752
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,820
Tell me in advance
if something like this happens again.

753
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,260
I don't want to be surprised.

754
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,020
I will,

755
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,580
so can you open my bag?

756
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,060
I'm killing you with kindness.

757
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,600
Our trainee,

758
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,040
the one who was bitten by Lee Jong-tae.

759
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,800
I heard he's in bad condition

760
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,160
and that his family visit was rejected.

761
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,320
If you get bitten,
you'll get infected no matter what.

762
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,920
Your condition gets worse

763
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,600
and your time
as a normal person decreases.

764
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,880
You never know
when you'll get thirsty and attack others.

765
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,720
So it's only natural
that visits are restricted.

766
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,600
Is there a way to treat it?

767
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,120
None at the moment.

768
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,640
If it gets worse,
you'll always feel thirsty.

769
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,520
You lose reason and attack anyone you see.

770
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,000
The only thing we can do right now

771
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,360
is to slow down that process.

772
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,920
So it's true nobody made it out alive.

773
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,480
Ms. Yoon,

774
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,720
you're very lucky.

775
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,000
If everything is all right,
it'll be the same for Mr. Lee.

776
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,680
You're bored, right?
How about we grab some food?

777
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,000
Where are you right now?

778
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,920
I have a family.

779
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,040
I'll die in vain
and they'll keep it a secret.

(Sae-bom.)

781
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,000
There's a way I can ensure safety
and make money.

782
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,560
Hello? Hey, Lee Seung-young!

783
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,480
(The person you have reached
is not available.)

784
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,080
(Will they be okay?)

785
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,160
What if they all die in there?

786
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,040
I got a call from a reporter.

787
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,280
He said he'd pay me if I told him

788
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,640
(what happened here.)

789
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,460
He slipped out wearing
a quarantine uniform.

790
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,900
They thought he was hauling chairs.

791
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,660
Where are the critically ill patients?

792
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,780
Where are they?

793
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,140
They were isolated in an underground
low-temperature food ingredient warehouse.

794
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,260
But the number kept increasing.
We had no choice but to move them.

795
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,900
To where?

796
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,820
The refrigerator truck.

797
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,620
Darn it.

798
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,140

and other incentives for high ratings.)

800
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,420
Wire me the money first.

801
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,620
Then I'll send the video right away.

802
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,060
This conversation is being recorded,

803
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,220
so don't think you can dupe me later.

804
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,780
Then send me at least half!

805
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,180
Call me after you send me the money.

806
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,940
This is

807
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,500
a huge scoop.

(Seyang Dream Car Wash)

809
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,220
Why not go in if he's in there?

810
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,540
I'm waiting for someone.

811
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,540
Who? Did you call for backup?

812
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,260
Speak of the devil.

813
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,820
What? My goodness.

814
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,140
Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok.

815
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,860
What brings you here?

816
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,940
The dealer.

817
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,940
Senior Officer Jung
and I will go meet him. Do you mind?

818
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,180
No, not at all. I'll just wait here.

819
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,860
-Hey--
-I know.

820
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,180
Stand guard.

821
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,900
I really can't stand him.

822
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,300
Why are you really here?

823

Next's manufacturer had the rest
of the supply stored in their warehouse.

00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,700
I want to find out who released it.

825
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,540
I saw the news. It looks like this disease
has spread to other countries.

826
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,380
Was Next sold worldwide?

827
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,900
I told you I had a knack for stealing

828
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,580
although I was never good
at making things.

829
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,900
I stole it for a foreign company.

830
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,660
Back in my Competitive Advantage days.

831
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,780
He's really something.

832
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,580
There are three of them.

833
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,780
Hey, turn off the lights!

834
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,860
(Exit)

835
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,100
(Exit)
Did you bring the rest?

836
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:11,140
(Exit)

837
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,500
Where is Lee Jong-tae?

838
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,060
Well...

839
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,460
Jong-tae, that punk.

840
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,300
I can't reach him.

841
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,420
I only see these two.

842
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:37,820
There are three.

843
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,060
(Slow Down, Slippery)

844
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,940
The pills.

845
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,180
In the trunk.

846
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,020
Go ahead and cuff them.

847
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,260
You jerks are dead meat now.

848
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,300
What's that?

849
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,220
A Glock. First time seeing one?

850
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,660
Why do you even have that on you?

851
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,980
(Exit)

852
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,860
What are you doing?

853
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,580
Just making sure he's dead.

854
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,460
How could you kill a person
in front of a cop?

855
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,980
Does this look like a human to you?

856
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,300
Hands up!

857
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,140
Hands up.

858
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,540
It's over.

859
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,780
Really? My goodness.

860
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,620
Hey! How many shots did you fire?

861
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,820
Thank goodness they were blanks.
You could be reprimanded for this.

862
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,020
Did you do this?

863
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,220
Stop!

864
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,980
Please.

865
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,940
Wait! Stop!

866
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,220
When did he turn into that?

867
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,620
I don't know!

868
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,860
When I went to his place to get paid,

869
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,420
he was already like that.
He had bitten his family to death.

870
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,860
He was banging his head
on the bloody floor.

871
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,140
Did he take Next?

872
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,500
Yes, lots of it.

873
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,780
He totally lost his mind
and ended up like that.

874
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,500
And you used him like that?

875
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,100
What else is he good for?

876
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,500
He's the best guard dog
that doesn't need to be fed.

877
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,300
You guys took the pills too, didn't you?

878
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,260
You'll end up like him soon.

879
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,700
-Get up, jerk.
-Yes.

880
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,180
Okay.

881
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,100
Mr. Jung.
There's a problem at the dormitory.

882
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,460
What about it?

883
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,660
Ms. Yoon is there now.

884
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,100
What is she doing there?

885
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,020
(They're not human.)

886
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,540
What's not human?

887
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,860
(All of them.)

888
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,540
Quiet!

889
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:44,540
Open this truck.

890
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,340
Hurry!

891
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,020
No, don't open it!

892
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:41,460
=Happiness=

893
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,700
(Be honest.)

894
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,020
You think they're monsters.

895
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,620
They want the case dropped.

896
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,620
(The mad person disease is spreading
in the apartment complex.)

897
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,180
(That pill causes
the mad person disease, doesn't it?)

898
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,620
Bad rumors will only bring down
our property prices.

899
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,260
(Block all of them in as planned.)

900
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,580
(Lock them up
and just wait for them to die?)

901
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,660
There was definitely something off
about the lady upstairs.

902
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,740
(What is happening)

903
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,900
(inside the apartment?)
