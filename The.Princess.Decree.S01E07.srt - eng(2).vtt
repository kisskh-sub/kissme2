Li Yuanze.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.159
You planned this from the start.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.920
I just want to know

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.480
when

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.159

So that's it.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:19.719
It was my oversight.

Five years apart,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.680

You've been writing all night.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.199
I'm fine.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.759
Empress Dowager helped us this time.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.120
Can it change our situation?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.480
She helped me

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.240
for the sake of our relationship.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.560
This is the first time

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.920
and likely the last.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.759
She's already old

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.279
and no longer
wishes to meddle in imperial court.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.839
We shouldn't trouble her again.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.120

Why can't I understand Master's intent?

Since we have the riddle,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.639
we can surely find its answer.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.480
As long as we can

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.879
purge the court before that,

is this name so familiar?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.480
Does this character

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.199
mean longing,

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.040

Or else

would you

have killed Li Yuanze?

What if I said yes?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.039
You wouldn't.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.039
Why not?

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.240
Because

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:21.120
I know my own granddaughter.

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:29.919
It has been five years.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.360
I'm no longer that carefree

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.960
and worry-free Princess Royal.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.879
Why wouldn't I change?

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.380
(Strategic Treatise)

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.679
Because of this.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:50.600
Every single page

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:51.919
of the emperor's scrolls

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.480
is covered with your annotations.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.879
Your dedication

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.559
would likely make Imperial Tutor
feel ashamed in comparison.

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:02.919
If you truly colluded with Gan Sheng,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.159
why waste such effort?

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:09.279
You entered the palace
under the pretext of ruling,

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:12.799
but it was clearly to guide the emperor

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.639
in learning the art of governance

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.799
and mold him into a wise ruler.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.919
Pingning.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.799
You've always been like this.

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:46.279
I have always known you.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.120
How could this kingdom

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:51.080
fall to anyone else?

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.200
You're wrong.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.879
I don't care

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.840
who rules.

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:06.480
From the beginning,

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:09.600
I acted only out of selfishness.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.639
I will never allow

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.399
my story to repeat again.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.279
I will prove to everyone

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.759
that sacrificing women

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:28.039
for the peace of the world

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.080
is wrong.

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:38.039
I failed to save you back then.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.240
Do you resent me?

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.600
Women of the palace

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.200
are like floating weeds.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.200
We cannot decide others' fates.

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.480
And often

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:00.320
not even decide our own.

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.639
So why harbor resentment?

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:04.759
Besides...

00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:06.720
Grandmother.

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:13.759
Did your illness

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.279
come from begging for me

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:18.639
back then?

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.639
If so,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.519
why pursue Li Yuanze so relentlessly?

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.159
No matter what,

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.039
I won't let him off easy.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.460
(Jing, Beijiang,
Nanjiang, Western Regions)

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:50.639
Within one year,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.399
I will make all of Jing mine.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.200
Within three years,

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:00.120
(Western Regions, Nanjiang)
I will make these lands

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.960
belong to Jing as well.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.159
You're far-sighted

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.279
and will surely succeed.

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:10.399
That's why all the kingdom's funds

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:12.840
must enter my pocket first.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.320
The army budget reform

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.960
must be carried out.

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:23.320
Why has Mr. Qingya not been found?

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:26.399
His whereabouts are unpredictable.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.240
It takes real effort to track him.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.759
But

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.639
I think

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.960
he's probably scared to appear

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.759
because he's a fraud

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:36.890
and afraid of being exposed.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.279
What do you know?

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.399
Back then,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.240
I lost a war.

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:48.120
The late Emperor sent me
to Lotus Pavilion to reflect.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.879
I almost lost my post.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.480
I never believed in gods,

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.240
yet that old monk
coincidentally helped me

00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:57.519
meet Mr. Qingya once.

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:01.159
(Beijiang Map)
Attacking Beijiang could solve this.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.399
Without him,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.039
how would I be here today?

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.840
Such a weapon must be mine.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:15.200
Whatever the cost is,

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:19.080
we must find him.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.440
Yes, General.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.039
But

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.200
before that,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.639
ever since Li Yuanze returned,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.960
the old farts of Ministry of Revenue
just stayed inside

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.900
and stalled on purpose,

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:31.519
refusing to raise army funds.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.000
What should we do?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.759
If they won't cooperate,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.720
find someone who will

00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:43.360
and put him in that post.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.519
But Li Yuanze will never agree.

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:47.360
Him?

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.879
Perfect.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.120
Someone

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.720
has to answer for his accounts.
