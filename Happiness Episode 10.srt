00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:57,075
Does Sae Bom have the antibodies?

19
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,174
Unfortunately, she does not.

20
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:03,914
Then why did you suddenly contact us?

21
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,384
Send Seo Yoon to us.
As a humanitarian act,

22
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,515
we decided to release all the underaged...

23
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,315
from the lockdown.

24
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:12,485
It must be dangerous outside as well.

25
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,584
We'll take them where the risk is minimum.

26
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:17,394
However, the problem is helping her
leave the complex safely.

27
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:20,364
Can I send Sae Bom out with her?

28
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:28,334
If those two are willing,
I will take them in.

29
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:31,634
But she must cooperate with my demands.

30
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,114
I'll talk to Sae Bom and get back to you.

31
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,855
Must you keep it from Mr. Jung too?

32
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:49,554
Don't you think something was off?

33
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:52,565
He said, "It must be dangerous outside",

34
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:55,465
then asked if he could send Ms. Yoon too.

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,435
If it were dangerous,
he would've volunteered himself.

=Episode 10=

37
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,775
What's that?

38
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:05,634
We found this in Seo Yoon's apartment.

39
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:07,944
I was a Jenga master in school.

40
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,104
I'm a Level Nine.

41
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,145
Do you want to play too?

42
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,444
No, I have to go to the 15th floor.

43
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:15,185
Maybe later, okay?

44
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:16,484
Sae Bom?

45
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,414
You just saw her.

46
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:21,754
The more I see her,
the more I want to see her.

47
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,395
I can't stand him.

48
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:30,234
Yi Hyun, something's wrong.

49
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:37,974
What is it?

50
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,185
Look. It was on the table.

51
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:51,155
I made a mistake I cannot fix.

52
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,354
I tried to stay at home...

53
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:55,555
and hold my ground
for as long as possible,

54
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,694
but I can't do this anymore.

55
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,525
I will leave the complex
and go outside to ask for help.

56
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,395
The leftover food and water,

57
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:07,034
you can share with the rest of the residents.

58
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:13,805
Here.

59
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:18,474
(Unit 1501, Kim Se Hoon)

60
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:21,345
It's different, isn't it?

61
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:22,754
Well,

62
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,014
when you feel anxious,

63
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:26,925
your handwriting does change.

64
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:31,854
We need a sleuth.

65
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:45,375
Do you believe him, though?

66
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,745
"I'll go outside and ask for help."

67
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,175
"Share the food."

68
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:51,615
It's weird.

69
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,245
What is the mistake...

70
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:57,354
you can't fix?

71
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,754
If you don't leave your home,

72
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:02,824
can you do any wrong?

73
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:05,594
You can.

74
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,425
The gym.

75
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:08,894
You're still on about that?

76
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,694
He's not the type to take that pill.

77
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,334
What's this?

78
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,404
(White Lime)

79
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,475
Does he grow stuff?

80
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,144
That eliminates the smell
if you put it in the urinal.

81
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,214
I'm with the SOU.

82
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:27,084
We did that for field training.

83
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:28,685
Right.

84
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,125
What happened to him?

85
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,495
There are a lot of medicines.

86
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:50,904
All these are safe for home use.

87
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:58,615
Next.

88
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:01,745
We're finally...

89
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:03,153
- Oh?
- My gosh.

90
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,055
What's going on?
You two were inside.

91
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,125
- Where's the guy?
- Why are you here?

92
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:09,425
We're here to continue
where we left off yesterday.

93
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,495
We're all suffering.

94
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:14,995
He gave you something.

95
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,735
- Oh, this is...
- We're in this together.

96
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,565
We should help each other out.

97
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,805
I am still negotiating with him.

98
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,634
Give him some time.

99
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:26,704
Gosh...

100
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,694
It's all still here.

101
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:45,324
There are no signs of an intrusion,

102
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:46,694
and we found Next pills.

103
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:50,535
The mistake he can't fix
might mean that he's infected.

104
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:54,134
I'm not so sure.

105
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,904
He took selfies and seemed so pleased.

106
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,675
Even if he were infected,
he'd just stay indoors.

107
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:06,214
There's no way
a homebody would've gone outside.

108
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,344
Then where is he?

109
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:11,615
Someone locked him up.

110
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,425
What about the note saying we're to share?

111
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,725
He was forced to write that note.

112
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:27,535
No?

113
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:48,384
He's not in the building,
and the door was open.

114
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:49,824
He could've actually gone out.

115
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,194
There are soldiers all around the complex.

116
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:55,024
He's rich.
Someone could've agreed to let him out.

117
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,964
Will you open the door?

118
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:02,435
Mister!

119
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,574
Why don't I hear anything?
Are you home?

120
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,105
What are you doing?

121
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,084
You're here too, Ms. Oh.

122
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:21,754
Everyone came to me to ask for help.

123
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,324
I heard there was a lot of water here.

124
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:27,625
Wouldn't it be nice to share?

125
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:29,295
Yes, it would.

126
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,665
We at least want to talk about it.

127
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:36,105
Someone saw him leave the building.

128
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,975
We also need to check if he's infected.

129
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:39,975
- Who saw him leave?
- I did.

130
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,214
I saw him leave from the first floor this morning.

131
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,415
Are you sure?

132
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,584
Are you sure it was Kim Se Hoon?

133
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:48,144
I didn't see his face.

134
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:51,285
But he's the only one
who wears the biohazard suit.

135
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,394
I'm sorry to say this,

136
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:03,764
but we do need a plan
because there's not enough water.

137
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:09,834
And the couple on the second floor
keeps offering ridiculous prices.

138
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,134
Come on.

139
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,255
So you had a key?

140
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:31,755
I saw her leave with a shopping bag earlier.

141
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,065
This is mine.

142
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:38,295
Gosh.

143
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:46,104
It says he wants us to divide his stuff in the house.

144
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:48,204
Then the house owner gave us his permission.

145
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,244
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

146
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,675
But more importantly...

147
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:54,244
What is this mistake he cannot undo now?

148
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,915
Did he have a legal problem?

149
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:00,155
So basically, it's finders keepers.

150
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:01,885
- Honey, take the water first.
- Yes?

151
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,354
Take it.

152
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:08,094
- Let go.
- Calm down.

153
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,535
We should only take some of the food for now.

154
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:11,964
We'll only take some, not all.

155
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:13,934
Mr. Kim might come back.

156
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,035
And we'll also share this with people
who are not here.

157
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:18,035
Who says you can do that?
Who do you think you are?

158
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,675
Fine. I got it.

159
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:23,045
Call everyone.

160
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:24,815
Detective, I need some help here.

161
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,045
Call everyone.

162
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,484
Call them. I got it.
Just get your hands off me.

163
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:36,655
That's so heavy.

164
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,324
It's nice to have some water now.

165
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,265
Let's put some candles in the bathroom too.

166
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:46,704
What's wrong?

167
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:49,905
Hey, this is all we got.

168
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:52,874
I saw a lot of survival equipment in his house.

169
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:57,214
But still. The fifth-floor detective was fair
in distributing the water.

170
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:58,714
Fair?

171
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:01,015
Hey, to make this really fair,

172
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,815
some of us ought to get more water.

173
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,314
We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars more
to buy our unit.

174
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:05,614
So we deserve more water!

175
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,255
Isn't that common sense?

176
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:09,895
- Think before you talk.
- Right.

177
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:11,755
Right.

178
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,065
By the way, that guy from the fifth floor...

179
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:16,295
looked a bit off today. Right?

180
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,395
He was glued to his wife.

181
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,665
I guess he loves her a lot.

182
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:27,645
You too.

183
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,915
- You love me a lot too, right?
- Hey.

184
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:31,574
It's hot. Don't get close.

185
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:35,185
There was a lot of food on the 15th floor, right?

186
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:38,114
Yes.

187
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,584
His unit was spacious.

188
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:41,425
And there was a lot of weird stuff too.

189
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:01,374
What are you looking at?

190
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:04,874
What brings you two here?

191
00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:06,145
It's about Unit 1501.

192
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:08,285
The house owner is gone.
Only his stuff is in his unit.

193
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,645
We can't just let it sit there.

194
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:11,353
The residents in our apartment...

195
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,015
are suffering due to the shortages
of daily necessities.

196
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:17,694
Hey, stay outside.

197
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:20,864
You want me to leave?

198
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:22,295
Then should I leave?

199
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,165
Go outside.

200
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,035
Hurry.

201
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,374
Come on in.

202
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:46,785
So Mr. Kim left the apartment, right?

203
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,624
Probably.

204
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:50,494
He's not inside the apartment.

205
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:52,425
He must have been lonely.

206
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:55,265
I saw on TV that some people
died alone in their house...

207
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,935
because they didn't have any friends or family.

208
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,765
That must be why he left.

209
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:04,474
My parents will be okay
because they are together, right?

210
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,545
Of course.

211
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:10,574
We would've been so lonely without you.

212
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,374
Look at your cute dimple.

213
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:22,255
Thanks.

214
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,094
Isn't it spicy?

215
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:31,535
You're a big girl
who can eat spicy things.

216
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,135
You're going to eat that much sauce?

217
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:39,604
- Isn't it spicy?
- No.

218
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:41,744
I think it might be spicy.

219
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:27,114
Jung Guk.

220
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,155
Jung Guk.

221
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:32,915
Yes? What is it?

222
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:37,395
I don't see Yi Hyun here.
When did he leave?

223
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:39,795
I don't know.

224
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,635
Hey, you too? You miss him
even when you see him all the time?

225
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:46,704
Go back to sleep.

226
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:49,834
I know that. I've been there too.

227
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:20,704
Shall we get married?

228
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,435
I wanted to change the floors
to a herringbone pattern,

229
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:25,805
but it doesn't feel right
to take apart new floors.

230
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:29,005
But this is nice and neat too.

231
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,214
I can't believe it.

232
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:33,175
Our own house.

233
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,515
I thought I was all alone.

234
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,224
Hey.

235
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,594
Where have you been?
You should be sleeping.

236
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:22,624
Well, you see...

237
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:24,435
Does the walkie-talkie work?

238
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,464
Let me see that.

239
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:30,334
Lieutenant Colonel Han.

240
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,474
Lieutenant Colonel Han.

241
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:41,214
- Hey, Han Tae Seok.
- He's probably asleep.

242
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:44,755
What did you talk about?

243
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:48,224
Do I have the antibodies?

244
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,195
No.

245
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:55,664
I knew it.

246
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,864
I've never even won fifth place
with lottery tickets.

247
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:03,535
But I'm lucky that I didn't get infected.

248
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,205
Hey.

249
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:10,674
Did the wound open up?

250
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,045
No. It's getting much better.

251
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,045
As if. If it gets infected,
this wound will get much worse.

252
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:16,184
Hey. I...

253
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,805
It looks like it has gotten a lot better.

254
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:44,844
I told you. I'm a human vitamin
and a human antibiotic.

255
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:47,015
Did you get hurt anywhere else?

256
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,114
You can tell me right now.

257
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,184
No, I'm fine.

258
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:51,555
Okay.

259
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,985
What did Han Tae Seok say?

260
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,495
He said to bring Seo Yoon out.

261
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,654
He said they'd accept her
on humanitarian grounds.

262
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:01,065
- Really?
- Yes.

263
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:02,364
So?

264
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:04,594
I told him I'd discuss it with you.

265
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:06,594
I see.

266
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:10,305
Isn't that dangerous?

267
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,535
So I was thinking...

268
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:15,074
What if you went out with her?

269
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:18,414
If she's with you,
Seo Yoon would feel safe too.

270
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,285
If we're going to go,
we should all go together.

271
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,245
You should go out
and get a shot of antibiotics too.

272
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,815
I don't think...

273
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,025
it would be good for Seo Yoon to leave now.

274
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,725
We need to know exactly
what's going on outside.

275
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:36,324
Oh, right.

276
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,604
Kim Se Hoon. Is he outside?

277
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:42,334
Not officially,

278
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,874
but someone might've snuck him out.
He said he'd look into it.

279
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,545
I thought about it,

280
00:19:50,674 --> 00:19:52,174
and he could still be in here.

281
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:55,245
We looked everywhere inside the apartment.

282
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:57,485
There's one place we didn't look.

283
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:03,624
He was planning on leaving,

284
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,995
but the soldiers and the infected scared him,

285
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,594
so he came back in.

286
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:09,995
He's hiding in here.

287
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,965
I doubt he knows the passcode.

288
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:15,565
We should still check.

289
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:35,384
Sae Bom.

290
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,555
(Kim Se Hoon, Unit 1501)

291
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:02,785
Was it good?

292
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,154
You're the best.

293
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:09,184
No, you're the best.

294
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:12,894
Hey.

295
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:14,894
That's enough. Come out.

296
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:29,805
You just need to keep that in mind.

297
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,174
I was just giving her some legal counsel.

298
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:33,574
Right.

299
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:38,354
Don't do it in places
where there aren't any people.

300
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,154
You know, legal counsel.

301
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:43,525
If you sneak around,
you might bump into an infected person.

302
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:45,455
Will you keep our secret?

303
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,065
You should tell your wife first, Mr. Kook.

304
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:52,164
Once the trust is broken between a married couple,
it won't last long.

305
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:56,235
Can we leave now?

306
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,604
You two.

307
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,644
Don't come here ever again.

308
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:08,144
Hold on. Take this with you.

309
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:13,285
This isn't ours.

310
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:35,604
Kim Se Hoon?

311
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,184
Kim Se Hoon?

312
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,055
Do you hear me?

313
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:55,924
Are you doing this...

314
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:58,035
because of your thirst?

315
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,074
- This powder...
- It's lime.

316
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,344
The one that was in Kim Se Hoon's home.

317
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:11,035
Oh Ju Hyung. Are you really a doctor?

318
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:15,275
Can you come out?
There's someone I need you to look at.

319
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,245
My license has been suspended.

320
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:22,914
Who is it? Who's sick?

321
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:26,884
You'll find out if you follow me.

322
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:30,084
We really have no idea. We just...

323
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:32,955
I was just giving her legal counsel.

324
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,924
You don't need to tell me about that anymore.

325
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,565
Just tell me the circumstances of
when you came in here.

326
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,834
Did you sense anything strange
when you came in?

327
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:44,104
Well... I don't really remember.

328
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:46,205
You didn't go into the main bedroom?

329
00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:22,674
No. We went in. We did, but...

330
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:25,914
How should I put it?
It smelled like cement,

331
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:28,545
and there were flies flying around.
So we left right away.

332
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:32,154
If we knew there was a body here,
we never would've come.

333
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:35,055
Do you think that we're murderers?

334
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:36,324
I'm an attorney.

335
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:39,354
Please recognize that I'm not that stupid.

336
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,164
What about Jung Guk?

337
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,495
I told him the situation.
He'll bring the others.

338
00:25:48,404 --> 00:25:50,035
What are you doing here?

339
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:52,674
Over here.

340
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:54,545
Please wait here.

341
00:26:05,654 --> 00:26:06,654
Oh, my.

342

(Seyang Forest Le Ciel Apartment)

344
00:26:15,164 --> 00:26:16,424
What are you looking at?

345
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,965
I feel a bit better when I look at this.

346
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,275
I can't become a dad they're ashamed of.

347
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:33,844
Gosh. I only took a quick glimpse,
but it used up so much battery.

348
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:43,384
- Here.
- But if you want to write,

349
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:45,424
don't you need it?

350
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,364
I can use a pen and paper.

351
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,894
That's the beauty of being a writer.

352
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,634
It doesn't cost money.

353
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:54,765
Thank you.

354
00:26:57,634 --> 00:27:00,275
I'm always getting things from you.

355
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:04,445
As your older brother,
I don't know what to say.

356
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:07,985
Hyun Kyung, even still...

357
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:11,084
If something happens to me,

358
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:15,324
can you take care of my family for me?

359
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:17,995
I can't do that.

360
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:21,324
Just focus on staying healthy
and getting out of here.

361
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:24,364
Hey. I'm sick.

362
00:27:24,465 --> 00:27:26,295
I'm asking you for this favour.
Can't you...

363
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:29,265
You must feel a lot better now.

364
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:34,674
Hello.

365
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,874
Yes, hello.

366
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:40,215
You gave me food last time.

367
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:41,914
I'm returning the favour.

368
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,315
I see.

369
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:48,285
What is this?

370
00:27:50,654 --> 00:27:51,654
What?

371
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,265
Is it okay for you to give me all of this?

372
00:27:57,934 --> 00:28:00,364
Of course. This is all mine.

373
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:04,975
I see you guys were here.

374
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:10,374
You guys have to follow me to the 11th floor.

375
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:11,945
Why? What's wrong?

376
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,715
Well...

377
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:16,445
Someone died.

378
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,455
What? Who?

379
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:26,594
What are you doing first thing in the morning?

380
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,295
I was so shocked. How annoying.

381
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:31,735
You're the only doctor in the apartment.

382
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:34,364
Then you should've told me what was wrong.

383
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,505
Hold on. What is this?

384
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:39,104
You suspected me?

385
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:40,775
You thought I killed her,

386
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:43,045
so you just pushed me in there?

387
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:44,745
I guess you didn't kill her.

388
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:46,545
You're such a great liar.

389
00:28:46,614 --> 00:28:48,084
Do you take me for a murderer?

390
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,245
Whatever.

391
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,854
As a doctor,

392
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:53,184
what is your opinion?

393
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:55,285
She died of a bite.

394
00:28:56,154 --> 00:28:57,654
Her neck was ripped out.

395
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:58,795
I stink.

396
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,025
Don't you have a more expert opinion?

397
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:04,394
An expert opinion?

398
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:07,864
Based on the coagulated blood
and lividity of the corpse,

399
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:09,735
she has been dead for over two days.

400
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,874
Lime powder was used to eliminate the smell.

401
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,144
It's the same powder...

402
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:16,174
we saw in Unit 1501, right?

403
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:19,114
Darn fruit flies.

404
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:22,985
They're the first to arrive
when there's a dead body.

405
00:29:23,045 --> 00:29:25,715
To lay eggs in the eye and nose cavities.

406
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:29,055
That's why they say
even if you have to roll around in the muck,

407
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:30,654
it's better to be alive than dead.

408
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,824
Go outside and tell the others.

409
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:34,465
Don't mention the fruit flies.

410
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:37,164
What a scare.

411
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:38,695
Darn it.

412
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:39,934
So,

413
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:43,805
were these two the first to find the body?

414
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,104
At the same time?

415
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,104
- You're mistaken.
- Well,

416
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:49,104
I had a weird feeling,

417
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:50,475
so I suggested we check it out.

418
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,815
I dreamed of the cleaning lady
crying her eyes out.

419
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:56,215
It's true.

420
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:57,884
Of course it's true.

421
00:29:58,154 --> 00:29:59,154
Don't.

422
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,354
It's fine.

423
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:03,525
It's fine by me,

424
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,195
but I'm worried about you, Mr. Kook.

425
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,924
Your wife will have the most horrific shock.

426
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,265
Won't she?

427
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:13,535
That punk stabbed us in the back.

428
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,235
Oh. Detective.

429
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:19,674
Andrew ran off with all our food.

430
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,104
Can't you catch him in the act?

431
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:23,245
Shouldn't you arrest him right away?

432
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,445
Calm down.

433
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:26,475
A resident died.

434
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:28,715
That's not important right now.

435
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,285
Our food is gone.

436
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:33,114
The cleaning lady
who stayed with you is dead.

437
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:34,725
Lee Deok Soon.

438
00:30:35,654 --> 00:30:37,924
- What...
- Seriously.

439
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:39,824
- Oh, dear.
- So...

440
00:30:39,894 --> 00:30:41,495
I took a look at the body.

441
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,364
I think an infected person killed her.

442
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,765
Her neck had been bitten and chewed out.

443
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:50,364
It must be the guy from the 15th floor.

444
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:51,874
He'd written on the note that...

445
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:54,374
he'd made a mistake he couldn't fix.

446
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:58,045
You're right.

447
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,114
That was his confession.

448
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:02,445
Then the leftover food in his apartment...

449
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:03,815
can be shared, right?

450
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:06,914
There's nothing yet to prove
it was Mr. Kim's doing.

451
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:09,285
Who else would it be?

452
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:12,424
There are no other infected people in the building.

453
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,424
From what I see,

454
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,525
we have a victim and someone on the run.

455
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,235
That's a natural cause to suspect.

456
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,965
Mr. Jung's a detective and must know that much.

457
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:26,174
It needs more looking into.

458
00:31:27,104 --> 00:31:30,005
Especially on how the victim
left the second floor and ended up here.

459
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:34,945
I'll get your witness statements later.

460

Honey.

461
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,525
It was really scary.

462
00:31:51,394 --> 00:31:53,265
Unit 1102 is a crime scene.

463
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:54,765
Don't enter the unit for a while.

464
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:57,134
We changed the code to the door.

465
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,074
When will you hand out the 15th-floor supplies?

466
00:31:59,404 --> 00:32:01,505
Andrew took our food and ran!

467
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:02,705
Stop it.

468
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:04,144
Sae Bom, Yi Hyun.

469
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:06,644
I got Guk Jin and the writer.

470
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:08,614
It's so far up.

471
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:09,745
What happened?

472
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,215
Is the cleaning lady really dead?

473
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:13,854
You dirty thief.

474
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:15,485
How dare you?

475
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,124
- Get back up!
- Stop it.

476
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:20,094
Honey. You might kill him.

477
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,565
Why would you punch him like that?

478
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:23,660
- Darn it.
- Are you all right?

Young In.

483
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:43,175
Her breakout won't stop.

484
00:32:44,185 --> 00:32:45,285
The sedative.

485
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:46,745
We gave her the maximum dose.

486
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:48,255
Her body can't take any more.

487
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:52,755
We have leftover samples of Sae Bom's plasma cure.

488
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,854
Just one and our superiors want it.

489
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:57,925
They want a sample of everything
we're running trials on.

490
00:32:58,794 --> 00:32:59,925
Sir!

491
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,705
You said you'd keep Ms. Yoon in the dark.

492
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:10,775
If you use this sample,

493
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:12,775
our superiors will realize it's important.

494
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:14,015
I know that.

495
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:33,265
Put it down.

496
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:40,935
Drop your gun.

497
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:44,144

00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:56,855
We're all on the same side.

500
00:33:57,685 --> 00:33:59,554
Lieutenant Colonel Han is in charge here.

501
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:02,754
Ask the prime minister.

502
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,924
He's doing what needs to be done.

503
00:34:19,344 --> 00:34:20,504
Get out of the way.

504
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:34,214
Check her condition...

505
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:35,515
and call immediately
if there's a problem.

506
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:38,024
What just happened.

507
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:41,594
Our superiors will find out.

508
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:45,824
And the fact that you didn't tell Ms. Yoon.

509
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,225
Not if we report it first.

510
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:50,395
- What?
- Tell our superiors...

511
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:51,665
that Ms. Yoon developed antibodies.

512
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,134
And that we tested it on my wife...

513
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:55,074
and confirmed it's effective.

514
00:35:55,134 --> 00:35:56,205
Then...

515
00:35:56,274 --> 00:35:58,145
Say we'll get Ms. Yoon tomorrow.

516
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:00,745
You're only buying some time.

517
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:02,875
They'll begin to suspect you.

518
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:05,515
That's what I need.

519
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:08,185
Time.

520
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:14,694
Andrew's the last witness.

521
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:16,054
No one saw her after that.

522
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,964
Her estimated time of death
is around that time too?

523
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:24,065
It means she was attacked on her way upstairs.

524
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:26,335
Do you...

525
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:28,134
really think it was Mr. Kim?

526
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,174
Sae Bom, can I have some water?

527
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:35,415
I'm dying.

528
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,545
Gosh.

529
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:39,085
I'm drained.

530
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:41,455
I'm getting such a workout.

531
00:36:42,654 --> 00:36:43,785
I'm so thirsty.

532
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:50,795
Thanks.

533
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:00,435
How are the others?

534
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:01,704
They're making a fuss.

535
00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:02,934
They're wondering
why we aren't doing anything...

536
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:04,545
when we know it was Kim Se Hoon,

537
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,374
and that we should go and break into his unit...

538
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,875
and share his stuff.

539
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,114
Let's go. They'll just get more agitated
if we let them.

540
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:19,024
I just got back...

541
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:30,835
We're only here for the food.

542
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:32,535
Don't take anything else.

543
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:34,134
And just in case,

544
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,875
we'll leave some food behind.

545
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:38,774
We'll divide them equally.
You can take turns coming in.

546
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:41,074
Come on in.

547
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:43,274
I wonder if he has any potatoes.

548
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:46,145
Everyone gets an equal share.

549
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:47,754
Then shouldn't we get Andrew's share too?

550
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:49,484
We can just take his share of the stuff.

551
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:52,225
Since we all get the same share,
we can take Andrew's, right?

552
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:53,824
Of course, we can.

553
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:57,594
By the way, shouldn't they give us Andrew's share?

554
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,795
Why won't they?

555
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:00,725
He took all of our food, you know?

556
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:03,234
- I won't let this slide. Watch me.
- Gosh.

557
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:07,105
How could he have taken
all of our food like that?

558
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:52,915
Is Dong Hyun here?

559
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:56,085
What? Well,

560
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:59,225
he was here. But he left.

561
00:39:00,824 --> 00:39:04,524
I carried all of this heavy stuff by myself.
Goodness.

562
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,364
So Yoon.

563
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,835
About what happened with that woman...

564
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:15,634
I was just giving her a consult
in a quiet place.

565
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:18,705
Stop it.

566
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:21,545
I cannot listen to your lies anymore.

567
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:32,054
Are you sure I can stay here?

568
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,424
Just for the time being.

569
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,194
Don't wander around the building.

570
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,355
The guy from the second floor
is out to get you.

571
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:40,193
I don't think he'll come up to the 15th floor.

572
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:41,435
It's quite the trip from there.

573
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:46,304
Thank you. I'll only stay
until Mr. Kim comes back.

574
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:48,035
If he comes back.

575
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,234
Get some rest.

576
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:53,745
And when you're alone, take off your goggles.

577
00:39:53,804 --> 00:39:55,214
It must be so stuffy.

578
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,884
Try not to leave the house.

579
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:55,674
Seo Yoon.

580
00:40:56,274 --> 00:40:58,975
Seo Yoon. What's wrong, Seo Yoon?

581
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:01,274
Seo Yoon. Does your chest hurt?

582
00:41:03,915 --> 00:41:04,915
What's wrong?

583
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:11,225
I just had to cough a bit.

584
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:15,024
This helps with the coughs.

585
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:20,464
But why did you hide
under the blanket to cough?

586
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:22,634
Do you have any medicine?

587
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:29,074
I get a shot when I go to the hospital.

588
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,004
But it hurts a lot.

589
00:41:34,174 --> 00:41:36,515
I just have to cough a bit.
Then I feel better.

590
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:43,884
Goodness.

591
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,594
We should send out Seo Yoon, right?

592
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:57,464
I know it's dangerous out there,
but there are doctors and medicine.

593
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,004
I'll talk to Han Tae Seok.

594
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,004
Don't worry too much.

595
00:42:20,085 --> 00:42:25,065
I'm sure my husband wants me
to do something for the apartment.

596
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,304
He was worried about you
until his last moment.

597
00:42:32,665 --> 00:42:33,835
You know that an infected person...

598
00:42:35,734 --> 00:42:38,304
killed the cleaning lady. Right?

599
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:43,344
The killer might still be in the building.
So be careful.

600
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:46,614
If possible, try not to leave your house.

601
00:42:46,685 --> 00:42:47,884
And if you can,

602
00:42:48,254 --> 00:42:50,484
pairing up when going out will be helpful.

603
00:42:50,554 --> 00:42:53,154
From now on, we ought to discuss
how to secure the main entrance...

604
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:56,194
and distinguish the infected people 
from the healthy residents.

605
00:42:57,895 --> 00:42:59,094
If we knew...

606
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:02,535
that my husband was infected sooner...

607
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,035
More importantly,

608
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:11,605
we must pro-actively find infected people
among the residents.

609
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,145
We must do our best to convince...

610
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:17,214
even those residents
who won't leave their houses to check.

611
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,015
I see.

612
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:22,054
We should check
if any other people are infected.

613
00:43:22,984 --> 00:43:26,054
Well, whose blood should we use this time?

614
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:29,395
Should we do a random draw?

615
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,964
I think we can use your blood this time.

616
00:43:34,964 --> 00:43:37,904
No. The doctor ought to volunteer.

617
00:43:37,964 --> 00:43:41,004
- You can cut and fix yourself!
- Hey.

618
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:42,274
- Gosh.
- Come here.

619
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:45,074
- Hey, stop it.
- I could really get hurt.

620
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:47,674
- What are you doing?
- I could get hurt from that!

621
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:49,074
Stop it.

622
00:43:49,145 --> 00:43:51,344
- He can do it himself.
- That's enough!

623
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:53,984
- Stop it. Come on.
- What are you doing?

624
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,515
Calm down!

625
00:44:00,285 --> 00:44:02,225
- Stop it.
- He's a nutcase!

626
00:44:02,295 --> 00:44:04,194
- This is crazy.
- Come on!

627
00:44:05,424 --> 00:44:09,094
Before that, shouldn't we talk about
the food and water?

628
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:11,335
If you have any suggestions,
do share them with us.

629
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:13,535
We are thinking about going out.

630
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:16,335
If Mr. Kim from the 15th floor indeed left,

631
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,245
there is a way out of this apartment complex.

632
00:44:18,304 --> 00:44:20,074
So we want to check if we can...

633
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:21,774
bring food or water from outside.

634
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:24,884
There's the emergency switch-over
in the basement of the building.

635
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:26,815
Instead of going out which is dangerous,

636
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:29,714
we can go down there and turn that on.

637
00:44:29,785 --> 00:44:32,185
We can cook food once the power is back on.

638
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,225
Then we'll have water too.

639
00:44:35,054 --> 00:44:36,125
Building 103.

640
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:38,424
In the Electrical Room
under the senior citizen center,

641
00:44:38,464 --> 00:44:39,924
there's an emergency switch-over called EPS.

642
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:43,864
It's there to control the lights
and elevators during emergencies.

643
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:45,634
If you power that up,

644
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:47,864
power and water will come back on.

645
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,605
You know what? I'll be honest with you.

646
00:44:51,444 --> 00:44:54,944
You two might leave and not come back.

647
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:57,145
I see. Right.

648
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:01,554
You were pretty cozy with that military guy.

649
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:08,895
Like Mr. Oh said, we should try
to solve this within the building.

650
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:18,804
Sure.

651
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:23,035
We'll go down there and turn on the switch.

652
00:45:31,515 --> 00:45:32,545
Mr. Oh.

653
00:45:34,214 --> 00:45:36,455
How did you know about the emergency switch-over?

654
00:45:36,515 --> 00:45:39,324
Everyone who lives in apartment buildings
knows that.

655
00:45:39,384 --> 00:45:41,054
I know that you have it out for me.

656
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:44,194
But this is an emergency.
We're in a crisis.

657
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:48,194
So why don't you stop hating me
for the sake of everyone's benefit?

658
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:51,935
We need to live like civilized people.

659
00:45:55,435 --> 00:45:56,904
Are you really going down to the Electrical Room?

660
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:00,304
He does seem a bit suspicious.

661
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:02,214
But it is true we need power and water.

662
00:46:02,515 --> 00:46:03,674
Right.

663
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,185
It's a chance to send out Seo Yoon.

664
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:09,153
Before we go down to the Electrical Room,

665
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:10,554
we should send her out.

666
00:46:12,024 --> 00:46:13,554
What should we say to Seo Yoon?

667
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,125
We can keep it a secret for now.

668
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,364
If she finds out
she's the only one leaving,

669
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:19,924
she might not want to.

670
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:24,935
Right. She's mature for her age.

671
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:28,004
Well, we can go down without a problem.

672
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:29,975
But how will we come up?

673
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:34,375
Remember how it gets really loud
when the electricity is running?

674
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:37,674
When they hear the noise,
infected people will flock there.

675
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:39,884
They'll come to our building.

676
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:41,855
And if the main entrance gets compromised,

677
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,054
it can get more dangerous.

678
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,024
We can take a different path.

679
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:49,694
Let's go.

680
00:47:00,605 --> 00:47:01,674
Sleep some more.

681
00:48:16,815 --> 00:48:17,844
Prepare to infiltrate too.

682
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:20,045
If we don't hear from him by morning,
we're going in.

683
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:23,085
There are a lot of patients
with severe mutations in there.

684
00:48:23,554 --> 00:48:25,285
If we go in
without scoping the place out first,

685
00:48:25,355 --> 00:48:26,984
someone will end up dying.

686
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,024
As long as Yoon Sae Bom is safe.

687
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,054
Lieutenant Colonel Han.

688
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:35,065
Have you decided?

689
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:36,464
I'll send out...

690
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:39,634
Sae Bom and Seo Yoon.

691
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:43,035
I'll go down to the parking garage at 1pm,

692
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:45,304
so be prepared to take them.

693
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:46,774
What about you?

694
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:48,145
Aren't you going to come out too?

695
00:48:49,574 --> 00:48:51,074
Someone needs to stay home.

696
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:54,785
We may have had our differences,

697
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,815
but I'm well aware that you tried
to stop the spread of the disease.

698
00:49:01,594 --> 00:49:02,725
Please help Sae Bom...

699
00:49:03,995 --> 00:49:05,125
and Seo Yoon...

700
00:49:06,024 --> 00:49:07,864
stay safe.

701
00:49:16,435 --> 00:49:18,004
Jung Yi Hyun is infected.

702
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:20,875
That's why he wants to send Yoon Sae Bom out.

703
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:04,776
See?

704
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:07,436
Goodness.

705
00:50:07,506 --> 00:50:08,646
Let's play again.

706
00:50:09,805 --> 00:50:11,006
You want to play again?

707
00:50:11,546 --> 00:50:13,046
Until I win.

708
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,765
- Yi Hyun.
- Yes?

709
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:31,965
Can we talk?

710
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:42,646
Oh, I talked to Han Tae Seok,

711
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:45,115
and soldiers are going to
come to the basement garage.

712
00:50:46,816 --> 00:50:49,385
We'll send Seo Yoon out
and then go down to the Electrical Room.

713
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,615
You've got something in your eyes again.

714
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:00,756
Remember how we told each other...

715
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:05,796
that we should tell each other
if we get sick?

716
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:10,905
If I feel the thirst
and I want to bite people,

717
00:51:10,965 --> 00:51:12,336
I will tell you.

718
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,006
So...

719
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:18,715
if something happens to you, tell me.

720
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:20,916
Are you okay?

721
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,155
Of course. I'm fine. Why?

722
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:29,526
Are you worried that my cut is infected?

723
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:32,756
I thought about it,

724
00:51:35,066 --> 00:51:36,495
and the cut on your hand...

725
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,495
healed too quickly.

726
00:51:40,936 --> 00:51:42,066
You don't drink water either.

727
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:47,075
It looks like it has gotten a lot better.

728
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:51,376
I told you. I'm a human vitamin
and a human antibiotic.

729
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,345
Hey.

730
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:55,945
It's not true.

731
00:51:56,015 --> 00:51:57,986
It still hurts a lot.

732
00:51:58,555 --> 00:51:59,686
See?

733
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:02,726
I didn't realize it...

734
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,356
because I was so shocked
from seeing Lee Deok Soon's body.

735
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,595
but I think it popped open again.

736
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:11,325
That's good.

737
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:14,265
I was so worried.

738
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,635
You should've said something
instead of worrying.

739
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:19,876
What else could I do? There's no cure.

740
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:23,776
What if it gets infected?

741
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:25,715
I told you to be careful.

742
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:28,615
Okay.

743
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:30,615
I'll be careful from now on.

744
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:35,986
Hey.

745
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:41,526
Lieutenant Colonel Han.

746
00:52:41,595 --> 00:52:43,195
I know you're there.

747
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,836
Can you prepare plenty of...

748
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:47,965
antibiotics, antiseptics,
and bandages for us?

749
00:52:51,106 --> 00:52:52,376
Yi Hyun got hurt.

750
00:52:53,976 --> 00:52:55,206
I'll get that ready.

751
00:52:57,976 --> 00:52:59,845
It's so nice to hear your voice.

752
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:01,646
What about Kim Se Hoon?

753
00:53:02,615 --> 00:53:04,856
He might be infected,
so you need to be careful.

754
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,416
Kim Se Hoon isn't outside.

755
00:53:07,715 --> 00:53:09,585
It's highly likely
that he's hiding inside the apartments,

756
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,655
so be careful.

757
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:12,595
Once he's had the taste of blood,

758
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:15,865
he will keep going after people.

759
00:53:17,066 --> 00:53:18,166
Thank you.

760
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:23,206
Let's look for Kim Se Hoon one more time.

761
00:53:26,476 --> 00:53:27,606
Okay.

762
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:37,745
Jung Guk. Don't open the door for anyone.

763
00:53:37,816 --> 00:53:40,416
Kim Se Hoon might still be in here.

764
00:53:40,486 --> 00:53:41,756
Okay. Don't worry.

765
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,086
I have my gun.

766
00:53:44,256 --> 00:53:45,356
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

767
00:53:52,736 --> 00:53:53,995
Kim Se Hoon...

768
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:55,836
might still be in here.

769
00:53:56,936 --> 00:54:00,135
He said he was making a bunker somewhere.

770
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:02,575
He might have a secret hiding spot
inside his home.

771
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:04,575
Even still... Do you really think so?

772
00:54:04,646 --> 00:54:06,646
He could be hiding in here.

773
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:08,816
We don't even know the layout
of this place either.

774
00:54:11,385 --> 00:54:12,586
Andrew?

775
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:39,615
Let's send Seo Yoon out first.

776
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:41,546
We can always look into it later.

777
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:43,885
What if someone gets hurt?

778
00:54:47,055 --> 00:54:49,226
I'll look for Andrew on my way down,

779
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,385
so take a look around here.

780
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:51,925
Okay.

781
00:55:03,236 --> 00:55:05,236
Sae Bom. Do you hear me?

782
00:55:08,345 --> 00:55:09,506
First Lieutenant Lee.

783
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:11,146
It's nice to hear your voice,

784
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:13,945
but I'm a bit busy right now.

785
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:15,686
This is really important.

786
00:55:16,285 --> 00:55:19,115
We got the background check back
on the people inside the apartment,

787
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,215
and we found something weird.

788
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:05,736
Ahn Guk Jin...

789
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:07,896
was found dead in his home.

790
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,635
(Ahn Guk Jin)

791
00:56:14,876 --> 00:56:16,276
Oh, I scratched it out.

792
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:23,186
Administrative Affairs has been on hold
because of the disease.

793
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:25,986
It took a while for the report to reach us.

794
00:56:30,126 --> 00:56:31,256
What about his face?

795
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:35,325
Does he have a scar?

796
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:00,055
No, not at all.

797
00:57:05,495 --> 00:57:06,726
How dangerous is it?

798
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,896
It'll take us four or five hours to get there.

799
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:15,265
Stay at home until then.

800
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,035
We'll come over and sort things out.

801
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:24,805
Ms. Yoon, are you listening?

802
00:57:32,256 --> 00:57:34,416
(Kim Se Hoon)

803
00:57:51,706 --> 00:57:54,936
(Lee Deok Soon)

804
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,226
Kim Se Hoon.

805
00:58:11,896 --> 00:58:12,896
I found him.

806
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:16,995
Hang on.

807
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:20,265
Take your time and relax.

808
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:26,336
- What is it?
- I saw Kim Se Hoon.

809
00:58:26,405 --> 00:58:28,476
Open the door. He might come after me.

810
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:35,245
Is he sick?

811
00:58:36,686 --> 00:58:37,686
What...

812
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:47,626
I'll call if we need help. Wait.

813
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:06,115
Go on. It's your turn.

814
00:59:29,506 --> 00:59:30,905
What are you doing?

815
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:35,805
My husband.

816
00:59:37,976 --> 00:59:39,916
He died because of you two.

817
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:05,876
Jung Guk!

818
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,976
Jung Guk. Wake up.

819
01:00:09,146 --> 01:00:10,945
It's me, Yi Hyun.

820
01:00:26,095 --> 01:00:27,155
Who are you?

821
01:00:51,245 --> 01:00:56,086
=Happiness=

822
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:15,376
I have a suggestion.

823
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:19,215
About how to deal with
the people we don't like.

824
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:20,575
I know who you are.

825
01:01:20,646 --> 01:01:21,945
Turn the power on and come back.

826
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:24,745
Then I'll let Seo Yoon and the detective go.

827
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:27,356
The infected will attack!

828

Go!

829
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:31,055
We will get out alive...
