Ms. Oh went somewhere with Mr. Kim.

17
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,123
They both seemed a bit weird...

18
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:30,593
Hello.

19
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:34,093
Mr. Kim.

20
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:36,593
Hi.

21
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,002
Do you feel thirsty too?

22
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,303
Don't you dare go after her.

23
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:48,803
Talk to me if you must.

24
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:52,572
You too.

25
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:57,553
Sae Bom. We must figure out who's infected.

26
00:01:57,613 --> 00:02:00,283
You could've gotten sick without knowing.

27
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:03,753
Stand up straight. You're enforcing order.

28
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,633
You still have a lot of water and food.

29
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,333
We'll stay indoors.

30
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:16,202
Can you stop all this and leave?

31
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:17,932
Right this moment.

32
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,402
My patience...

33
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,542
is running really thin.

34
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:24,572
Do you see that glare?

35
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,283
Why won't you aim your gun at her?

36
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:52,333
He's really out of his mind.

37
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,413
Hey, mister.

38
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,372
What are you looking for?

39
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,083
What do you need?

40
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,453
I was just...

41
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,483
It doesn't look like a newlyweds' home.

42
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,323
It's much better without you around.

43
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:13,662
But about that kid.

44
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:15,023
Shouldn't she be staying somewhere else?

45
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,062
What if either of you bites her?

46
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,863
Where should she stay, then?
At your place?

47
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,103
She can do that.

48
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:22,932
I'm good with kids.

49
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,203
I can tutor her too.

50
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:28,972
You're here for the pills, aren't you?

51
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:31,143
The pills that cause the disease.

52
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,513
Give me all you have,

53
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,513
and lie low in your apartment.

54
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,323
Then I'll let you stay.

55
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,453
What do you need them for?

56
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,692
You already failed
trying to infect everyone.

57
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:48,523
I did some thinking.

58
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,333
Those pills kept my wife alive...

59
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:53,303
even after her head was bashed in.

60
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,632
I'll take the pills if I'm ever in danger.

61
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,632
That will eliminate the chances...

62
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:00,573
of me dying of blood loss
even if a freak bites me.

63
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,173
I can get sick but feel no pain.

64
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,543
Aren't you afraid of the disease?

65
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:06,912
Why should I be?

66
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,412
The infected feel no fear.

67
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:12,613
Mister.

68
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,923
This isn't a narcotic.

69
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:18,553
Gosh.

70
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:33,743
What were you doing in there?

71
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:35,942
Weren't you on the third floor?

72
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:39,273
The detective in Unit 501 said
I could stay there instead.

73
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,212
Is something wrong?

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,622
Well, the others are saying
these people are infected.

75
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:50,053
Did they come at you like this, trying to bite you?

76
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,122
No, they didn't.

77
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:59,493
Honey. Are you sure they're infected?

78
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:00,562
I'll explain later.

79
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:03,532
All that happened is on you.

80
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:09,142
Since you're all here, let's talk about this.

81
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,413
We need to figure out...

82
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,942
what to do with the people in Unit 501.

83
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,213
You lot!

84
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:18,413
Have your talk
in the resident representative's home.

85
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,983
It's practically empty with lots of room!

86
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,353
Every one of you can get inside...

87
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,122
and still have room to spare, right?

88
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,093
Detective!

89
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:34,262
Sae Bom. What are you doing?

90
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:36,832
Don't, Sae Bom.

91
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,502
Take a deep breath.

92
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,072
Be calm.

93
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:41,642
Good.

94
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:43,872
You can all go now.

95
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:45,473
Come with me.

96
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,783
(SY Home Cleaning)

97
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,452
Sae Bom.

98
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:58,423
Are you all right?

99
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:00,723
Don't you feel thirsty?

100
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,132
I'm really disappointed with you.

101
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:15,803
She's right. Ms. Oh's home is a good spot.

102
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:17,512
Let's check out the Royal Floor.

103
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:21,613
That's right. Our Unit 201 is too shabby
for important people.

104
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:25,553
My apartment isn't very clean.

105
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:27,783
I don't mind that at all.

106
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,293
Ms. Oh's apartment would be a great place to meet.

107
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:31,723
Let's check it out.

108
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:32,993
- Let's go.
- Let's go upstairs.

109
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:34,522
Come along. Let's go.

110
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:36,463
- But...
- Let's go.

111
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,733
Are you okay?

112
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:44,372
Do you think I want Sae Bom to get sick?

113
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,072
I was just worried.
You saw the cut on her hand.

114
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:50,343
That's really nothing. It's just a cut.

115
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:53,283
You're worried about nothing.

116
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,252
You go inside.

117
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:02,353
I'll stand guard outside the door.

118
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:05,022
If nothing happens after a few days,

119
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,593
I'm sure the others will calm down.

120
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,033
Jung Guk. Be careful. Those people...

121
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,733
can't be trusted.

122
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,743
It's really high up.

123
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,642
My goodness.

124
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:23,272
It is.

125
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,582
The Royal Floor isn't all that great.

126
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:29,752
I made a huge sacrifice
by going down to talk to you.

127
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:32,613
Next time, we can talk downstairs.

128
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:35,752
Gosh. There's nothing here.

129
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:38,553
Are you sure you live here?

130
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:42,322
It'll cost quite a lot
to clean this whole apartment.

131
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,692
What reverend drinks so much alcohol?

132
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,963
What should we do with the infected people?

133
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,903
You saw what Ms. Yoon was like.

134
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,903
She could suddenly barge in here.

135
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,173
Didn't the lawyer from Unit 601 talk
about an emergency evacuation?

136
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:00,613
Why haven't I seen him today?

137
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,713
I'll talk to him about it.

138
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,853
I don't think it applies, though.

139
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,923
Unit 501 is their rightful home,

140
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,223
and they haven't shown any symptoms.

141
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,723
She's right. They haven't caused a nuisance.

142
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:16,692
There's proof that Unit 501's female detective...

143
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:18,192
is infected.

144
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:21,903
It might be better to kick them out entirely.

145
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,502
People who have nothing to lose...

146
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,642
become surprisingly brazen.

147
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,673
The infected show symptoms
once they drink water.

148
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,582
Isn't it dangerous to leave them
with so much of it?

149
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,182
You're right.

150
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:38,283
They had a lot of water.

151
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,423
We can't throw it all out.

152
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:44,153
The lockdown got extended,
and we're all short on supplies.

153
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,522
The rest of us...

154
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:48,363
can split their supplies equally.

155
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,733
My gosh.

156
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,502
I think they're all terrible.

157
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,442
They're not bad people, though.

158
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,113
They're just afraid.

159
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:07,182
The man from Unit 601 too?

160
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,283
He's an exception.

161
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,613
Don't go anywhere near him,

162
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:11,752
and don't even answer him.

163
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,452
Pretend he's invisible, okay?

164
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:14,752
- Don't even look at him.
- Right.

165
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,723
By the way, what Jung Guk did
was really messed up.

166
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,752
You know, we've known each other
for over a decade now.

167
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,333
I'm not taking his side or anything.

168
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:25,693
He hasn't been able to go home
for several days now.

169
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:27,233
Imagine how much he misses his wife.

170
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,402
And he must be worried sick.

171
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,272
You know that I grade people, right?

172
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,502
I give a point for a good deed...

173
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,042
and deduct a point when they mess up.

174
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:37,743
He's in the negative now.

175
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,713
Then give some of my points.
I'm sure I have a lot of...

176
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,183
I have points. Right?

177
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,703
The detective went upstairs with them.

178
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,473
Go up where?

179
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:08,642
They are coming up with a plan
to kick the two of you out.

180
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:11,012
When he heard that, he went upstairs.

181
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:17,683
And send us where?

182
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,282
Outside.

183
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,382
They are going to take your water and food too.

184
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:29,262
Stay with Seo Yoon for a bit.

185
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,863
Hey, Sae Bom.

186
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,563
Sae Bom. Don't get so worked up!

187
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,103
Are you worried?

188
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,132
Not about her.

189
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:41,443
But the residents.

190
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:48,343
She's a civil servant.
If she bites people,

191
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,483
she'll lose her house.
I'm sure you all know that.

192
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,083
Sae Bom was so happy
that she could buy an apartment.

193
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:56,022
Come on. You're her neighbours.
Why are you so harsh on her?

194
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,622
Hey, Sae Bom.

195
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,892
Why are you here?

196
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:04,433
I'll explain everything to them.
Go stay in your house.

197
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:06,802
Come on, Detective. She has a knife!

198
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:11,473
What were you all talking about?

199
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:15,573
- My gosh!
- What are you doing?

200
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,473
Oh no!

201
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:26,282
What? Are you going to shoot me?

202
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,752
Are you going to kill everyone here?

203
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:29,723
Hey, Sae Bom.

204
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,552
Calm down. Please?

205
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:33,463
That's fine! Don't stop her.

206
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:34,963
She doesn't even have the guts to shoot me.

207
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,223
Go ahead!

208
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,052
The first one is always a blank for cops.

209
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:01,782
So what are you going to do now?

210
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,522
You're going to threaten us...

211
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,792
and continue to leave here
when you are infected?

212
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,693
I came up because I was furious.

213
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:12,093
Since everyone is here,

214
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,632
should we really...

215
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,463
see who's infected?

216
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,073
Is there a way to check?

217
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:24,443
I'm sure you all know
that the infected people get thirsty.

218
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,412
What do you think will happen to them
if they see blood...

219
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,213
after they have been suppressing
and hiding their thirst?

220
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:30,813
Where's the blood?

221
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,683
Right here.

222
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:51,632
Darn it.

223
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:53,973
I'm fine.

224
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,892
Gross.

225
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:56,402
=Happiness=

226
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:14,953
She calmed down just now.

227
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:18,323
What do we do now?

228
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:19,823
We should wait...

229
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:21,963
until we can talk to her.

230
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,392
Since Jung Guk is here now,

231
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:28,632
you go upstairs and treat your wound.

232
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,372
If she keeps smelling blood,
it will be harder on her.

233
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,113
Can you stay here, Jung Guk?

234
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,353
We must find out
if she got bitten or took the drug.

235
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,622
Okay. I'll ask her later.

236
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:54,363
Hey.

237
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,333
Let's hurry back.

238
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,733
I don't want your wound to get infected.

239
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,302
Calm down. Okay?

240
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,433
You might not know,
but my immune system is pretty strong.

241
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,603
Hey.

242
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,142
Bo Ram is moving.

243
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,843
I'll go by myself.
You should go back inside.

244
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:17,613
I know how to treat a cut like this.

245
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,853
I just need to stop the bleeding.

246
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:21,723
Apply some ointment.

247
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:22,922
And put a new towel on it.

248
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:24,953
Keep your hand elevated.

249
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,522
And lie still.

250
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,213
Hey.

251
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:45,943
Give me some water too.

252
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,083
Gosh. That scared me.
Give me some water.

253
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:50,183
Is this your water?

254
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:57,252
You should all go back.

255
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,563
I don't think we can continue our discussion now.

256
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,093
Honey, let's go.

257
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,142
Gosh. You're still here.

258
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:16,372
What is it?

259
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,113
Not so fast.

260
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,583
Not after what you did to Sae Bom.

261
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:23,552
Shouldn't we check
if there are more infected people?

262
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:26,282
For all we know, you could be infected too, Mr. Oh.

263
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,323
Don't you agree?

264
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:32,552
You too, ma'am.

265
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,603
I'm coming in.

266
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:49,402
Get out now.

267
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,743
I might turn again.

268
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,172
Don't worry.

269
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:54,912
Your symptoms went away just now.

270
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,083
So you won't have another fit for some time.

271
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,752
I came here to talk about something important.

272
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:06,723
We need to find out...

273
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:09,392
how you got infected.
So with that information,

274
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,463
we can prepare ourselves too.

275
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,532
Did you...

276
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,703
take any drugs from the gym?

277
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,943
I got infected at the supermarket.

278
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:26,042
When I hid to stay away
from the other infected people,

279
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,683
they must have scratched my leg.

280
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,392
If I told you the truth,

281
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:41,122
I was worried
that you wouldn't let me into the apartment.

282
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:43,593
I was scared.

283
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,162
No one is going to come down here.

284
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:48,402
Get some rest.

285
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:52,402
Thank you.

286
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:55,572
If it weren't for you,

287
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:58,112
I might have bitten anyone I could.

288
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,683
We don't know that.

289
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,312
You might have been able...

290
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:07,082
to hold out without biting anyone.

291
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:13,193
Did you throw out the blood-stained towel...

292
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:15,693
in the emergency staircase?
It was in the trash bag.

293
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:18,193
No.

294
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,733
That wasn't me.

295
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,213
What is it? Is someone outside?

296
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:34,112
(No Entry, Risk of Infection)

297
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,483
I can hear sounds from outside.

298
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:38,483
From the indoor driving range.

299
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,223
Isn't...

300
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,393
Mr. Na Soo Min in there?

301
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,832
So...

302
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:00,302
I just need you to say that you think...

303
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,473
the woman on the fifth floor is also infected.

304
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,282
- What is it?
- I heard...

305
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,282
some kind of sound from there.

306
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,352
Who would come down here
where the infected people are?

307
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:18,822
Oh, right.

308
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,792
Do you play golf too?

309
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,993
I play screen golf occasionally.

310
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:28,903
I see. Then you can practice
while you're here.

311
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,532
You'll leave here as a single player.

312
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,512
You should get the treatment once it's made...

313
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:46,183
and go home safely.

314
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,582
If people find out you had mad person disease,

315
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,453
your family wouldn't be happy.

316
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:53,923
Is it because of that woman
on the fifth floor?

317
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,723
Because she works for the Police SOU?

318
00:19:58,393 --> 00:20:01,332
I served in the military too. KATUSA.

319
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:05,203
I was in the defence force
in Kentucky as well.

320
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,302
I can tell when I look at people,

321
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,002
and that woman is no threat.

322
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:11,272
Are you sure?

323
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,713
Did you really serve in the military?

324
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,683
I was a military chaplain.

325
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:22,582
Go home. I'm sure your wife is in shock.

326
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:24,393
Oh, right.

327
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:28,423
Goodbye.

328
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,663
Leave the golf club.

329
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:36,163
Okay.

330
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:45,473
When you get back,
tell the others about the situation...

331
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,973
and be careful.

332
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,183
When you meet people, always meet in groups.

333
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:50,243
Okay.

334
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,383
Thank you.

335
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,463
Be careful you don't catch it, Mr. Oh.

336
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:04,332
Don't worry. I'm always careful.

337
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,393
You should change your pants
when you get home.

338
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:08,433
They look a little wet.

339
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,473
Can you please leave?
So that I can be alone?

340
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:16,342
You should stay home for the time being too.

341
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,612
It might still be in the incubation period.

342
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:41,262
What the...

343
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,733
What on earth is going on?

344
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:48,703
Honey.

345
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:51,373
What happened?

346
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:55,512
What?

347
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:57,512
Oh, my.

348
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,123
Oh, dear...

349
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,193
- What are you doing?
- There's blood here.

350
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,633
The couple on the fifth floor
did something crazy again.

351
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,903
We have to get the residents together again.

352
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:53,473
This time, we're going to get rid of
all the people who were infected!

353
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:07,322
Where were you?

354
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:11,153
I'm pretty sure you said you'd stay at home.

355
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:15,623
I did. While keeping my hand up and laying down.

356
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:22,562
But I had a really good idea on my way up.

357
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:29,703
How good was your idea?

358
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:33,713
Listen.

359
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:35,282
I'm already bleeding,

360
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:37,883
so it would be good to find more infected people.

361
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,623
So did you find any infected people?

362
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:46,352
No.

363
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,393
Well, that's a good thing.

364
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:54,463
This isn't.

365
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,733
You could put some ointment on it for me.

366
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:59,873
It'll get better really quick.

367
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:00,943
Let's go inside.

368
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,542
What are you doing?

369
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:12,983
Right...

370
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:16,953
I'm too embarrassed to face you.

371
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:20,792
I'm really gullible,
so I ended up causing you more trouble.

372
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:23,923
I'll stay on the second floor or the gym.

373
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:27,633
I don't think I can face Seo Yoon either.

374
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:29,933
It's fine. Just come inside.

375
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:31,802
We have to treat Yi Hyun's cut.

376
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:36,643
Jung Guk.

377
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:40,782
Cheer up.

378
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:43,782
If you have any worries from now on,
share them with us.

379
00:24:48,582 --> 00:24:49,883
Don't betray us.

380
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,822
I didn't...

381
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:54,963
It was my first time betraying anyone.

382
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:56,693
Goodness.

383
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,403
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

384
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:06,502
What? Thanks.

385
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:09,342
Hey.

386
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:13,213
I'll work hard.

387
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:21,653
Hurry up. Let's go inside.

388
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,592
Did you get hurt badly?

389
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:35,102
What? No. It's just a tiny scratch.

390
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,973
Not from an infected person but from a knife.

391
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:41,373
- Hey...
- Nobody did it to me. I did it.

392
00:25:41,443 --> 00:25:45,373
Seo Yoon. He needs to get treated,
so let's go out.

393
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,413
- I hurt myself...
- Hey.

394
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,282
- Let's go.
- Sit here.

395
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,522
How could you...

396
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:02,522
You look totally normal,

397
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:05,393
so how could you cause trouble like that?

398
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:10,163
What should I do? Just watch you cut yourself?

399
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:12,173
Should I have praised you
and said it was pretty?

400
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,002
Are you and I the same?

401
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,012
I would've given myself a small cut.
A couple of drops.

402
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:21,782
You could've just scared them,
but you were gushing blood.

403
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:24,082
It's because I have a strong heart.

404
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,383
I just bled a lot.

405
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,883
All of my veins and muscles are all intact. See?

406
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:30,153
Do you think I'm that dumb?

407
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,302
See? It's fine. Isn't it?

408
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,042
It's not?

409
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,743
Will I not be able to use my hand again?

410
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:02,183
You won't need stitches.

411
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:05,893
Okay.

412
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,322
Don't do this again.

413
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,022
I don't feel good because you got hurt.

414
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:11,693
My stomach hurts,

415
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:14,562
and I don't think I can eat dinner.

416
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:15,963
I feel the same way.

417
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:20,173
All of those people were glaring at you,

418
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,243
and you were holding a knife
threatening to cut yourself.

419
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:23,443
So how can I sit by and do nothing?

420
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:24,512
I...

421
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,213
I can do this, but you can't.

422
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,782
- Why not?
- Just don't do it.

423
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:36,453
My gosh.

424
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,373
I thought she was infected.
Why is she still there?

425
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:53,703
Stop overreacting.

426
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,302
You said she was infected.

427
00:27:58,312 --> 00:27:59,943
Are you sure they tied her up?

428
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:02,713
Can you move?

429
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,322
I'll take her out.

430
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,163
Take care of the situation in here.

431
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,342
Oh, my.

432
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:35,012
Gosh.

433
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:40,483
Darn it.

434
00:28:41,782 --> 00:28:42,822
Where do you want to go?

435
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,352
There's a room in the golfing range.

436
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:46,123
I feel suffocated.

437
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,092
I want to go anywhere that's open.

438
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:50,623
Okay.

439
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,943
Everyone who needs to be here is here.

440
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:03,473
The 15th floor never comes,

441
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,413
and the old couple on the third floor...

442
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:07,312
want to stay at home.

443
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:08,782
The reverend isn't here.

444
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,413
He's not feeling well,
so he wants to stay home.

445
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,483
Check to be sure he isn't infected.

446
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:14,852
What?

447
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:17,082
Come on.

448
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:18,352
Calm down, everyone.

449
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,052
The cleaning lady's not here either.

450
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:22,022
Is she...

451
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:23,292
at your place?

452
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:25,193
No, she didn't come to my place.

453
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:26,532
Didn't she go to the basement?

454
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,633
She said there was a staff room down there.

455
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:31,002
Let's get this done quickly
without wasting more time.

456
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,272
You said they went crazy
when they saw blood.

457
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:38,943
It's really not me.

458
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:41,582
Detective, can you speed it up?

459
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,512
- Get me a cup.
- Okay.

460
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:47,653
Then...

461
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:50,282
you can...

462
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,522
do the honours, Mr. Kook.

463
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,123
You have a knife there too.

464
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,693
Fill the cup halfway like you would with urine.

465
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:02,002
This is something a cop should do.

466
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:04,602
You already have a cut.

467
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:06,173
Yes, he's right.

468
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,102
Should I cut it back open?

469
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,903
I'm not here to donate blood,

470
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:12,373
so volunteer yourself.

471
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,042
Anyone?

472
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:19,352
No one?

473
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:33,993
Will this do?

474
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:38,903
Stop the bleeding.

475
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:41,673
Do you feel better now?

476
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:45,173
Here.

477
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,512
If someone here is infected,

478
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:53,413
they should react to this.

479
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,332
Oh, come on.

480
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,062
Come here.

481
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:14,842
Be careful.

482
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,473
Look into the cup.

483
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:20,772
You're fine, aren't you?

484
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:22,383
Yes.

485
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:24,782
Do you mean...

486
00:31:25,153 --> 00:31:27,082
none of us are infected?

487
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,052
Yes.

488
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:33,393
Then now we can talk about rations.

489
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,663
You on the second floor,
are you trying to extort us?

490
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:38,133
I heard you were demanding a nonsensical amount.

491
00:31:38,193 --> 00:31:39,433
How is it nonsensical?

492
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,403
Supply and demand.
Don't you know capitalism?

493
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:43,062
You live in such a nice apartment...

494
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,873
and you can't afford that much?

495
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,373
You're a bit rude.

496
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:48,373
Where are your manners?

497
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:49,873
We're being very polite.

498
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:52,473
You talked down to us just now.

499
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:54,643
What do you know about capitalism?

500
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:59,483
We observed a mutation
among critically ill patients.

501
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:00,653
What's the difference?

502
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,052
They can adjust the interval
between the outbursts.

503
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:05,522
They suppress the thirst,

504
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,393
then show symptoms only
when they're sure they're safe.

505
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:12,233
The disease is as cunning as humans.

506
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:15,602
Our superiors want another contingency plan.

507
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:18,332
But we can't find enough mutation samples.

508
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:21,502
How is he now?

509
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:24,673
We just gave him a cocktail of sedatives.

510
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:27,772
He'll stay normal for about ten minutes,

511
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:29,312
but it's likely...

512
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,082
once he turns, he will never recover again.

513
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,453
Ten minutes is enough.

514
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:43,262
How have you been?

515
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:48,633
You caused me a lot of trouble,
so I took my time.

516
00:32:51,473 --> 00:32:52,502
Your funeral...

517
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:54,673
went smoothly.

518
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,612
Some cried to hear
you dropped out of the clinical tests.

519
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,713
When things go back to normal,

520
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:07,582
you'll get a medal for exemplary service.

521
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:11,183
Your children wept a lot.

522
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:15,193
You didn't tell them
about your slush fund, did you?

523
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:18,133
Do you think I'll go out like this?

524
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:19,792
Of course not.

525
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:21,092
We're still running tests.

526
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:22,502
The authorities...

527
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:27,072
are making you
make the tough decisions, aren't they?

528
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:29,842
Do you think you'll become famous...

529
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:31,772
if you hold your ground until a cure is found?

530
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:34,713
You won't.

531
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:36,483
Once the hunt is over,

532
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,913
there's no use for the hound.

533
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:45,092
Your wife and your child.

534
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,623
They'll all end up like me.

535
00:33:57,562 --> 00:33:59,032
You have about five more minutes...

536
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:00,703
to talk like a sane man.

537
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:04,143
I'm a hound?

538
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,883
Once I find a cure,

539
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:13,252
who do you think will be treated like a dog?

540
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:18,993
Where is Sae Bom's blood panel?

541
00:34:19,252 --> 00:34:21,322
They'll be out tomorrow at the earliest.

542
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:24,562
- We need more critical mutations?
- Yes.

543
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:26,733
They can hide their thirst well,

544
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,562
and you can't tell them apart.

545
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:33,032
We can't just wait
until infected people develop a mutation.

546
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,602
Seyang Forest.

547
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,042
That's where...

548
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,312
a lot of the critical cases are.

549
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:47,483
They went into lockdown ten days ago.

550
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,383
They must have a few cases of mutations too.

551
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:56,562
Is that why you insisted
on keeping them in there?

552
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,692
To trace any mutations?

553
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,862
We need to find out how the virus changes
over time in nature.

554
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:07,003
They're like a container
where you cultivate a virus.

555
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:12,643
You must've thought that, if lucky,
they'd develop antibodies too.

556
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:15,743
Crack open the gate...

557
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,313
enough for just one person to escape.

558
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:19,453
The infected will try to get out.

559
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:21,052
Grab them and continue the research.

560
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:37,779
You told your husband...

561
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,380
you will be here, right?

562
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:40,509
Yes.

563
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:42,920
I need to ask for a favour.

564
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,190
You have some stuff needed...

565
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,849
for outdoor survival, right?

566
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,759
Could you share some water and food too?

567
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,460
It's not for me.

568
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:53,790
Someone else...

569
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,599
is on the rooftop.

570
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
Stay here for now.

571
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,699
I'll lock all the doors that lead downstairs.

572
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,869
Thank you so much.

573
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,810
I brought some food and water too.

574
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:11,139
(Unit 1501 Kim Se Hoon)

575
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:13,710
I'll bring some of our stuff too.

576
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,119
Don't bring any water.

577
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,020
The more I drink, the thirstier I feel.

578
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:20,590
It's better to just wet my lips.

579
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,860
The cooler...

580
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,090
You didn't drink then either, did you?

581
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,469
- I didn't.
- Who else didn't drink...

582
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:37,270
any of the drinks?

583
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,210
(Cream Bread)

584
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,270
I brought only a little water on purpose.

585
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,509
Drink just a little,

586
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,210
and tell us if you feel the thirst.

587
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,750
I'll untie you while you...

588
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,659
Don't come close.

589
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,489
If you get closer,

590
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,299
the thirst gets worse.

591
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,869
It's fine. I'll eat with the handcuffs on.

592
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,310
Were you okay yesterday?

593
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:16,139
The reverend from the 12th floor was here.

594
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:18,610
Didn't he stay for a long time?

595
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,310
But...

596
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,349
with him, I didn't really...

597
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,560
Do they pick their victims?

598
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,329
Mosquitoes target just one person in a group.

599
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:35,159
Jung Guk.

600
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,860
You said the infected didn't attack the reverend.

601
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,599
He's a very devout man.

602
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,540
He's holy.

603
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,650
Our Father, who art in heaven,

604
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,150
hallowed be thy name,

605
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,690
thy kingdom come,

606
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,659
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

607
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:10,029
Give us this day our daily bread.

608
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:12,270
Please...

609
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,230
Please...

610
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,060
You didn't clean up all the blood yet?

611
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,960
Did you find more infected people?

612
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,699
Not yet.

613
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:19,299
I should check on the people
on the 3rd and 15th floors too.

614
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,900
I should win them over by keeping the apartment safe.

615
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,070
Sounds good, right?

616
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Gosh.

617
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:31,650
Blood.

618
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:34,920
We need blood to check
and catch these infected people.

619
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:38,520
It's from that guy with the mask
from the second floor.

620
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,949
Gosh. He's an oddball too.

621
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,360
Bite me if you want to.

622
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,869
What?

623
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,570
Am I losing hair?

624
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,869
Yes. A bit.

625
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,909
What?

626
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,170
Really?

627
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:03,480
Oh no.

628
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,429
Tell me which part is thinning out.

629
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,799
No. You look fine.

630
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,210
- Hey.
- What about Bo Ram?

631
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:37,909
She's okay.

632
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:40,810
By the way, remember the water in the icebox?

633
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Yes.

634
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:43,579
The reverend didn't drink water from the icebox.

635
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,250
I was thinking the same thing too.

636
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,219
The infected people didn't go for the reverend.

637
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,460
Right? He's a fake reverend too.

638
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,389
- It's odd, isn't it?
- We should go check.

639
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,690
The point of the virus is to spread it.

640
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:56,429
So they stop sucking blood
when they know the victims are infected.

641
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,900
Then do you think infected people
will go after each other?

642
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:02,000
- Probably not.
- Right. It only makes sense...

643
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,500
when they don't crave each other's blood.

644
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,239
Then the reverend is...

645
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,810
We should check.

646
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,960
It's a misunderstanding.

647
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:28,400
Yeon Ok.

648
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,060
Why don't we...

649
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,630
talk face-to-face?

650
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,369
Why do you want to see me
face-to-face, you jerk?

651
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,670
When did you get infected?

652
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,940
Seung Beom gave me the drug.

653
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,079
I guess something was wrong with that.

654
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:50,020
Then you should have told me!

655
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:54,020
Then you wouldn't have let me stay.

656
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,790
I tried so hard to hold myself back.

657
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:01,389
I tried drinking my own blood.

658
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:04,329
But that wasn't helpful.

659
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:09,400
Gosh, come on.

660
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,310
I only got thirstier.

661
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:19,650
This is tough on me too!

662
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,750
Should I...

663
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,579
just go downstairs to the gym too?

664
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:35,529
Woo Chang, you and I
have been through a lot together.

665
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:38,060
If people find out that you are infected,

666
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,630
becoming the apartment representative
will be difficult.

667
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,040
Are you going to give up everything
just like that?

668
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,040
Then what should we do?

669
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,940
Go inside your room.
Then I'll bring you food.

670
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:54,509
Let's say that you're sick.

671
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,880
Just hold out for a few days.
Then the soldiers will be here.

672
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,420
You can hold out until then.
You can do that, right?

673
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Honey.

674
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,590
Woo Chang.

675
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,759
Woo Chang!

676
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,650
Are you home?

677
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:38,020
Should we break down the door?

678
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,529
Hey. Calm down.

679
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,829
If I get hotheaded,
you're supposed to calm me down.

680
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,400
Sometimes, we should switch roles.

681
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,969
Ms. Oh!

682
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,449
The reverend is inside, right?

683
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:02,849
No.

684
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,949
He went outside.

685
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,219
He's really not inside?

686
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:43,090
Reverend, I would like to pray...

687
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,810
What are you doing here?

688
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:18,590
There were a few things
I forgot to go over.

689
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:19,889
And it's hot today...

690
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,599
Oh no.

691
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,903
Hey. The reverend...

692
00:45:58,312 --> 00:45:59,312
Hey!

693
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:05,923
Wouldn't my blood be tastier?

694
00:46:59,872 --> 00:47:01,303
I need you to apply the ointment again.

695
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:04,872
Let's go.

696
00:47:22,062 --> 00:47:23,263
When they smell blood,

697
00:47:23,662 --> 00:47:24,932
the onset of the disease is stronger.

698
00:47:25,763 --> 00:47:27,332
Go inside when he calms down.

699
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:31,002
Has your idea about the infected...

700
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:32,702
changed now?

701
00:49:21,613 --> 00:49:23,452
You killed him.

702
00:49:27,122 --> 00:49:28,323
You did this.

703
00:50:27,243 --> 00:50:28,713
Were you here the whole time?

704
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,952
I thought there were infected people outside.

705
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:35,022
So...

706
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:36,452
was the situation handled?

707
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:00,783
You must've been scared.

708
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:03,752
I should've protected you.

709
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:06,122
You're going to do that from now on.

710
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:07,852
I trust you.

711
00:51:09,053 --> 00:51:11,093
Oh Ju Hyung was with that reverend.

712
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:12,562
He might've contracted the disease.

713
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:14,792
What should I do?

714
00:51:15,193 --> 00:51:17,162
I can't even stay at your place.

715
00:51:17,562 --> 00:51:18,602
Gosh...

716
00:51:18,763 --> 00:51:21,033
I'll talk to my wife.

717
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:22,173
No.

718
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:24,303
She'll figure out our relationship.

719
00:51:24,973 --> 00:51:26,102
But still...

720
00:51:28,772 --> 00:51:31,443
I told you Oh Ju Hyung's bankruptcy is a lie.

721
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:33,443
He invested everything in cryptocurrency.

722
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:34,783
If we find out that passcode,

723
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:36,752
all of that money is ours.

724
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:41,852
Okay?

725
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:56,973
Where were you?

726
00:51:57,872 --> 00:51:59,903
Did you know that the man on the 12th floor died?

727
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:02,243
I did. I was so surprised,

728
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:04,142
so I went to the roof for some air.

729
00:52:04,343 --> 00:52:05,412
The roof?

730
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,312
Lee Bo Ram is there.

731
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:08,542
Right.

732
00:52:08,613 --> 00:52:10,412
I sat in front of the door for a bit.

733
00:52:10,482 --> 00:52:12,423
Imagine how surprised I was to do that.

734
00:52:12,482 --> 00:52:16,053
His eyes suddenly turned white...

735
00:52:16,892 --> 00:52:18,863
You should've seen it.

736
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:21,263
By the way...

737
00:52:21,323 --> 00:52:23,932
Let's say, for example,

738
00:52:23,993 --> 00:52:26,602
you have an important passcode.

739
00:52:26,763 --> 00:52:29,332
It's long and complicated.
Nobody can know where it is.

740
00:52:29,403 --> 00:52:30,573
If you had something like that,

741
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:32,502
where would you hide it?

742
00:52:33,843 --> 00:52:35,102
I would memorize it.

743
00:52:35,173 --> 00:52:37,513
Or write it down somewhere
where nobody can find it.

744
00:52:38,412 --> 00:52:39,642
So that only I can find it.

745
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,082
Are you thirsty?
You're not feeling sick, are you?

746
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:18,082
Did you wash your hair
when we don't even have water?

747
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,122
What choice did I have?
I felt itchy and gross.

748
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:21,783
Don't worry.

749
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:23,653
We're going to get water soon.

750
00:53:36,332 --> 00:53:38,033
Don't do this ever again.

751
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:39,943
We don't even have antibiotics.

752
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:43,513
I'm the human vitamin and the human antibiotic.

753
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:44,642
I'll be fine.

754
00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:56,252
The reverend on the 12th floor...

755
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:58,593
That wasn't our fault.

756
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:00,493
I know.

757
00:54:03,232 --> 00:54:04,662
But I don't feel good about it.

758
00:54:06,162 --> 00:54:07,633
He should've told us he was sick.

759
00:54:10,673 --> 00:54:12,943
It's hard to admit
that you've contracted the disease.

760
00:54:14,102 --> 00:54:17,372
I'm sure he was afraid of
the urges he felt to bite people.

761
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:21,883
I'm sure he thought that...

762
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:25,553
if he endured it a little more,
they'd come up with a cure.

763
00:54:27,323 --> 00:54:28,952
He was probably afraid that...

764
00:54:30,452 --> 00:54:32,162
the person closest to him
would be afraid of him.

765
00:54:32,223 --> 00:54:33,493
That would've been hard too.

766
00:54:39,562 --> 00:54:40,702
What is it?

767
00:54:40,963 --> 00:54:42,133
Do I have a fever?

768
00:54:43,473 --> 00:54:44,633
You're incredible.

769
00:54:46,303 --> 00:54:47,542
We have fever reducers in the room, right?

770
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,912
Take some just in case,

771
00:54:50,812 --> 00:54:52,642
and let's take a break tomorrow.
Let's not do anything.

772
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:55,082
Good night.

773
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:56,982
Good night.

774
00:55:00,482 --> 00:55:01,582
Am I okay?

775
00:55:04,653 --> 00:55:05,763
Hurry up and go to bed.

776
00:56:29,173 --> 00:56:30,312
Honey.

777
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:07,883
We had no idea.

778
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:09,482
How could that be?

779
00:57:09,982 --> 00:57:12,352
We heard the reverend on the 12th floor
was infected.

780
00:57:12,823 --> 00:57:15,622
He's dead. Please pray for his soul.

781
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:18,452
The couple duped us completely.

782
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,963
I think you two should keep order around here.

783
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:22,193
You came here to say that?

784
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:24,633
That, and to ask for water.

785
00:57:24,693 --> 00:57:27,363
You know we're all short on water, right?

786
00:57:27,562 --> 00:57:30,133
We saw that you had quite a lot.

787
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:33,002
- You want some?
- Yes.

788
00:57:33,073 --> 00:57:34,542
It's you and the guy on the 15th floor.

789
00:57:34,843 --> 00:57:36,772
The others went to the 15th floor.

790
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,443
We went to the rooftop,

791
00:57:39,513 --> 00:57:41,912
and the girl said she didn't need water.

792
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:43,312
She gave us this.

793
00:57:43,383 --> 00:57:45,053
You didn't hurt her, did you?

794
00:57:45,923 --> 00:57:48,383
Why would we touch her?

795
00:57:48,452 --> 00:57:49,952
The infected are really scary.

796
00:57:50,852 --> 00:57:54,622
This is water from the 15th floor, right?

797
00:57:54,693 --> 00:57:57,133
He has a lot, doesn't he?

798
00:57:59,263 --> 00:58:00,602
He does.

799
00:58:01,202 --> 00:58:02,732
We should ask him first.

800
00:58:02,803 --> 00:58:04,602
We should've gone there first.

801
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:11,973
When will it rain?

802
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,042
What?

803
00:58:13,843 --> 00:58:15,082
I don't feel anything.

804
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:18,482
Do you think...

805
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:21,682
we should share our water?

806
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:25,252
We can manage, but what about Seo Yoon?

807
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:27,593
What about the 15th-floor guy?

808
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,263
The others went to him to ask for water.

809
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:32,763
Can you open the door?

810
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:35,033
- We...
- Oh, my gosh.

811
00:58:35,102 --> 00:58:36,102
Hello.

812
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,932
- What's this about?
- You have water, right?

813
00:58:39,002 --> 00:58:40,303
We're all struggling.

814
00:58:40,372 --> 00:58:41,372
Let's share.

815
00:58:41,443 --> 00:58:43,372
We can leave in a few days anyway.

816
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:44,912
What if we can't?

817
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:46,613
I'll pay you for what you have.

818
00:58:46,682 --> 00:58:50,482
The cleaner couple wants 200 dollars
for 500ml of water.

819
00:58:50,553 --> 00:58:52,522
That's way more expensive than oil.

820
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:54,383
Then you can sell what you have too.

821
00:58:54,752 --> 00:58:57,022
Guys, let me talk to him.

822
00:58:57,093 --> 00:58:58,223
- You can go.
- But...

823
00:58:58,392 --> 00:58:59,763
This won't solve anything.

824
00:58:59,823 --> 00:59:02,122
Residents should help each other out.

825
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:04,133
- He could need legal advice.
- Hello.

826
00:59:04,193 --> 00:59:06,202
You know the doctor on the sixth floor
has a temper.

827
00:59:06,263 --> 00:59:07,463
He could start a fire.

828
00:59:07,533 --> 00:59:09,602
Why would you say that when I'm right here?

829
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:10,932
- Calm down.
- Let's talk.

830
00:59:22,013 --> 00:59:23,082
Talk.

831
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:26,223
I apologize.

832
00:59:27,223 --> 00:59:29,252
I keep asking for help.

833
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:31,223
Since they know,

834
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:33,463
how about you share if you have enough?

835
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:36,533
Just a little. They won't need much.

836
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:41,102
You don't have to,

837
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:42,573
but think about it.

838
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:44,633
If it gets too tough,

839
00:59:44,702 --> 00:59:46,502
we'll go outside and get more.

840
00:59:46,602 --> 00:59:48,473
You don't have to go outside.

841
00:59:49,443 --> 00:59:50,542
Building 103.

842
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:54,713
In the Electric Room under the senior citizen center,

843
00:59:54,783 --> 00:59:56,352
there's an emergency switch-over called EPS.

844
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:59,182
It's there to control the lights and elevators
during emergencies.

845
00:59:59,582 --> 01:00:01,153
If you power that up,

846
01:00:02,053 --> 01:00:04,423
power and water will come back on.

847
01:00:04,493 --> 01:00:07,593
But it runs on a diesel generator.

848
01:00:08,223 --> 01:00:09,963
It will make a massive noise.

849
01:00:10,033 --> 01:00:12,432
The noise will attract the infected.

850
01:00:13,202 --> 01:00:14,702
We'll talk about it.

851
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:18,133
Tomorrow.

852
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,142
In the morning.

853
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:25,743
I'll pick out what I think I can hand out.

854
01:00:27,482 --> 01:00:28,783
You'll share some stuff?

855
01:00:30,182 --> 01:00:32,653
- Great. You'll be blessed.
- Thank you.

856
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,622
You'll be blessed.

857
01:00:38,352 --> 01:00:40,693
- I don't get why...
- I know.

858
01:00:41,693 --> 01:00:43,062
Will he give us some water?

859
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:45,903
What about some other stuff?
It looks like he has lots of food.

860
01:00:45,963 --> 01:00:48,162
It's common courtesy to give us some water.

861
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:50,602
Tell him to share with us.

862
01:00:50,673 --> 01:00:51,932
Calm down.

863
01:00:52,332 --> 01:00:54,473
We'll give you a bit of what we have.

864
01:00:54,673 --> 01:00:57,613
Unit 1501 will think about it until tomorrow.

865
01:00:57,812 --> 01:00:58,973
Don't bother him.

866
01:01:00,013 --> 01:01:01,883
- Let's all go downstairs.
- He will share, right?

867
01:01:01,943 --> 01:01:03,752
- Will he change his mind?
- Let's go.

868
01:01:03,812 --> 01:01:04,852
Leave him alone.

869
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:07,323
- What if he changes his mind?
- Let's go.

870
01:01:07,383 --> 01:01:08,383
That's enough.

871
01:01:11,093 --> 01:01:12,622
Still nothing from Han Tae Seok?

872
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:16,033
No. I guess he'll call when he wants to.

873
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:19,763
- What are you looking for?
- Well...

874
01:01:23,102 --> 01:01:24,102
This.

875
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:26,973
I got it when I trained
with the FBI's Quick Reaction Force.

876
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,642
It's a large.

877
01:01:31,173 --> 01:01:32,243
What is this for?

878
01:01:32,312 --> 01:01:34,883
I want to thank the guy on the 15th floor.

879
01:01:34,943 --> 01:01:37,153
He grumbles, but he does what we ask.

880
01:01:37,213 --> 01:01:40,182
I have a T-shirt from the Italian Championships.

881
01:01:40,252 --> 01:01:42,452
- Shall I bring that?
- No, you keep that.

882
01:01:45,053 --> 01:01:47,223
(Wonjung University Student Dormitories)

883
01:01:59,243 --> 01:02:00,272
Honey.

884
01:02:00,502 --> 01:02:02,613
Yes, Young In. I'm here.

885
01:02:04,243 --> 01:02:06,312
Everything feels like a dream.

886
01:02:07,912 --> 01:02:10,653
I think I'll be at home when I wake up.

887
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:16,792
How is our Wriggly?

888
01:02:26,963 --> 01:02:27,963
Wriggly's fine.

889
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:29,272
Honey.

890
01:02:32,033 --> 01:02:35,343
Can't we take out Wriggly first?

891
01:02:38,412 --> 01:02:40,412
It might come out infected.

892
01:02:40,482 --> 01:02:42,213
Because it shares your blood.

893
01:02:44,713 --> 01:02:46,522
- Honey.
- Yes?

894
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:50,452
Our Wriggly.

895
01:02:52,723 --> 01:02:55,423
Don't give up on Wriggly, okay?

896
01:02:56,392 --> 01:02:57,392
I won't.

897
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:09,133
We can't...

898
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:11,803
postpone the birth any longer.

899
01:04:13,502 --> 01:04:15,343
You must make the call.

900
01:04:15,403 --> 01:04:17,243
I'd have had the baby aborted if I could.

901
01:04:17,973 --> 01:04:20,383
Young In is unstable
and if the baby's taken out,

902
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:22,682
her condition could worsen.

903
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:27,852
You still have to choose.

904
01:04:29,223 --> 01:04:31,223
If you can save only one,

905
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:32,593
who will it be?

906
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:36,993
I have only one option.

907
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:42,903
Sae Bom's blood panel is back.

908
01:04:43,633 --> 01:04:44,973
She has antibodies.

909
01:05:09,662 --> 01:05:10,732
See you later.

910
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:11,792
Shall I come with you?

911
01:05:12,332 --> 01:05:15,232
No. He gets antsy when you're around.

912
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:17,403
That's how shy people are.

913
01:05:17,473 --> 01:05:18,573
I won't be long.

914
01:05:19,803 --> 01:05:20,903
Stay safe.

915
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:43,093
Jung Yi Hyun.

916
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:52,062
I'm listening.

917
01:07:05,112 --> 01:07:09,883
=Happiness=

918
01:07:26,662 --> 01:07:29,633
What is the mistake you can't fix?

919
01:07:29,973 --> 01:07:32,832
We ran background checks
on the people in the apartment.

920
01:07:33,072 --> 01:07:34,303
And we found something odd.

921
01:07:34,673 --> 01:07:35,942
Was Mr. Kim Se Hoon really behind it?

922
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:38,042
A resident died.

923
01:07:38,173 --> 01:07:40,013
That's not important right now.

924
01:07:40,082 --> 01:07:41,782
Our food is gone.

925
01:07:41,843 --> 01:07:42,952
How dangerous is it?

926
01:07:43,013 --> 01:07:44,183
Tell the infiltration unit to be on standby.

927
01:07:44,813 --> 01:07:45,952
Please help Sae Bom,

928
01:07:46,223 --> 01:07:47,952
so she can be safe.

929
01:07:50,593 --> 01:07:52,192
This will be my last favour to you.

930
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:54,223
Yi Hyun!
