(All child actors were accompanied by a guardian, )

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.750
(and filmed in accordance with labour laws.)

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.420
Yes. The students are thrilled with the merger.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.889
We spent all the funds on the students...

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.820
to renovate the facilities.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.960
Is that right?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160
In this 4th Industrial Revolution, with you, Mr. Vice Minister... No...

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.370
You're practically the next Deputy Prime Minister.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.870
Please, you shouldn't say such things.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.570
If the ministry would foster our interdisciplinary talents here...

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.940
with your supportive administration, it would be a tremendous help.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.550
Like King Sejong took the scientist, Jang Yeong Sil, under his wing.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.780
Well, you're one to talk, Dean.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090
Aren't you practically the next president?

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.060
Oh, my. I have no interest in that whatsoever.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.229
I'm just focused on a better future...

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.760
for our students at Hangang University.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.630
That's all I ever think about.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.380
With a single merger

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.950
I pulled in a fat stack of cash

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.950
The head of the remodelling company is the commissioner's second cousin

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.060
It's all your tuition money anyway

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.060
A textbook case of embezzlement

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.130
It's the start of the foundation's all-in-one scheme

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.440
- My goodness! - The man has no shame.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.280
Guys, Emergency Committee, huddle up!

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.110
Look at this statue they slapped together

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.880
- This thing cost millions? - That's ridiculous

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.760
We have to teach them a lesson

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.060
Actually, kids these days

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.900
They side with the establishment

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.500
Just shout louder

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.710

- Resign! Resign! - Resign! Resign!

- The classrooms lost to the merger! - Give them back! Give them back!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.460
The profits from the Gangwon Campus that kicked out students!

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.590
- Whose pockets are they lining? - Whose pockets are they lining?

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.270
I think the students have been misinformed.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.200
- Corrupt Hangang Foundation! - Shut it down! Shut it down!

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.910
- Step down! Step down! - Step down! Step down!

We'll analyse biometrics live, and for speech patterns and content,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.920
we'll process those with a daily batch analysis.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.160
- The location... - Wait. This is for couples, right?

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.960
You guys are in danger. You're about to break up. Code red.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.030
Like this?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.700
You can't do it like that. You have to be more heartfelt.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.410
Your pitch has to move people.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.340
- Like what? - Like what?

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.980
I wonder when it started.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.810
When the laughter between us faded away.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.680
When we stopped looking into each other's eyes.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.690
When being together just meant staring at our own phones.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.790
The man who was once so close to me now feels a million miles away.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.920
That's when you need Split Alarm.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.530
Oh, brother.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.130
Got an email.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.030
We passed.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.070
- Yes! - We worked so hard for this.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.240
Hey, if Min Hak posts about this, this thing will blow up, right?

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.280
To start, we'll get way more testers than any other team.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.540
And you know what that means.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.110
It means we're going to get hit with a crazy number of unexpected bugs.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.950
Yes. So we can kiss sleep goodbye until after the pitch.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.090
I haven't slept in three days. What do you mean by that?

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.920
Anyway, let's go home for now.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.130
- What? No celebratory drinks? - Let's shower first.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.130
We all really stink.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.560
I'll stay on standby in case the server crashes.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.970
And something's been bugging me that I want to fix.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.770
No way. What if you mess with it now and it just makes things worse?

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.210
I'll run it on my own server, so don't worry about it.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.040
Fine. Just go home.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.440
Would it be awkward to ask Min Hak, considering the circumstances?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.150
Yes, probably.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.720
(Billions Invested Based on an AI-Generated Celebrity Face)

(Massive Deepfake Scam)

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.350
You really had no idea? I heard you even met with them.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.260
The voice was identical.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.100
But looking back, how they moved was a little inhuman.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.230
Apparently, it had six fingers.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.240
What about that script they sent us? The one they said was top secret?

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.100
What about all the lines we rehearsed?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.170
They said the whole thing was written by ChatGPT.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.040
Oh, no.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.110
Your brother must have taken a hit if he invested in it too.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.950
- He said it wasn't much, but still. - Oh, my.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.520
I had no idea, and I bragged to everyone about it.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.020
I even bought so many people dinner to celebrate.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.260
I enjoyed the meal.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.170
I'm just kidding. But I'll keep practising my acting.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.570
You got this!

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.310
So Kim Eun Kang showed up. And then at, like, four?

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.570
We ended up drinking until like four-thirty.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.150
- A dating show? Again? - This one's different, Amor Fati.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.990
Contestants gather on a closed set and secretly have a party...

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
I told you I'm taking acting seriously.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.270
That Director Bong thing...

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.170
Even though that Director Bong movie fell through,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.040
I'm going to keep learning, and take any role, even a bit part.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.080
My coach even said he'd look for opportunities for me.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.450
So I hear. Finding an acting coach on your own,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.350
are you looking into other agencies?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.119
And I heard you told our clients...

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.720
to send the schedule to you directly?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.030
You're really drawing a line in the sand with me.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.290
I can't do the dating show.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.730
- I'm not doing it. - Why not?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.030
I'm seeing someone.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.470
Joo Yeon San?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.840
Okay, whatever, I get it.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.220
Dating shows are for good daters. Why would a loser at dating join?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.750
But this is part of your job, so she'll have to understand that.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.690
I didn't expect you to be happy, but hoped for "good luck" at least.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.160
What if paparazzi begin following you like they did Jinny?

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.400
It's even harder on a civilian like Joo Yeon San.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.200
I'm just looking out for you and thinking ahead.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.270
That wouldn't be a problem if you weren't acting like the paps.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.540
What?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.010
The person who took those pictures of me and Jinny.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.010
That was you.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.920
It seemed weird when I thought about it.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.520
That day, I just said I was going to meet a friend,

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.920
but you kept fussing over what I was wearing.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.630
When I saw your car in the lot on the day of the Commercial Shoot,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.830
I remembered seeing it in front of the hotel that night.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.170
The license plate...

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.540
was the last four digits of our old home phone number,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.210
so it stuck in my head.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.580
So what?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.150
Did I extort money from you? Did I sell them to some reporter?

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.450
I took pictures to negotiate with Jinny's team for your career.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.220
Everyone in this business schemes like this to survive.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.160
You're so naive you get ripped off left and right like a total sucker,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.460
and I'm the one protecting you from it.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.560
Wow.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.300
Fine. And I've lied to you about a lot of other things too.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.310
The mist commercial and all those other sponsorships we had,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.670
when I said we were dropping them because they were beneath you now,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.110
that was a lie. We didn't drop them. We got dropped.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.950
This is where you're at right now.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.120
This is no time to be casually shooting some short film.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.250
Season Three of Match on Wheels is about to come out.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.990
You know that guy from your school, Hun Gyu, is the new Catfish, right?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.990
He's taller and younger than you.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.460
- Hun Gyu? - More new faces will keep coming.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.530
We've got debts to pay off,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.569
and in this industry full of vultures,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.870
who else but me do you think will have your back right now?

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.870
Those contracts I never even knew about,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.280
the houses in my name that I don't even live in.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.510
The money I always sent my siblings suddenly stopping.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.920
Come on, you're not even blood-related.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.360
Still, I saw you as a brother, so I stayed quiet.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.530
I really relied on you, too.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.260
- Min Hak, Min Hak, I can explain... - But...

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.400
I'm done with this.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.350
Here you go, President.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.780
Thank you.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.620
- The Science and Lit depts merged. - What the heck?

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.960
What's wrong? What is it?

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.430
(Hangang University. This is their equipment.)

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.360
I have this spare laptop...

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.299
I bought in Yongsan to use for a server.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.530
This is our school's property.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.840
It wasn't formatted right, so I opened it and found a lot of stuff.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.970
Can you believe their security is this lax?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.380
Wait, you brought your laptop on our first date?

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.679
The dataset got bigger, so I ran a distributed learning model,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.190
but I think something got messed up, so I'm trying to fix it.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.419
Now I'm unemployed and you're busy.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.660
Is that why our Split Alarm score rose?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.490
"Love Storm Warning" issued.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.930
A "Love Storm Warning?" Isn't that a bit much?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.830
This Split Alarm app is totally useless.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.900
Just hurry up and run the tests.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.870
No, I'm not running a test! We're supposed to be on a date!

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.110
Anyway, I'll be there soon.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.150
But we were just on the phone, and he's getting closer.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.150
What on earth could be the problem?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.850
Maybe it's getting more errors because it's using real data now?

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.920
Could couples who talk a lot be trying to avoid a breakup?

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.990
What is this nonsense?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320
Yes? What's up?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
Min Hak,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.920
I know you don't want to take my call right now.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.359
And that you don't want to take...

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.759
- the job I offered you. - Jae Hak.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.700
You don't have to do this with me. You can go solo or use another firm.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.500
But this is too good an opportunity to pass up.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.870
I got a call from Hangang Group.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.100
Look, even I didn't see this coming.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.150
Have you thought about what I said?

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.250
(Park Chang Yi Thought about it?)

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.120
You know Oh Seung Hak, our senior from class 20?

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.420
He won gold at the Physics Olympiad, so his picture is hanging at school.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720
Right.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.030
He just got a faculty position at Carnegie Mellon,

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.530
and he's recruiting grad students for his lab.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.860
I'm going to be joining him.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700
Oh.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.039
- Come with me. - What?

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.540
Undergrads can apply as assistants, and a visiting student program, too.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.080
The field is a perfect fit for you. I'll put in a good word.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.540
I don't know.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.450
- It's just so sudden. - Think back to high school.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.720
I know we were just talking about pipe dreams back then,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.390
but what we talked about is similar to the Deep Seek Model, isn't it?

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.420
It's an industry that's blowing up.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.990
Yeon San,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.960
if you really want to grow, you have to make a decision now.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.660
Why are you going to such lengths for me?

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.670
Is it concern for my future, find Na Rae's novel interesting,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.770
and want to help Dong Won?

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.440
- Then why? - Because you've been on my mind.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.450
But you ignored me when I actually needed your help.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.260
- What are you talking about? - The URP Project at KAIST.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.830
There was a rumour going around school back then.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.230
That some young high schooler was holding back a promising senior.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.040
That I was just the motel owner's daughter.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.640
I must be easy.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.780
I was just working hard because I was genuinely enjoying it,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.950
but the rumour was I was being clingy and making you uncomfortable.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.120
What are you talking about? That's ridiculous!

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.350
I even begged you for help, but you just refused.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.060
- What? It wasn't me. I had no idea. - That's...

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.160
what your girlfriend told me.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.860
Not that I even knew you had a girlfriend.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.140
When you suddenly dropped out, I assumed something had happened,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.210
but I never imagined it was this.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.710
My girlfriend? I have an idea who you mean,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.250
but Bok Gil wasn't my girlfriend. She just wanted to be.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.950
I...

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.020
I had feelings for you, Yeon San.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.760
So you've been avoiding me because of that misunderstanding?

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.230
It's true I want to help Na Rae and Dong Won.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.530
They're great friends giving you comfort and strength.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.400
But they're both finding their way and doing fine.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.600
What about you, Yeon San?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.970
What about your future?

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.240
You need to get back on the right track.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.650
I'll help you.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.490
You're here.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.960
What were you so lost in thought about?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.530
It could be an issue with the hyperparameter settings.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.640
What I mean is, our dataset is much larger now.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.310
But the model's training parameters are still the same.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.310
So the system is...

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.880
Come on. No shop talk today.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.220
You picked a no-Wi-Fi spot on purpose, didn't you?

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.660
No. This is that park Na Rae was talking about.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.200
It won Korea's Landscape Grand Prize and a national education award.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.600
It's spacious and not too crowded, so it's nice and quiet.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.510
You've been lugging this heavy thing around all day?

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.050
Your shoulders must be so sore.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.380
It's not that heavy.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.190
Seriously? You're carrying two laptops?

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.520
I need them for different things, okay?

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.690
What's that?

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.630
My...

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.330
Hey!

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.330
(Exposing Hangang Uni. Corruption)

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400
How's this?

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.370
No, a little higher up. That part, a little to the right.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.310
- To the right? - No, left, left.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.840
- Just stick it on already. - A little to the right, and...

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.280
- This looks good enough. - Stick that on, too.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.280
- I'm sticking it here. - Stick it there. Go on, stick it.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.080
You're all working so hard this early in the morning.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.250
- Yoo Ri. What brings you here? - Hello.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.160
I ordered some snacks, but I couldn't carry them all alone.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.430
- Snacks? - Did she say snacks?

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.390
Thank you!

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.270
Here, let me get that.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.880
- How did you get here at this hour? - In a taxi.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.580
That's not what I meant.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.720
You're not on the Emergency Committee anymore.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.890
But it's for the sake of justice. You could say it's my thing.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.860
The Sailor Moon way.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.490
So you're a Sailor Moon fan?

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.760
I'm more of a Mars.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.870
Really? I get told I'm like Mars a lot.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:11.840
I can see that.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.210
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.480
My family is close to some pretty powerful people.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.810
Wow.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.480
I don't know if we can date with such a class divide.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.120
I thought you enjoyed breaking down barriers like that.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.100
You know what I like, don't you?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.030
And this too, right?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.680
What are you doing this weekend?

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.280
I was planning on meeting you.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.280
What do you want to do for fun?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.020
I think anything would be fun with you.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880
Let's get started.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.150
It's 4am already?

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.160
The over fitting issue is more or less solved,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.460
and the file for Kang Dong Won is uploaded.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.170
Breakup Advisory. A breakup is imminent.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.970
(San and Min Hak: Day 42 Breakup Advisory)

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.310
But what the heck is the problem?

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.450
(Hangang University)

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.930
Did you see this? What's going on?

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.200
What? Someone spray-painted all over the Jang Yeong Sil bust.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.999
Did someone hold a gun to their heads...

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.630
and force them to come here instead of Seoul?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.439
Im Yoo Ri used family connections to get in?

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.040
How can someone disabled model?

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.710
I know, right? Gosh.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.040
What's this about?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.180
- A certified letter? - For property and facility damage.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.520
But who the heck vandalized the bust?

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.120
It wasn't us. Right?

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.950
On the CCTV footage, it looks exactly like we did it.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.260
We have a local media interview, so we should post this online...

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.200
Actually, this is perfect. Let's blow this wide open!

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.560
Dong Won, rather than that...

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.270
What? Right, we can join forces with the other departments...

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.870
and stage a real protest. Let's get the president impeached.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.940
Let's be honest.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.109
Hangang University isn't a top school.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.240
Who's going to pay attention to us?

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.249
Look. Honestly, I was just in it for the scholarships...

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.350
or getting the classroom situation fixed.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.820
I honestly had no idea it would blow up like this.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.390
Wait, hold on. Guys, this is exactly what they want.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.530
For us to fall apart. They released misleading CCTV.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.070
I'm sorry, but I'm out. The legal complaint, the damages...

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.800
It's too scary. I can't do this anymore.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.300
I'm really sorry, guys.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.710
Hey!

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.910
If I get disciplined,

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.920
my job offer might be rescinded. I've already been hired.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.020
You do? Congratulations.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.890
I'm so sorry.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.730
Can't have that offer rescinded.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.140
Hello, ex-Treasurer.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.390
- Mom. - Where are you?

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.620
- Where do you think? At school... - Do you know what just arrived?

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.630
Yes, Mom. The school's gone crazy. My friends and I were framed, so...

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.560
Are you with that girl right now?

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.400
- What? - Come home this instant.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:11.970
Mom.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.970
I know what you've been up to and who you've been seeing.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.810
I let it go when you were yourself, hanging out with friends again.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.110
But I can't stand by and watch you do this nonsense, seeing some girl.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.150
Besides, your father's on edge with his hearing coming up...

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.500
What the...

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.500
Why do you guys have matching tumblers?

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.870
This one's mine. It's water, and this one's coffee.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.210
Hey, Joo Yeon San. I heard everything from Chang Yi.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.510
What? What are you talking about?

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.180
I asked about the Yes Lab meeting, so I messaged him privately.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.220
Why aren't you reading my texts? Sorry, unless the meeting is urgent.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.220
So are you really dating Chang Yi?

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.890
What are you talking about?

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.430
You are not?

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.660
I heard Chang Yi asked you to join his lab at Carnegie Mellon.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.170
He just suggested it, that's all.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.970
Why would you even think about it? It's a great chance, you have to go.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.010
Hey, why talk about my business here when nothing's even decided?

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.480
Don't you have a filter?

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680
Sorry.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.320
It just sounded like good news, so I wanted to congratulate you.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.120
Forget it. I have my reasons...

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.360
It's just a personal matter, that's all.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.960
So that's what was going on.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.360
It's not a done deal.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.730
I just said I'd think it over.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.300
Hey.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.840
You're annoyed with me, but so sweet to Min Hak.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.970
- What? - Right. Even with such worries,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.710
I forgot you keep to yourself. I guess I was the one overreacting.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.920
- Hey. - But are we even really friends?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.590
We know so little about each other and have to find out from others?

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.990
And what about you two?

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.830
Do you even care about what I'm doing?

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.660
What?

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.730
Joo Yeon San.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.800
Didn't you say Chang Yi refused to help us commercialize our app?

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.210
What?

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:30.810
Yes.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.580
According to him, you're the one who turned it down.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.650
There was a misunderstanding between us back then.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.090
But wait, you contacted him too?

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.420
Why?

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.790
I'd like to ask you the same thing. No, why did you?

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.990
You could've at least asked us before deciding on your own.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.760
- You're planning to study abroad? - No, I said I haven't decided yet.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.970
I contacted Chang Yi to ask him to help us again.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.510
You're all too busy studying and having fun...

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.310
to notice what's been going on at school.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.309
- Was that last part about me? - If the shoe fits,

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.010
- then it was probably about you. - Hey!

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.890
If I'm disciplined, I can't compete. Now I must fight the school head-on.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.760
This is a research project. If that gets out, we lose our funds.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.930
I was worried the contest would be cancelled because of me.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.729
I felt bad about wasting your hard work,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.230
so I had to at least ask for his help.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.370
But why am I even worried?

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.410
You're all doing a fine job of looking out for yourselves.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:41.210
- Off to the Discipline Committee. - Hey.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.250
Hey, why are you being disciplined? What's going on?

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.590
What was it we were going to say at our pitch?

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.160
Our app can predict breakup signs to stop people from drifting apart?

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.660
Looking at us now, I'd say our app is already a failure, wouldn't you?

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.460
Hey, Kang Dong Won, wait a minute.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.130
Hey, wait up.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.170
Hey!

(Team Miracle Call)

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.240
Here's what I think.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.710
The department merger was a result of the school's financial crisis...

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.950
and declining student numbers, making it an unavoidable choice.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.450
Wasn't it the best decision to improve the students' education?

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.820
To the protesting students, if you truly care about everyone,

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.430
instead of attacking the school during a financial crisis,

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.860
shouldn't we find a way to overcome this together?

Rather than pushing your selfish agenda and hurting other students.
