[Episode 18]

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.140
Tomorrow, you two brothers

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.479
will carry thorny branches on your backs

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.680
and come with me
to the Tea Merchants' Association.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680
Perhaps Mr. Hou Er

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.759
will let it go.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.789
-That's right.
-Yeah.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:48.640
Will you do it?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.590
No.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.580
Why should I?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.400
I'm not going.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.800
If you don't go, who will?

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.710
Listen here,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.640
you two

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.780
can't keep causing trouble like this!

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.150
The beating you got last time
wasn't enough for you,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.640
was it?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700
Just look at him.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.800
Fine.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.210
I can carry those thorny branches,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.210
and I can admit my mistakes.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.230
As long as it's good for our village,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.310
even if Hou Er

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.490
slaps me a few times,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.950
it's worth it.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.079
But let me ask you all—

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.800
then what?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.520
It's not like I

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.310
carried his child and jumped into a well,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.110
so why would he hate me this much?

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.990
He just wants to force down

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.240
the price of my tea.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.329
If, at this moment,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.800
I go bow and scrape to him,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.730
he'll use the chance

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.310
to push down the price of all the tea

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.910
in the village even further.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.590
So what about the tea you have now?

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.850
Will you sell it or not?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.280
Will you sell it or not?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.910
He's trying to slash the price.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.040
Will you sell or not?

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.880
Today, my brother and I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.150
went through every tea shop

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.000
in town.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.190
Right now, top-grade Silver Bud

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.250
sells for 3.3 strings of coins per jin

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.150
on the market.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.780
-That high?
-That high?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.910
-So high!
-Yeah.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.800
Second-grade

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.490
sells for 2 strings.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.280
Even the third-grade Silver Bud

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.070
can sell for 1.7 strings.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.410
1.7 strings?

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.590
-That's so high.
-Exactly.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.390
But that Hou Er

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.840
simply offers

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.510
only 1.3 strings

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.190
for my best tea leaves.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.750
And the price difference

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.630
will all go

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.170
straight into his pocket.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.840
Are we here every day

working so hard, growing tea,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.240
breaking our backs without rest,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.100
just to make that Hou fellow rich?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.940
-Hou Er is really despicable!
-Exactly!

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.100
Next time he comes to the village,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.630
we should beat him to death!

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.910
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.079
Enough, enough!

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.079
Gu,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.380
stop saying those useless things.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.880
Just tell us what we should do now.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.680
It's not like tea merchants
across the country

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.840
have all died out.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.190

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.720
Is it the government?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.760
Does it hold absolute power?

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.610
Our Anhui tea has major clients

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.890

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.510
in Inner Mongolia,

and in the Northwest.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.560
I can handle
all those distribution channels myself.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.620
But at this moment,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.580
I hope you can trust me

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.880
and stand together through this.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.450
This isn't about trust.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.230

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.980
That's right.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.850
win first place no matter what.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.680
Everyone,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.560
please sit, sit.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.870
-Sit. Sit.
-Let's sit.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.330
You've probably all heard.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.490
The late Emperor

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.680
passed away in Rehe.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.040
The capital has new rulers now.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.360
The former Noble Consort Yi

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.950
and the Sixth Prince
jointly oversee state affairs.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.680
The new reign title is Tongzhi.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.160
"Tongzhi"

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.810
means the ruler and ministers
governing together,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.270
and also brother-in-law and sister-in-law
ruling together.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.770
That's good, that's good.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.310
I'm not just making small talk here.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.390
Nominally, the Grand Tea Competition

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.720
is hosted by our family,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.789
but the one actually tasting
and judging the tea

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.330
is the Sixth Prince.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.090
The Sixth...

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.039
That isn't just a tea gathering.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.390
It's business.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.810
Your Anhui tea wants to win first place.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.640
Then, what about Yunnan tea

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.530
and Taiwan tea?

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.360
There are many subtleties involved.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.440
Old Master Hu.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.750
What is it?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.210
There's a

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.150
young tea merchant outside.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.030
He sent his calling card,

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.430
saying he wants to meet
with the Tea Merchants' Association.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.470
This person is too arrogant.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.550
It's clearly the Silver Bud,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.910
and he has the nerve
to call it Orchid Snow.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.030
Send him away. I won't see him.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.720
Orchid Snow tea—

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.030
that's quite a lovely name.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.910
Come on, let me take a look

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.970
and see who this is.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.730
No manners whatsoever.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.680
What kind of person is this?

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.810
An old acquaintance of yours.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.720
[To Old Master Hu, head of
Anhui Tea Merchants' Association]

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.400
[Greetings from Gu Pingyuan]

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.650
Old Master Hu says

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.960
he's too busy to see you.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.270
He's discussing business with guests.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:40.670
Here.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.010
Your card is returned.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.120
Please leave.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.260
Who are the guests?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.610
Gu!

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.150
Mr. Li Qin.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.180
I knew it.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.260
You must be the one.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.390
Alright, let's not talk here.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:53.920
Let's go.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.840
How did you manage

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.390
to offend that Hu fellow

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.120
right after arriving in Anhui?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.270
That old man's brain is stuck in the mud.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.870
As if he'd ever look kindly
on someone like you.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.330
Listen to me on this.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.810
I'll find a chance.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.880
I'll think of a way to smooth things over

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.010
between you and him.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.570
You came

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.830
with your father this time, didn't you?

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.050
Back in Shanxi,

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.520
I offended him terribly.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.530
Counting on him to help me now?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.320
Forget it.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.910
True enough.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.030
Well then,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.600
I know some

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.830
local tea merchants.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.590
I'll pay out of my own pocket

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.630
to have them buy

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.400
all your tea.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.560
Anyway, I won't let you lose money.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.330
Just hearing you say that,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.080
I'm deeply grateful.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.360
[Orchid Snow]

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.440
It's only that the Orchid Snow tea of mine

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.900
is like a timeless beauty.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.970
If it only mingles among common,

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.360
[Orchid Snow]

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.670
vulgar teas,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.200
I think that would be too much of a waste.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.930
[Orchid Snow]

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.080
Let me try.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.630
Orchid Snow.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.390
What do you think?

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.690
Truly like a stunning beauty.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.360
You indeed are a kindred spirit,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.890
willing to speak the truth.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.780
But what's the use?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.960
The tea merchants in Beijing

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.290
all listen to my father.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.080
And you've offended

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.580
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association here.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.500
Such fine tea—what a pity.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.540
Or sell it to the Mongolians.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.630
I've already offended

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.960
all the Mongolians too.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.910
Wait,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.340
why do you cause chaos

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.850
wherever you go?

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.310
You think I want to?

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.520
I'm just a tea farmer now.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.390
My whole family depends on me

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.900
selling tea to put food on the table.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.120
Those bloodsucking tea buyers

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.930
push the prices so low.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.260
What am I supposed to do?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.780
Just let them bully me?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.920
I think you've reached a dead end.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.750
I've come to realize—

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.670
maybe in this life

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.240
I'm destined to end up at a dead end.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.370
I'm used to it by now.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.550
That Grand Tea Competition

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.880
your family is hosting—

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.880
could my Orchid Snow tea

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.170
win the championship?

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.470
Sure it could.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.120
Orchid Snow tea takes the crown,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.360
and then you pass the Imperial Exam
to become top scholar—

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.900
parade through town on horseback
and rise to high office.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:25.750
You're having

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.000
quite a sweet daydream here.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.870
Do you want me to kick you

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:28.890
into the lake?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.420
You're always mocking me.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.420
But honestly,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.270
if you really want to attend

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.330
our family's Grand Tea Competition,

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.670
I can find a way

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.440
to get you in.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.380
But after that,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.930
you are on your own.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.290
I'm at a dead end anyway.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.440
What's there to fear?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.770
I'm counting on you now.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.510
Father.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.970
Where did you get it?

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.240
Father,

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.080
this is the Orchid Snow tea.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.410
How kind of you.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.480
Willing to put in a good word for him.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.670
This might even be better

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.240
than the top-grade Silver Bud tea.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.840
I think there's
real business potential here.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.060
I think

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.480
that old man Hu

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.630
is being too overbearing.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.550
Such good tea—

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.370
just because it doesn't suit his taste,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.120
he rejects it without a second thought.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.940
If you ask me,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.460
if we could have

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.510
this Orchid Snow tea

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.200
for sale in our own tea shops

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200
every year,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.610
wouldn't that be...

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.840
You've been

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.510
paying close attention
to the family business lately.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.240
That's good.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.360
Such excellent tea—

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.120
if we have exclusive rights to sell it,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.320
it'd be wonderful.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.220
But it's Gu Pingyuan's tea,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.490
which changes everything.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.440
Why is that?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.240
Let me ask you—

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.630
if we buy his Orchid Snow tea,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.030
what would happen to him?

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.930
I doubt that Hu fellow

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.690
would dare to fall out with you.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.750
We can just buy it.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.810
Would he dare offend our Li family?

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.670
You have a point,

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.640
but he would harbor resentment

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.860
because we made him lose face.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.640
If our competitors

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.150
chose this moment to approach him,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.680
we'd lose him immediately.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.750
Our years of business relationship

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.550
would be gone.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.790
Besides, his tea

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.590
has limited annual production.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.190
With our hundreds of stores,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.360
could we really rely on the tea alone

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.760
to sustain our business?

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.690
Even if none of those issues existed,

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.200
by doing this,

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.370
wouldn't I be encouraging

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.010
people like Gu Pingyuan

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.720
who seek attention

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.790
and emboldening such young people?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.870
One day,

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.790
would he demand to share

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.390
the profits with us equally?

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.870
Or would he simply

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.620
take everything and sell it,

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.080
no longer working with us?

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.550
It's just like

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.720
Xiang Yu meeting the First Emperor of Qin

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.380
and wanting to take his place.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.800
It's very possible.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.380
Ambition, you see...

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.030
It's like

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.080
a fire in one's heart.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.430
Easy to ignite,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.530
but hard to extinguish.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.030
In this world,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.430
rules always come first.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.590
And what are "rules"?

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.960
I am the father,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.000
and you are the son.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.390
When I meet guests while seated,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.850
you must remain standing.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.930
If even this cannot be upheld,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.800
what business is there to do?

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.480
Remember this:

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.330
even the finest herbs must be removed
when they block the path.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.510
I've already instructed every merchant

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.600
in the capital

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.320
not to buy Gu Pingyuan's tea.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.150
And you—don't play tricks behind my back.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.980
If I find out,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080
I won't spare you.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.450
How did you get back so quickly?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.109
Next time, could you please
assign me tasks

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.569
that a human being
can actually accomplish?

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.069
The things you make me do—

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.440
what kind of tasks are these?

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.790
I'm just not capable of
doing them for you.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.490
I didn't get a single coin!

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.410
There's boiled water inside.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.200
You're drinking raw water like this—

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.020
aren't you afraid of getting diarrhea?

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.070
If I die from diarrhea,

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.470
I'll finally have peace.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.000
All the way back here,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.110
I've been so worried.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.830
You've already made those big promises,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.640
and soon everyone in the village

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.350
will bring their tea

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.550
with their palms up, asking for money.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.160
Won't that drive us to our graves?

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.480
Mother's legs aren't what they used to be,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.830
and she'll have to flee with us by then.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.560
How pitiful.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.640
Did you get to

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.440
see Madam Jin or not?

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.110
I didn't even catch

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.240
a glimpse of that Madam Jin

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.100
you mentioned.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.550
I handed in your note,

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.510
and they said Madam Jin

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.740
went out of town to check on some...

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.740
some branch shop,

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.950
and they don't know when she'll be back.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.070
Good grief.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.920
We might be able to wait,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.350
but the tea can't wait!

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.450
Besides,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.180
with that scrap of paper you wrote,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.680
and you're asking for
50,000 or 60,000 taels—

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.960
why should they lend you money?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.690
Can you please smarten up a bit?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.200
Hey, you're really getting into

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.800
scolding me now, aren't you?

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.160
I won't say anything more.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.310
I'm thick-skinned anyway.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.440
My life is worthless.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.420
Tomorrow I'll go apologize
with thorny branches on my back.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.330
Drink some boiled water

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.330
and wash your feet before sleeping!

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.400
If I ever listen to you again,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.660
I'm a complete donkey.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:35.950
[Silver Bud]

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:36.880
Put them inside.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.040
All right.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.630
Okay.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.790
Put it here.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.440
Okay.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.400
Careful.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.080
Zhu Laosan,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.200
you're the craftiest one here.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.480
Don't you short me on the weight.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:46.920
I won't, I won't.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.660
Come on, come on.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.810
[Silver Bud]

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.140
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.130
I'm taking it to your home.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:57.870
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.110
Put the tea here.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.640
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.900
Where's your brother?

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.640
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.510
Okay, okay.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.330
Mrs. Gu.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.310
Having your meal?

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.730
Would you like to join us?

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.920
I'll pass, but thanks.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.960
Now that the tea is sold,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.070
half the weight on my heart

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.190
is lifted.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.040
That's better than any meal.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.920
Right?

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.640
Right.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.090
Um...

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.560
I have a cousin
who lives at the foot of the mountain.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.050
He's got some good tea too.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.030
You think we brothers

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.630
are rich suckers, don't you?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.260
Your cousin's tea?

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.190
What about your uncle's tea?

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.470
You want

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.160
my uncle's tea too?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.820
We want all your family's tea!

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.580
This kid...

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.210
How can you speak like that?

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.080
We'll buy it.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.410
Spread the word—

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.250
besides tea from our village,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.540
I'll take tea from other villages too.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.640
But there's one condition:

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.270
I'll only buy first-grade tea.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.510
Second or third grade—forget it.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.770
For all the tea I purchase,

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.190
I'll still add 10% to the price.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.590
In the next couple of days,
I'll have Pingwen

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.670
bring the money to you

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.080
so you can have peace of mind.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:19:59.690
Really?

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.000
Then I'll tell everyone just that.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.400
Thanks!

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.090
Thank you, Mrs. Gu.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:09.880
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.210
Thank you, Mr. Pingwen.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.940
I'll take my leave now.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.000
Mother.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.400
We have a hen at home.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.720
Let's kill it and stew it.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.820
It's doing so well.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.830
Didn't you want to keep it for eggs?

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.510
Eggs?

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.920
We can't even afford to
eat an egg anymore.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.790
Haven't you heard? We're finished.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.000
My brother is dragging you and me

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.200
straight to our doom.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.850
What are you two brothers talking about?

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.110
You didn't see it.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.290
A few days ago,

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.070
my brother got kicked in the head

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.760
by a donkey.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.790
He bought all the tea in the village

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:48.720
and laid it all outside.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.440
If you had seen it,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.480
you couldn't eat right now.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.000
You shouldn't talk about
your brother like that.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.790
No manners.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.030
Pingyuan.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:56.850
What are you doing?

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.440
You heard him.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.210
I just bought a batch of tea.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.310
I opened

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.100
a tea shop for Pingwen in town.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.720
We've got to
have something to sell, right?

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.480
Enough, enough.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.080
Wipe that grin off your face.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.110
You think you're rich like Li Million

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.560
with houses, land,

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.880
and mountains of gold and silver?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.810
What are you using to pay everyone?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.880
Those thorny branches from last time—

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.830
Pingyuan, put them on my back.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.130
I'll crawl into town.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.480
If I die halfway there, leave me there!

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.740
I might as well be dead!

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.480
Is Mr. Gu home?

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.050
We don't want any more tea!

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.890
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:29.620
Madam Jin,

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.850
what brings you here?

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.030
Madam Jin?

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.470
So you're Madam Jin.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.070
This is your younger brother, right?

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.240
Unfortunately, that day

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.640
I happened to be at our Datong branch.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.030
They told me your brother had visited.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.920
He didn't get to eat

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.750
or even have tea.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.830
I couldn't bear the thought of that.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.030
So I hurried over to apologize.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.900
I'm sorry.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:46.640
No need for that, really.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:46.880
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.340
Madam Jin, please come in.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:50.960
Mother!

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.460
Mother,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.580
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.240
this is my friend from Shanxi.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.590
Greetings, Old Madam Gu.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.010
I wish you good health.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.400
Get up now, get up now.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.210
Please come with me inside for tea.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.070
Old Madam Gu,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.610
let me help you inside so we can talk.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.310
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.430
My husband and the others

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.240
send their regards.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.030
I've also brought all the gifts

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.910
they sent.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.170
Come in quickly!

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.000
-Yes, Madam.
-Yes, Madam.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.650
Come on.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.660
Pingyuan,

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.770
are those gifts real?

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.170
You don't believe it?

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.240
Open the boxes and see for yourself.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.540
Madam Jin,

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.330
I really owe you one this time.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.260
Mr. Gu,

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.880
the untamed spirit you display outside

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.520
is kept in check at home, eh?

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.060
It's quite interesting to see.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.440
After all, you are

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.700
our Association Head!

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.190
That's all made up.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.170
This boy...

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.690
What Association Head
are you talking about?

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.110
Let me explain to you, Old Madam Gu.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.880
Mr. Gu

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.090
is the leader of our Shanxi

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.640
Draft Bank Merchants' Association.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.550
Among the 3,000 draft banks in Shanxi,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.200
just one note from Mr. Gu

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.550
and everyone will obey.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.880
Speaking of which, Association Head,
I should

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.680
apologize for arriving a day late.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.200
No need for such formalities.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.680
Mother,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.580
Madam Jin is just teasing me.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.650
I have something to discuss

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.200
with Madam Jin in private.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.800
All right.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.110
Our guest has come from afar,

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.910
so you must take good care of her.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.920
We're country folk with simple manners.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.780
Please don't mind, Madam Jin.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.930
I don't deserve such courtesy,
Old Madam Gu.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.590
Please excuse us for a moment.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:27.660
Madam Jin, you don't have to

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.190
come all this way yourself.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.290
When I left Shanxi,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.150
I made it clear.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.110
There would be no such thing

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.270
as an association head anymore.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.600
Please stop teasing me.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.270
Mr. Gu, you can live here

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.910
and still be so calm about it.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.900
You truly are a great hero.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.790
Those who offended you

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.270
must be blind.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.880
I'm just a tea farmer now.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.080
Anyone can offend me.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.170
But you, Madam Jin,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.550
coming all this way
in your esteemed position—

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.080
I feel truly sorry about it.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.770
That's where you're wrong.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.300
With our friendship,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.070
Mr. Gu,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.000
even across thousands of miles,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.730
I must come to you immediately.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.000
My husband is in poor health

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.200
and not fit to travel.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.840
If I didn't come personally,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.480
I simply couldn't be at ease.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.750
To avoid any inconvenience in using it,

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.440
I've exchanged everything

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.550
for banknotes from the Four Major Banks
in the capital—

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.310
10,000 taels each,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.310
20 notes in total.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.480
Redeemable in hard silver.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.880
I hope it's enough.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.110
I can't possibly use that much.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.500
If you can't use it all, just save it.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.450
My husband said

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:25.940
it's rare for you to ask for help,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.870
so we're more than happy to assist.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.030
A small Anhui Tea Merchants' Association

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.790
dares to stand in your way?

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:33.550
They must have

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.250
lost their minds completely.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.720
Just say the word,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.920
and we can buy up all the tea

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.780
in Anhui province. It's nothing.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.640
Anyway, Mr. Li is in the tea business.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.300
He has plenty of connections.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.800
I'm just a tea farmer now,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.830
trying to prove a point to the villagers.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:48.680
I don't want to make

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.010
such a big fuss about it.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.020
Anyway,

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.750
here I must

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.060
thank you, Madam Jin.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.870
All right,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.680
I'll follow your instructions.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.400
If there's nothing else,

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.640
I'll take my leave now.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.960
The marketplace is like a battlefield—

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.490
no moment should be wasted.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.350
Leaving so soon?

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.720
Won't you stay for a meal?

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.590
You think I came to Anhui

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.440
just for you?

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.670
I heard Hefei will be recaptured soon.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:07.870
All along my journey,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.000
I've been checking when we can

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.460
open a branch office here.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.270
Mr. Gu,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.440
you have your way of doing business,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.750
and I have mine.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.540
Mr. Gu,

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.350
no need to see me out further.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.040
She's as capable as any man.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.280
It's only right.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.880
Be more careful.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.570
Listen, everyone—

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.880
all the tea

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.260
should be stored separately
according to grade.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.960
If this warehouse isn't big enough,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.180
we can rent another one!

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.090
My brother said

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.010
that for anyone bringing tea,

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.570
as long as it's top-grade,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.970
we should pay

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.350
10% more
than the Tea Merchants' Association!

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.830
Understand?

00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:59.490
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.090
Mr. Pingwen, the boat has been rented.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.110
Please go check it out.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.240
Let's go take a look.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.180
[Ping]

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.490
[Orchid]

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:18.590
Look.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.270
[Orchid Snow]

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.330
How's the writing?

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.480
Pingyuan,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.140
you really have time
for such refined pursuits.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.510
I heard that the Grand Tea Competition

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.000
doesn't allow individual participants.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.030
Only provincial
tea merchants' associations can attend.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.710
Rookies like us—

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.060
will we be allowed?

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.200
In this world, you have to take risks.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.240
What?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.520
Without them,

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.880
we have no path forward?

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.210
But aren't there rules?

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.110
Rules?

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.690
They set the rules.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.400
Those rules only benefit themselves.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.640
I have my own rules.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.740
Not for myself,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.110
but for this Orchid Snow tea,

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.770
I must fight for recognition.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.270
Such a treasure

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.510
going unappreciated in this world—

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.200
wouldn't that be a crime in itself?

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:01.880
By the way,

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.530
arrange for someone

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.960
to take care of our mother.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.690
After lunch,

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.270
we'll set off for the capital.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:07.810
Really?

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.580
The marketplace is like a battlefield.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.160
Some matters

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.750
are as urgent as a raging fire.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.280
Delay even a moment,
and you'll answer for it.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.060
Why are you still up so late?

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.820
Have a sip?

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:49.110
[Orchid Snow]

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.130
I don't want any.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.010
I'm completely wiped out.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.700
We're almost at the Shandong border.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.430
I originally thought that this time,

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.080
I could live a peaceful life

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.130
and take good care of our mother at home.

with us.

I'd like to taste this tea.

Orchid Snow tea...

That's a nice name.

Is that a man or a woman I was arguing with?

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.590
Why do people in the capital sound

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.550
so androgynous?

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.310
Androgynous?

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.880
Looks like a eunuch to me.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.400
Keep your mouth shut once we get inside.

to start with

we're participants
in the Grand Tea Competition.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.710
If you stop us,

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.230
you can't afford the consequences
of delaying us.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.960
You may have gotten through the main gate,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.690
but do you know how to get through
the second gate?

Officer,

we're country folk.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.510
We got through the main gate

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.030
with help from someone from our hometown.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.140
So, please tell us

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.550
how to get through the second gate.

5,000 taels?

For you two, 10,000 taels.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.150
And you must clearly state

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.920
which tea merchants' association
you belong to.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.320
I'll have to send someone

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.800
to get your association's head

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.880
to come and claim you.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.680
