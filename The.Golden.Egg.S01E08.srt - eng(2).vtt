WEBVTT

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.277
MARRIAGE MIXER

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:13.184
You're Ami Shirakawa?

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:15.987
Hinako Shinoda.

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:18.957
Is it okay if I tell Niko-chan your name?

00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:19.958
Yes.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.694
You'll probably be wearing name tags,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.963
so let's have her approach you.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.897
Okay.

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:28.266
That's pretty vague.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:29.934
Will this work out?

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.469
I'll let her know.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.372
You're Makiko Tanioka?

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:36.674
Yes.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.078
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:49.287
Ms. Tanioka? Ms. Makiko Tanioka?

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:52.824
You left your bag.

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:54.058
I'm so sorry!

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:17.749
The third victim is Makiko Tanioka,
age 28.

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:39.037
Could I ask you a question?

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:40.972
Sure.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.275
When did you get today's ticket?

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.311
In April.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.447
That's a while ago.

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:52.183
Every member does.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.552
It's so popular it fills up right away.

00:01:55.887 --> 00:01:56.854
I suppose so.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:58.523
Thank you.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:05.263
KUWABARA
GOOD LUCK

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:10.802
Right, I'm supposed to meet with
this anonymous Niko-chan.

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:14.472
What was their relationship
to the late Ms. Tanioka?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.342
A close friend, apparently.

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:21.679
Ms. Tanioka entrusted something
to Niko-chan before she died.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:26.117
My job is to meet them in person
to find out what.

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:30.188
Sounds like you got stuck
with another tough assignment.

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:33.224
It's like the epitome
of a Sengoku Weekly job.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:38.997
Well, I've been lying low
so nobody finds out I'm a reporter.

00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:42.800
What if the killer is watching
you right now, though?

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:45.036
Then I'd get killed next.

00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:47.338
I'll do my best.

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:49.507
Bye.

00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:54.445
Okay!

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:08.159
Niko-chan.

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:11.095
Niko-chan.

00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:17.969
They're taking so long.

00:03:18.503 --> 00:03:19.504
Niko-chan.

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:22.407
Where are you?

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:24.842
What do you look like?

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:31.416
What do I do? I can't just
wait here for them the whole time.

00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:35.486
I'll have them make an announcement!

00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:37.822
Wait, hold on.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.892
That would draw attention.

00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:45.496
"Niko-chan, please come
to the reception counter."

00:03:46.464 --> 00:03:48.499
What if a lot of people gather?

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:50.401
I don't know what they look like.

00:03:50.468 --> 00:03:51.803
That won't work.

00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.440
I can check everyone's name tags

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:58.543
and find someone who might
be called Niko-chan.

00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:02.880
Wait, nicknames aren't that simple.

00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:06.351
Maybe the nickname comes from their smile.

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:08.553
Do I need to make everyone smile then?

00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:11.155
I can't do that.

00:04:13.057 --> 00:04:16.127
I could pretend to call out to someone

00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:18.763
and just shout out "Niko-chan!"

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:24.569
No, it would suck if nobody answered.

00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:27.972
Everyone would look at me at once

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.009
and kick me out for acting crazy.

00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.313
What do I do?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.515
Niko-chan!

00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.421
The Incident Team is trying
to track down Kubozuka,

00:04:43.488 --> 00:04:45.990
but we're not having any luck.

00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:47.892
Just sent it.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:48.893
Thanks.

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:52.096
What's this?

00:04:53.464 --> 00:04:54.532
What photos are these?

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.434
It's an industry party.

00:04:56.501 --> 00:05:01.406
From stylists like me, to photographers,
designers, and aspiring models

00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:03.608
so I thought they could be useful.

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:05.710
These are great.

00:05:05.777 --> 00:05:06.644
Thanks.

00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:08.679
Also,

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:12.483
you have any connections
with Komiyama's family?

00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:14.919
No.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.422
Her parents have passed away,

00:05:17.488 --> 00:05:20.992
and her older sister died a few years ago,
leaving a son behind.

00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:22.527
And she was single.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.262
I see.

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:27.231
I thought it'd be helpful to meet them.

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:29.467
Okay. Thanks.

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:31.836
Wait, isn't today Hinako's thing?

00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:36.707
It is, isn't it?

00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:39.544
She hasn't checked in with me yet.

00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:42.480
I wonder how it's going.

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:47.985
Hey, you got a second?

00:05:48.052 --> 00:05:48.886
Sure.

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:53.925
I overheard you talking, you're a reporter
for the Sengoku Weekly, right?

00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:57.895
Are you staking out a celebrity
or something?

00:05:57.962 --> 00:05:59.497
I'm not doing that.

00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:03.367
Sorry, but I hate the Sengoku Weekly.

00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:06.971
You guys ended my favorite idol's career.

00:06:07.572 --> 00:06:08.840
How about that?

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:10.174
-That's not…
-What?

00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.477
You're a tabloid reporter.

00:06:13.044 --> 00:06:16.347
I don't know what your deal is,
but I'm looking for a husband.

00:06:16.414 --> 00:06:17.748
You need to leave.

00:06:19.016 --> 00:06:22.253
I'm telling reception
there's a tabloid reporter here.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.654
Please wait!

00:06:24.222 --> 00:06:26.290
This is payback for ending my idol.

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:31.162
I'm not the type of reporter
after some gossip.

00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:36.367
I just work for Sengokusha's free PR zine.

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:40.137
So that's the type of lie that you tell?

00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:41.272
I have proof!

00:06:41.873 --> 00:06:44.308
Sengokusha puts out more
than just a tabloid.

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:47.845
We publish interviews like this too.

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:54.185
I'm just here as a woman
who works at a publisher.

00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:55.753
Not for an assignment!

00:06:58.956 --> 00:07:00.992
I'm glad you understand.

00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:05.463
Ms. Shinoda?

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.364
Yes!

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.334
So your name is Hinako Shinoda.

00:07:12.136 --> 00:07:13.838
Who's Makiko Tanioka then?

00:07:14.972 --> 00:07:19.877
That reminds me, it did seem like
you didn't buy your own ticket.

00:07:19.944 --> 00:07:21.879
I got it from a friend.

00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:24.448
Yeah?

00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:29.153
Makiko Tanioka is the same name
as a victim of those suspicious deaths.

00:07:29.854 --> 00:07:30.755
Don't tell me.

00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:34.025
That's the deal then?

00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:38.863
You used a murder victim's ticket
to investigate a crime?

00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:40.898
You suck!

00:07:41.432 --> 00:07:43.801
You think tabloids
can do whatever they want?

00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:47.705
You're on the wrong path as a human
for using a dead woman's name tag.

00:07:48.773 --> 00:07:51.309
Could you not tell people I'm a reporter?

00:07:52.343 --> 00:07:54.378
I bet you're numb to it already.

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:57.915
You're a piece of trash with no empathy.

00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:15.700
Stop looking at your watch.

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:21.405
I mean, Tanioka's case
hinges on Ms. Shinoda right now.

00:08:26.344 --> 00:08:27.211
Excuse me.

00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:29.447
I got some new info.

00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:33.284
The place where Harue Komiyama
and Kubozuka met

00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:35.052
was a cave bar in Akasaka.

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:36.487
A cave bar?

00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:40.658
The concept is that it's cool in summer
and warm in winter.

00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:42.259
Where'd you get this info?

00:08:42.326 --> 00:08:45.129
I got a tentative ID match
from the bartender.

00:08:45.196 --> 00:08:46.030
Got it.

00:08:46.097 --> 00:08:48.299
-Keep going in this direction.
-Okay.

00:09:02.413 --> 00:09:03.247
Hello.

00:09:04.015 --> 00:09:05.650
Hello, Hinako?

00:09:06.517 --> 00:09:07.418
What is it?

00:09:08.252 --> 00:09:09.620
Are you at the office?

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:13.324
I'm at Palazzo Ducale AZABU for work.

00:09:13.391 --> 00:09:18.663
Wait, I was there last week
for a hula dance lesson.

00:09:19.697 --> 00:09:21.766
You came all the way from Chiba? Sorry!

00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:25.770
A famous instructor came
to teach a lesson, so I joined.

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:29.874
It's hard to keep up
if you're not regularly exercising.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.509
My legs were jelly.

00:09:31.575 --> 00:09:36.447
The instructor said "That's not
hula dancing, that's dizzy dancing!"

00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:39.316
The whole class was cracking up.

00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:42.653
Hello?

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.688
You listening?

00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:44.922
Yeah, I am.

00:09:45.423 --> 00:09:47.158
So, what did you want?

00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:50.895
Your dad and I are coming to Tokyo
and wanted to grab dinner.

00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:53.898
Okay, let me know
when you pick a date.

00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:57.902
What are you doing there anyway?

00:09:57.968 --> 00:10:00.805
You're not on another stakeout, are you?

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:01.972
It's not a stakeout.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.208
I'm investigating undercover.

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:08.279
What? An undercover investigation?!

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:11.082
Get it together, Hinako!

00:10:11.148 --> 00:10:13.751
You're working for a publisher!

00:10:13.818 --> 00:10:18.355
Only Tom Cruise and Jack Bauer
are allowed to go undercover.

00:10:18.422 --> 00:10:20.958
You're a young woman.

00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:23.327
Another weird analogy?

00:10:24.028 --> 00:10:25.229
But I get it.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.031
I'll be fine.

00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:29.633
Thanks for the call.

00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:33.104
Anyway, I gotta get back to work.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.110
Just call me back later.

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:40.411
I will.

00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:41.345
Bye.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.326
LET'S TALK
COME TO THE CHAPEL

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.595
It's from Niko-chan!

00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:24.688
You wrote this note?

00:11:26.123 --> 00:11:27.858
I'm sorry for the theatrics.

00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:30.928
I just assume Niko-chan was a--

00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:36.167
I just have some visual impairments
that makes me sensitive to light.

00:11:36.934 --> 00:11:39.570
Would it be okay
if I kept my sunglasses on?

00:11:39.637 --> 00:11:41.472
Yes, of course.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:46.310
Am I right to assume your ticket
was originally Ms. Tanioka's?

00:11:46.377 --> 00:11:47.745
That's what I was told.

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:54.051
Have you been entrusted with something
other than the ticket?

00:11:54.118 --> 00:11:55.920
I thought that was you.

00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:58.889
If you have an envelope, could I see it?

00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:00.391
An envelope?

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:04.361
It's just a regular envelope.

00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:06.764
Sorry.

00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:07.731
One second.

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:10.668
Hello?

00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:13.871
You're Hinako Shinoda?

00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:16.307
Yes, that's me.

00:12:16.373 --> 00:12:17.241
Who is it?

00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:18.976
I don't know.

00:12:19.043 --> 00:12:21.145
But I think it's a man.

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:22.146
Is someone there?

00:12:22.213 --> 00:12:23.647
Could I see the envelope?

00:12:23.714 --> 00:12:24.882
One second.

00:12:25.816 --> 00:12:26.750
Hello?

00:12:27.384 --> 00:12:28.886
Where are you right now?

00:12:28.953 --> 00:12:30.454
The yard? The main hall?

00:12:30.955 --> 00:12:32.690
Um, so who am I speaking to?

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:35.926
Does Niko-chan ring a bell?

00:12:37.161 --> 00:12:38.028
Huh?

00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:40.331
-What?!
-Give me the envelope, now!

00:12:40.397 --> 00:12:41.832
What are you doing?

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:43.033
Are you okay?

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.401
Stop it!

00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:46.337
Tell me where you are now!

00:12:46.403 --> 00:12:47.238
Is this it?

00:12:47.304 --> 00:12:48.606
Second floor, the chapel!

00:12:48.672 --> 00:12:50.074
I'll be taking this.

00:13:05.556 --> 00:13:07.024
We're heading downstairs.

00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:14.565
You said you were visually impaired!

00:13:26.443 --> 00:13:27.278
He's gone.

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:30.614
Where are you?

00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:36.754
Oh. I think I found you.

00:13:42.026 --> 00:13:45.129
Are you Ms. Shinoda?

00:13:46.964 --> 00:13:48.299
Are you Niko-chan?

00:13:53.704 --> 00:13:56.440
Tanioka and I have been friends
since we were teenagers.

00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:00.244
She had a rough upbringing.

00:14:01.278 --> 00:14:05.149
She would constantly say
how she would marry someone rich.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.253
She's the one who found this party
and got tickets for us.

00:14:10.254 --> 00:14:12.022
I came to fill the doctor quota.

00:14:13.624 --> 00:14:15.192
DENTIST
NIKO-CHAN

00:14:18.562 --> 00:14:22.599
I was looking forward to today
because I like pretty women.

00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:28.472
But then that happened to Tanioka.

00:14:30.774 --> 00:14:33.978
You received her ticket
right before she died, right?

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:38.682
She told me she didn't need it anymore.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.484
She didn't need it?

00:14:44.488 --> 00:14:46.757
She said she found the perfect mark.

00:14:48.058 --> 00:14:50.995
That she won't need to suck up to
rich old men anymore

00:14:51.061 --> 00:14:54.264
because she could collect hush money.

00:14:56.633 --> 00:14:58.869
I think she found out someone's secret.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.773
And then blackmailed them, but…

00:15:07.378 --> 00:15:09.246
I should've tried to stop her.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.887
But she entrusted you
with something then, didn't she?

00:15:17.955 --> 00:15:19.857
In case something happened to her?

00:15:25.763 --> 00:15:28.065
I just met a guy in sunglasses.

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:31.101
That man came to take it!

00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:32.536
Ow.

00:15:35.506 --> 00:15:36.340
What's wrong?

00:15:36.407 --> 00:15:37.341
Are you hurt?

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:38.776
I'm okay.

00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:45.182
But I'm glad you didn't run into
the sunglasses man.

00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:47.951
You would've been in danger
if he'd seen your face.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.424
Are you really a tabloid reporter?

00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:59.797
Your first instinct was my safety.

00:16:00.564 --> 00:16:03.167
Shouldn't it be to see
what Tanioka gave me?

00:16:20.384 --> 00:16:22.219
I can't believe it.

00:16:23.454 --> 00:16:26.623
I should have some compresses
at the clinic.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.659
Let's go get you patched up.

00:16:34.264 --> 00:16:35.499
FIRST-AID KIT

00:16:38.235 --> 00:16:39.103
So?

00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:40.637
I got it on.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:43.240
Thank you.

00:16:43.307 --> 00:16:46.877
Make sure to visit a clinic
if the pain doesn't go away.

00:16:46.944 --> 00:16:47.945
Okay.

00:16:48.011 --> 00:16:49.913
Be careful getting back home.

00:16:50.747 --> 00:16:54.084
Could you tell me about it?

00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:59.823
What did Ms. Tanioka entrust you with?

00:17:02.326 --> 00:17:03.894
You really want to know?

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:06.864
I do!

00:17:15.038 --> 00:17:18.142
What is it that you see with your eyes?

00:17:19.776 --> 00:17:23.213
A scoop, right? You want to know
for your article.

00:17:24.748 --> 00:17:29.820
The friends and family of the victims
are praying for the truth.

00:17:29.887 --> 00:17:31.855
The killer hasn't been caught yet.

00:17:32.723 --> 00:17:35.125
What can a gossip magazine do?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.095
While I don't trust the cops,

00:17:38.162 --> 00:17:40.898
tabloids are amateurs
without any authority.

00:17:40.964 --> 00:17:43.333
What exactly can you do
with the information?

00:17:49.573 --> 00:17:51.742
You think tabloids
can do whatever they want?

00:17:51.808 --> 00:17:55.045
You're a piece of trash with no empathy.

00:17:55.112 --> 00:17:58.248
Buzzing around human misery.
Only ever exposing their bad side.

00:17:58.315 --> 00:18:00.250
That's how you make a living.

00:18:00.317 --> 00:18:01.685
You're the worst.

00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:11.495
Yes, I work for a publisher.

00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:15.832
It's not my job to pretend to be
with the police and arrest criminals.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.371
My job is to see the truth about the world
with my own eyes and tell the readers!

00:18:21.438 --> 00:18:23.207
What truth about the world?

00:18:23.273 --> 00:18:26.276
Celebrities having affairs?
An underground idol's true nature?

00:18:26.343 --> 00:18:29.947
Nobody cares about that kind of truth.

00:18:30.547 --> 00:18:33.016
Swarming around people's misery,
what truth?

00:18:33.884 --> 00:18:34.985
You're right.

00:18:35.719 --> 00:18:38.889
I couldn't say anything the last time
this was pointed out.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.825
But there's one thing I know now.

00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:47.464
The Sengoku Weekly
will go after anyone equally!

00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:52.102
Even if the target is
a powerful politician, a popular athlete,

00:18:52.169 --> 00:18:54.271
or one of our sponsors!

00:18:55.205 --> 00:18:58.875
At the very least,
we don't just pick easy targets,

00:18:58.942 --> 00:19:01.445
we put out anything and everything!

00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:04.248
No matter what the circumstances are!

00:19:05.882 --> 00:19:09.586
That's why I think the Sengoku Weekly
might be able to do something

00:19:12.623 --> 00:19:14.324
to help bring to light

00:19:15.492 --> 00:19:19.596
the truth behind Ms. Tanioka's death!

00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:28.138
I'm sorry.

00:19:32.309 --> 00:19:33.243
Okay.

00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:38.749
I'll show you what she gave me.

00:19:40.484 --> 00:19:41.318
Huh?

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.058
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:50.661
Either way, we have to go hard and fast.

00:19:50.727 --> 00:19:53.630
There's a real person behind the words.

00:19:53.697 --> 00:19:56.433
Everyone who got in his way
met a tragic fate.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.036
There's a good chance
that's what got her killed.

00:19:59.102 --> 00:20:01.571
You mean all three are connected
to the case?

00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:04.041
