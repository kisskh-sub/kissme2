00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.840
[It's cold by the lake at night.]

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.560
[Come out, hurry!]

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.240
[Let's not go out.]

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.960
[Chop-chop!]

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.479
[I'm going stargazing right now.]

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.160
Suit yourself then.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.440
[There are bears out there.]

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.759
No, there aren't.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.120
[You're the biggest bear here.]

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.120
[I mean it!]

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.080
[They might attack...]

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.240
[Come back inside!]

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.000
Not half cold outside.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.600
Come on!

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.400
[There are raccoons!]

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.560
Get out here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.680
[Look.]

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.840
Move it.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.360
I don't want to drag you out.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.440
Come out, now!

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.520
Hey, you.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.440
Out.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.039
Out now.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.759
It's really nice.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.080
What am I doing that for?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.160
To take a break.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800
It was perfectly fine inside.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.960
Warm, isn't it?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.840
Thank you.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.200
Look at all these stars.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.320
Why being a hermit?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.400
Beautiful.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.520
Beautiful. Here.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.320
Clink.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.960
Cheers.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.000
See that?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.360
A plane.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
Not a plane.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.079
Planes have blinking lights.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.560
Must be a shooting star.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.160
What did you wish for?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.280
That you'd have less work to do,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.640
and make more money.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.079
As if.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.680
Hey, it's a wish. You never know.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.560
You make one.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.440
It's still there. Make a wish!

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.520
Three, two, one!

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.640
Done.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.360
What?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.080
I wished for...

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.000
world peace.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.120
No more wars.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.640
No more famine.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.600
For everyone to live in freedom,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.320
just like us.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.920
Carefree and content.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.760
I'll make another one.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.440
My last one was not

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.000
grand enough.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.680
Go ahead.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.560
What was that?

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.960
Not telling.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.800
Oh, come on, tell me.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.600
I'll tell you in ten years.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.320
If we...

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.600
were still together then.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.840
Of course we will.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.400
We'll be together for a hundred years.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.640
We'll be like two old turtles.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.960
I wish that ten years from now,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.520
same spot,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.720
we still sit side by side.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.840
We will.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.000
[Stop dawdling.]

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.600
[Coming!]

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.320
What are you doing?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.880
Just got a new bank card.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.840
Keeping a memento.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.240
It marks my journey

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.560
from zero fans to something.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.440
When I hit a million followers,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.880
and this card's balance

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.240
reaches a million,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.720
I'll post a pic side by side.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.240
Just imagine.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.640
By then,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.080
we'll buy a villa in Li Daoqi's

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.920
neighborhood.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.000
While they're

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.159
having tea over there,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.720
we'll be on our balcony opposite,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.520
grilling lobsters.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.400
The smell will drift over.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.200
If they want some,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.280
we'll share a little.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.520
Wouldn't that be great?

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.680
Dreamlike.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.040
We're not going back to Canada?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.040
Once we're rich,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.720
we can go anywhere we want.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.400
Everyone, help yourselves.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.240
Make yourself at home.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.440
Don't stand on ceremony.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.000
Take whatever you like.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.480
Here, have some milk tea.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.520
Help yourselves.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.120
There's cake too.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.680
Afternoon tea's on Ms. Zhang!

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.960
Thanks.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.880
You're welcome. You've all worked hard.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.560
[So who's the generous sponsor?]

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.400
Come take a break.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.159
Have something to eat.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.120
Is it Zhang Ran's treat?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.360
Miss... Ms. Qian.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.520
Ms. Liao.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.120
You both

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.120
joined the company at the same time.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.000
Ran's followers

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.159
have surpassed 100,000.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.280
And the first commercial deal

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.360
were sensational, right?

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.200
You should learn more from Ran.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.840
That's exaggerated.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.640
you're making me

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.520
feel awkward.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.640
So,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.200
nice being famous, huh?

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.280
Minor fame feels

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.080
quite nice indeed.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.080
As if all the knots of stress

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.240
have just loosened up.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.200
So you see, you should listen to me.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.920
You're starting over.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.200
You need to drop the act.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.160
Stop clinging to your past prestige.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.440
Got it.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.400
Is there, uh, something warmer?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.120
Mr. Lin.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.840
Have something sweet.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.000
This one is dairy-free.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.040
No rocks, better for your health.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.600
Good performance.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.080
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.840
I'll get back to you later.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.320
Ms. Qian.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.360
Shouldn't we assign Zhang Ran

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.800
an assistant?

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.040
Zhang Ran's workload

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.320
isn't at full capacity yet.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.200
Wouldn't it

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.000
be a bit premature?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.159
We can make an exception.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.760
It's just that recently,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.360
two assistants just resigned.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.600
I haven't hired new ones yet.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.520
Once I find some,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.680
I'll assign one to Ran.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.280
M... Mr. Lin,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.360
I know a young man

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.120
who's quite good.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.320
He used to be a tour guide.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.120
Honest and pretty sharp.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.040
If possible,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.320
I can have him send

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.200
a resume over.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.120
A known contact is good.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.640
More reliable.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.000
What do you think?

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.880
Okay.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.040
Alright, send me the materials later.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.080
Thank you.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.080
Have another one.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.480
I'm good.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.480
Covering all bases.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.400
Hi, Ran.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.000
Oh, it's you.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.320
Where's your ride?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.800
Still on the previous one.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.840
Mine, either.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.040
You okay?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.440
Ran,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.800
I heard you came to the office today

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.400
to sign the revenue-sharing agreement.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.120
Oh, that's just supplemental.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.840
The terms were agreed on earlier.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.440
That's great.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.400
It's starting to pay back at last.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.480
Not like me.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.920
I'm here to get scolded.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.240
Don't think like that.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.080
Everyone starts out like this.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.960
I went to borrow a venue once,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.800
ending up breaking

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.560
one of the cups.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.840
Had to pay over CNY 8,000 for it.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.240
The return wasn't

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.000
even enough to

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.960
cover a fraction of the cost.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.080
That's just how it is.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720
Shooting a video

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.960
costs that much?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.600
Yeah, it does.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.280
So things are

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.400
never plain sailing.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.000
But it'll get better. Don't sweat.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.040
How can I not worry?

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.880
I got another warning from Ms. Qian today.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.320
The company keeps signing new people.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.760
They give us

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.320
guidance and review

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.680
at the start.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680
But no hit

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.320
in three months?

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.400
You're out.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.159
She put it that bluntly?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.919
Ran, you've had viral hits.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.240
And "Little White Sail"

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.800
got over two million views.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.240
Those numbers beat the top streamer's.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.080
Of course you're not worried.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.040
Don't look at it that way.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.920
Just because I

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.880
have a hit now,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.120
doesn't mean I'm safe.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.680
We're in the same situation.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840
The company would drop me

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.680
if I can't keep up.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.640
Let me tell you,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.840
in our line of work,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.520
believing in yourself is crucial.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520
As for viral hits,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.280
a lot of it is just luck.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.120
Right?

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.360
How do you know

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.000
that tonight

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.320
you won't have a breakout hit?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.040
I'm serious.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.680
You can't just...

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.080
lose your nerve,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.960
before getting things done.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960
Promise me you won't.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.320
Unknit those brows,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.800
and then

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.160
good luck can find you.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.520
And beam a bit too.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.680
That's my girl.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.080
My car's here, I gotta go.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.480
Seriously, perk up a bit!

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.640
Thanks, Ran.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.200
I mean it.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.840
Don't chicken out. You can do this.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:46.800
Bye.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.960
Sorry.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.920
I'm almost there!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.880
I tried to cheer her up

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.800
and literally

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.200
sprinted 800 meters.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.920
That definitely counts as a good deed.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.600
Doesn't it?

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.920
Absolutely.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.160
This Ms. Liao is

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.000
too introverted.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.600
Can't look people in the eye.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.760
Always staring down, like this.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.200
Muttering under her breath.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.680
Her hands always on the

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.320
bag straps,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.240
fiddling all the time.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.440
Who knows what for.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.360
I give it a few days

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.760
before she rubs the straps off.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080
Our company's idea

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.040
is to train her as a

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.800
comedy prankster.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.240
A prankster?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.160
She'd need to really let loose.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.920
To put it bluntly,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.800
she needs to be shameless.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.040
Personality-wise,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.360
she isn't cut out for it.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.280
I doubt she'll make it.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.280
She's just beginning.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.440
With your kind of contract,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.880
is the term you sign for

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.760
really long?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.320
As long as you can glean

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.920
a decent number of fans within the term,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.640
the company will still value you, right?

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.840
So that's why I say,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.200
it starts out like this for everyone.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.000
You must persevere.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.920
You never know when

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.480
luck will strike.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.960
It comes when it comes.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.040
You know, back then,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.400
if you hadn't encouraged me,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.600
told me not to give up,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.520
would I be where I am today?

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.280
Would I be this successful?

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920
It was my duty.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.120
Encouraging your wife

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.240
is Article Two of

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.880
the Husband's Code.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.840
What's Article One?

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.040
Believing in your wife.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.520
Fu Yudong, you're pretty smooth now.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.560
What books have you been reading?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.360
Show them to me.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.480
Who needs books for life insights?

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.560
No wonder they say

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.920
life begins at forty for men.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.720
You're right in your prime now.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.720
I mean, you're highly educated,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.760
a returnee scholar,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.920
good-looking,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.880
easy-going and friendly,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.960
gentle and attentive...

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.720
Oh my god,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720
you have everything that

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.280
young girls love.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.840
No wonder they like

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.040
you middle-aged bunch.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.040
Who else would

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.200
take me except you?

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200
That girl at the bank today?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.880
Her eyes sparkled

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.960
at the sight of you.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.880
I saw it all.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.720
Got her WeChat, right?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.480
Come on,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.040
see for yourself.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.600
I respect people's privacy,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.320
No way.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.200
You have to check.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.360
I must clear my name.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.880
Not interested.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.400
Just want to make one thing clear:

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.680
if I'm the sun,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.680
you're the sunflower.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.520
Your focus stays on me,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.680
no looking elsewhere.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.240
Or I'll kick you to mom's room!

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.960
You know,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.160
you seem different now

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.640
compared to when we

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.440
were abroad.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.920
In what way?

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.040
Hard to put into words.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.080
Just...

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.600
never saw

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.560
this side of you.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.760
You seem more alive.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.120
Which version do you like better?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.800
Both are perfect.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.160
Hammer coming!

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.080
Pass me the phone.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.480
Here.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.120
It's my phone ringing!

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.240
Your hearing is terrible!

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.560
Should get that checked.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.800
Let me see that.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.800
Honey! My first paycheck.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.560
I actually made money!

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.840
This is my first real income!

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.600
Honey...

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.080
Book a nice restaurant now!

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.600
I'm inviting my mom and aunt now.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.440
Wow!

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320
I got paid!

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.440
How much?

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.960
I'm rich.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.480
How much?

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.600
Guess! I'm not telling.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.720
You guess! How many digits?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.480
Let's see...

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.640
Ones, tens, hundreds... ten-thousands?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.200
Too much?

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.080
Oh my god.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.160
Stop guessing.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.240
Just tell me

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.040
what you want.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.920
My treat.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.720
Right now.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.720
I want the absolute best...

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.920
[Dear viewers,]

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.400
[the secret to long life]

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.040
[is as follows:]

[plenty of sleep,]

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.120
[moderate exercise,]

[loads of veggies,]

[and most importantly—]

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.960
[put your mind at ease.]

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.560
[Spend time with loved ones,]

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.720
[and laugh often.]

[to aging.]

Why'd you turn it off?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.680
The game's on later.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.640
Health show's over.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720
Bedtime.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.400
It's so early!

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.960
It's 10:00 PM.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.600
Major breakthrough!

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.280
What?

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.240
The letter C.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.920
All the pieces have letters

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.640
on the back,

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.520
signaling their zones.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.320
Zone C pieces go together,

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.080
Pieces with B go to Zone B.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.480
So we should group

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.480
all the C's here?

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:47.800
Exactly.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.200
Let's sort them

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.040
by zone first.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.600
Wait, there's

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.840
an even bigger discovery.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.600
What is it?

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.560
Some pieces

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.040
aren't even from this puzzle!

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.600
Meaning we can never finish it.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.280
Look at this mouse.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.400
Stuck in this cage.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400
Must be depressed.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.200
They won't even move.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.600
Don't touch it!

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.920
What, venomous?

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.120
It might turn into

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.280
Splinter from Ninja Turtles

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.400
and beat you with a stick.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.200
For lab mice like this,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.880
what happens

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.200
to them afterwards?

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.360
How should I know?

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.440
Not my lab.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.120
Done here.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.760
Let's go.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.400
Bye!

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.080
We're off.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.040
What to eat?

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.520
Anything.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.760
Your choice.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.320
[Treat me to satay noodles.]

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.320
[There's a new place nearby.]

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:07.880
[Sure.]

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.160
[You suggested it, you pay.]

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.960
[I waited ages for you!]

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.920
[At least buy me dinner.]

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.680
[I'm broke.]

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.320
[Look at you! So cheap.]

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.880
Our philosophy:

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.040
from nature,

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.000
back to nature,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.200
become nature.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560
We protect

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.280
every Asian gene.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.880
We pooled the world's

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.960
top biology PhDs

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.080
and...

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.040
Uh...

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.200
What was that again?

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.600
Every inch of skin...

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.680
Every inch of skin

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.440
is treated with care,

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.000
designed specifically for Asian skin.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.960
Come on, buck up!

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.080
Excuse me,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.200
do you speak Mandarin?

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.440
I can.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.280
Quick question.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.400
Aren't suits required today?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.680
"Check the invocation?"

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.160
"Dress cole: Business catual."

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.000
Right.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.080
Your mastery

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.840
of Mandarin

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.040
is pretty much none, huh?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.240
I am speaking "Tangerine"!

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:58.960
I see.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.440
Alright.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.400
You're all top talent,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.280
so I'll be direct.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.440
See that mountain?

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.760
We started in

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.320
a rundown factory

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.520
at its base.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.680
You've all done your homework,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.720
so let's start simple.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.920
Quick warm-up.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.960
When was our brand

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.040
founded?

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.080
In 1991.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.040
1991.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.320
Correct.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.680
We started in 1991.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.360
Mr. Wang, you've prepared

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.600
thoroughly.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.240
And you're confident.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.080
Good.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.240
That's the practical attitude

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.360
and diligence

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.680
we're looking for.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.240
[Tide foragers!]

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.680
Bring back a big haul!

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.800
I'm here.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.200
No coral like you said.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.880
Just rocks.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.160
Why would I go in?

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.560
It's freezing!

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.400
Looks fine,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.280
but try it.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.560
Can't last a minute.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.200
Stings like icicles.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.040
I'm fine.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.680
Nothing to be upset about.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.840
I'm at peace.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.440
Don't take yourself

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.360
too seriously,

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.880
or others either.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.480
Really.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.320
Things that

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.200
bother you now

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.480
will be a joke

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480
years later.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.960
For real.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.600
What's that saying...

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.200
Thank you.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400
Gotta go.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.920
Wasn't there a dress code

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.240
on the notice?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.120
There was.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.680
Said

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.480
"business

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.400
casual",

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.440
and I thought,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.120
isn't this

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.040
what this is?

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.520
What I'm

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.280
wearing is casual too!

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.600
Then I showed up

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.640
and everyone's dressed

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.520
like they're here to

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.800
play golf.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.520
You know?

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.400
Tiger Woods types.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.000
All they need is a club.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.400
To think I

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.280
spent a whole day

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.040
in the flea market

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.080
for this outfit.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.240
Total waste.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.720
You'd kill to work in Hong Kong.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.680
Why?

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.760
Well...

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.680
It's just...

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.760
Don't feel impelled to tell me.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.200
No...

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.800
Really.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.680
No, it's not a secret.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.040
Just finding the words.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.520
I do want to.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.400
As a kid,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.520
I loved those

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.880
Hong Kong business dramas.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.760
Those shows

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.840
got me obsessed.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.240
I always wanted

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.160
to be

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.120
a tycoon.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.280
Or a business hero,

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.800
that kind of thing.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:47.960
Hence Hong Kong.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.880
When I saw you earlier,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.840
I was stunned.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.800
You looked just like

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.360
those actresses

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.560
from my childhood.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.880
At the beach,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.920
crying your heart out.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.240
I thought, "This is it.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.480
A star

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.400
fading tonight."

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.000
Had to witness

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.280
history.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.480
Waited all night,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.160
but you weren't going to do anything.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.200
What a shame,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:11.760
real pity.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.960
You're so dramatic.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.640
Just nonsense.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.360
Normally, I'm

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.800
not this chatty.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.080
Do you think I'm annoying?

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.280
No, not at all.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.320
You're cute.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.440
Yeah?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.720
Okay.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.200
Tell you what.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.600
I'm older than you,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.440
and more experienced.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.200
If you need

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.120
interview tips,

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.120
just ask.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:35.680
Wait...

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.200
It should be...

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.240
Like this.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.120
Splendid.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.440
Cheng Man.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.480
Vice President.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.600
And your name...

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.800
Li Daoqi.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.720
I almost forgot to ask you.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.480
Nice to meet you!

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.440
Looking forward to working with you.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.440
Oh, come on.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.760
So, I can contact you anytime?

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.680
Right?

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.440
Well, not exactly.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.440
Don't call me in the middle of the night.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.240
Okay, okay.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.360
So, anytime except for the middle

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.320
of the night.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.000
Right?

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.600
Give it back.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.000
No, let me keep it.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.720
Put it in my pocket.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.680
The pockets are still sealed.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.760
Can I return this?

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.800
Big mistake

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.920
tearing the tag off.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.520
Do you wanna

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.240
ask the new director

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.840
to play soccer this weekend?

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.720
Nah.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.000
Why ask him? I don't know him well.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.320
Just with colleagues.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.920
Last Family Day,

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.200
I met his wife.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.960
We went shopping yesterday.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.440
She bought two jerseys.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.680
Said her husband

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.080
just transferred to the Lucheng City branch

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.120
and wants to connect with colleagues.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.600
I think you should ask him.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.200
He doesn't really seem like

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.520
the athletic type.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.960
When I was in Hong Kong,

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.520
I often played tennis with

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.120
the big shots from investment banks.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.560
One time,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.800
the big boss showed up.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.080
Everyone said he

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.360
was an amazing player.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.480
That no one in the company

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.960
could beat him.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.000
Bunch of brown-nosers.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.640
Well, not exactly.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.160
The boss was just okay.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.320
We played five games.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.280
He won three.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.480
The first two,

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.200
I wiped the floor with him.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.640
Then I lost the last three.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.080
Always by just a point or two.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.240
After that,

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.080
every time he played with friends,

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.120
he invited me.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.640
He even introduced me

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.720
to a lot of contacts.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.640
Got it.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.800
Okay.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.480
Mom.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.120
Coming. Stop shouting!

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.960
He's here.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.440
Happy birthday!

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.280
Get inside.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:43.880
So embarrassing.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.440
Mr. Fu.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.640
Brought you some tea.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.200
You brought me tea again?

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.560
You always get me the good stuff.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.360
It's nothing.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360
Where are Cheng Man and Nian?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.360
Uh, Cheng Man

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.200
isn't feeling well.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.320
So she didn't come with me.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.680
Told her to rest at home.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.600
The tea is for you.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.760
I'll put this cake in the fridge.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.280
Go on.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.800
Every time he comes,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.200
he brings me such good tea.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.960
Mingqian Longjing.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.080
Do it yourself.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.880
What?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.840
What's with you now?

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.320
You tell me.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.920
Cheng Man was going to come,

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.720
but then she heard

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.280
there would be strangers here.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.160
She was afraid Nian

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.680
would feel uncomfortable.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.520
She'll visit in a couple of days

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.800
to wish you happy birthday.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.680
"Wish me happy birthday"? So formal.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.000
I just wanted a simple

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.800
birthday celebration.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.200
A casual meal at home.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.480
Why couldn't they come?

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.280
Yeah.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.800
Nian is like this because you

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.640
kept him cooped up

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.480
at home.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.960
Think about when you were little.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.160
You were always

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.920
running around

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.960
all over the market.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.520
Yeah.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.240
Free-range parenting.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.720
And you were so talkative.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.840
Even I couldn't outtalk you.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.040
So kids shouldn't

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.520
- be overprotected.
- Yeah.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.360
I've said this so many times.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.600
Yes, I think you're

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.120
a hundred percent correct.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.240
Next time,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:51.840
fill this living room

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.560
with people.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.480
I'll drag them over here,

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.560
put them right in the middle.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.680
Let them get some social practice.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.280
You wouldn't dare.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.920
Go say hello to the others.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.320
Mr. Fu.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.680
Hello, guys.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.680
They're all praising how filial you are.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.720
Thank you, thank you.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.000
You remember them, right?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.560
Uh...

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.080
I...

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.640
This is Mrs. Yan.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.920
And Mrs. Liu, Mrs. Zhang.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.080
And this is...

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.440
Tan.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.320
Mr. Tan.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.080
Yes, Mr. Tan.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.480
Always bought Golden Hamsters from you

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.040
when I was little. Little mice.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.680
Hamsters.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.040
You always came to my place to play.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200
This is Mr. Wang.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.560
I met you

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.680
a couple years ago, Mr. Wang.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.600
Li.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.640
Yes?

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.760
Do you remember

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.680
your little brother?

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.160
My little brother?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.080
The one you always played soccer with.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.000
My son.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.520
Your son! Of course I know him.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.000
You scared me, calling him my brother.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.560
My mom never mentioned that.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.040
What's wrong?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.440
Nothing.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.160
I remember him.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.360
Not too tall, pretty stout.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.520
He was always picking on me.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.200
Picking on you?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.120
Yeah. I heard

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.400
he's in Beijing picking on others now.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.360
He's a big boss, isn't he?

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.720
That was so many years ago.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.120
You're holding a grudge?

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:10.760
No, no.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.800
Our relationship was always

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.840
just not that great.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.520
Don't take it seriously.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.440
What did you want to ask?

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.320
Well, he's coming back to get married.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.640
And they're looking for a house.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.880
Your mom said

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.320
the houses in your community

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.440
are really nice.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.000
Spacious.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.000
And the loan interest is low.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.640
Only 6,000 yuan monthly payment.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.480
What a great deal!

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.560
Could you keep an eye out for me?

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:37.920
Yeah.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.120
Keep her posted.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:39.680
Well.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.160
I'll ask around the community later.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.280
If there are any available houses,

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.000
I'll tell my mom

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.280
and she'll notify you right away.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.640
Look at Daoqi.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.960
The older he gets,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.920
the more accomplished he becomes.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.560
We've watched him grow up

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.640
since he was little.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.640
We all like him.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.400
So tall now. We wouldn't

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.840
recognize him on the street.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.560
Yeah!

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.080
Okay.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.720
Uh, I think...

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.400
I'll go check on my mom.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:58.960
See how the food's coming.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.480
I know you have low blood sugar.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:00.960
Right, Mr. Wang?

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.720
I should go ask her

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.040
if the food is ready.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.840
What's up?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.720
Madam Wang.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.400
I have a request.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.000
So serious? What is it?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.120
Could you please stop telling people

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.200
about my mortgage?

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.120
What do you want?

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.720
It's so embarrassing.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:20.960
Why shouldn't I?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.400
Buying a house is a good thing.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.680
Besides,

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.760
you know how those folks

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.680
from the market are.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.880
Their gossip.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.040
You're with Cheng Man now.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.600
She's older than you,

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.880
and richer than you.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.000
If I don't say something,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.520
how can I shut them up?

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.560
Cheng Man

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.000
paid 90% of the down payment.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.440
I'm only paying

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.600
the mortgage for the remaining 10%.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.880
So stop talking with them about it.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:41.880
So what?

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.160
You're still paying that ten percent.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:44.760
Let me tell you,

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.680
what you said is

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.320
absolutely correct.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.440
Then stop complaining about it.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.800
But please stop bringing it up.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.400
Fine, fine.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.280
Don't just stand there.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.120
Wash the vegetables.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.400
Okay.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.840
Manager Qiu.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080
This is Li Daoqi.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.920
I came to your office

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.760
last week

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.200
for an interview. Remember?

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.960
About the salary you offered...

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:07.840
I feel it's

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.800
a bit lower than I expected.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.600
Anyway,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.760
thank you very much for your time.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.120
Do you not see

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.400
the Yellow River

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.560
pour from heaven,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.680
rushing

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.480
to the sea,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.560
never to return?

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.960
Let me tell you all,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.640
it's not easy

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.680
for us to get together

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.280
after all these years,

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.800
alright?

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.280
We grow distant if we don't meet.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.960
Meet up more, okay?

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.400
Meet up more!

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.320
Come on.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:50.800
Cheers.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.040
Yudong.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.200
How have you been?

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.840
I heard from Daoqi

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.760
you're in renovation now.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:57.880
Yeah.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.880
It's just a temporary gig.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.120
I'll find something better later.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.680
Let me tell you,

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:02.960
you've been

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.600
abroad for way too long.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.360
Otherwise,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.760
you wouldn't have to

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.280
start from scratch like this, right?

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:10.520
Listen to me,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.840
don't worry about it.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.600
Don't overthink it.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.400
Just work hard.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.800
Hey, guys.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.760
Li Daoqi

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.280
just quit his job.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.440
Officially retired.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.120
Daoqi, when did you retire?

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.000
I'm

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.120
Why didn't you tell us?

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.560
officially retired!

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:29.520
Aren't you happy?

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:29.560
Aren't you happy?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.320
Retired life

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.120
is absolutely wonderful.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.000
Daoqi.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.639
It's like a dream!

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.639
Stop humblebragging!

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.480
You know what.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.840
Your life

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.400
is my dream.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.480
My life is your dream?

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.719
Well, that's good!

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.520
I'll have another bottle!

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.320
Guys.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.960
I'm so happy today.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.280
Let me handle him.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:04.920
Put it down.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.440
Alright, alright.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.240
No more drinking.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.280
Stop it.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.360
Stop it.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.400
Enough.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.600
Told you. Stop it.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.560
Sit down.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.800
Enough.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:16.760
Put it down.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.040
Stop drinking. You've had enough.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.440
Yudong.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.640
Yeah?

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.040
What's up?

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.240
I think I lost my car keys.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.000
I lost my car keys!

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.480
It's okay, don't worry.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.720
We'll find them.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.840
Nian.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.760
Today's sensory integration training

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.400
will end

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.520
half an hour later than usual.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.880
Roger. Standing by.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.240
Say goodbye to daddy.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:52.920
Bye-bye.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.080
Bye-bye.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.560
See you later.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.880
[Well done!]

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.840
[Well done!]

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.360
[Attack.]

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:29.880
[Nice!]

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.800
[Awesome goal, son!]

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040
[Ball's coming! Ball's coming!]

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.680
[Go, go, go! Charge forward!]

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.880
[Yeah, charge!]

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.280
[Attack, attack! That's right!]

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.760
[Attack!]

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.840
Nice!

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.800
[Attack!]

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.600
[Kick it. Yeah!]

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.960
[Li Daoqi!]

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.880
[Pass me the ball!]

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:15.880
Li Daoqi!

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.600
Pass me the ball!

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.520
Pass me the ball! Li Daoqi!

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.440
Hurry up!

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
[Why didn't you pass when I told you to?]

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.560
Do you even know how to play?

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.560
You just got lucky with that shot!

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.320
I told you to pass to me.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.240
Didn't you hear me?

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.120
I told you to pass it.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.840
Didn't you hear me?

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.040
I said pass to me.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.840
From now on, I take the shots.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.520
Got it?

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.920
Your job is just to pass me the ball.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.080
Understood?

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.200
Three cucumber skewers,

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.600
four lotus root,

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.880
four potato,

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.040
eight corn kernels.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.760
three chives.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.880
Want potatoes?

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.600
Yeah.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:22.680
How many skewers?

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.640
Ten.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.640
Too many.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.640
We can't finish that much.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.880
Make it seven.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.520
You ordered so much meat.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.560
Cut it in half.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.800
Excuse me.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:37.880
Coming.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.840
Here's our order.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.800
Okay, thanks.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.520
Leave it here.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:43.920
Pen.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.000
This little place's

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.640
still the same after all these years.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.800
Hasn't changed a bit.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.720
It has.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.400
Those little flags,

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.640
the TV,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.120
and even the paintings next to it

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.600
were all added later.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.360
Has my memory been playing tricks on me?

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.400
Well,

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:09.840
of course it changed.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.320
So long it's been

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.280
since we graduated.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.200
I remember that day

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.640
you got that offer

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.320
from the foreign university,

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.720
we drank here. I got drunk

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.480
and stood on the table shouting.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.520
So embarrassing!

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.800
Feels like just yesterday.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.760
Life was so simple back then.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.280
We just wanted some money

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.400
to afford a buffet meal,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.560
and we'd be over the moon.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.120
So happy.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.960
Time really flies.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.840
If we had known back in school

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.920
that more than ten years later

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.160
we'd still be the way we were,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.520
what would we have done?

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.360
Can't bear to think.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.920
You loser.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.600
I'm a loser.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.840
I'm a total loser.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.880
Loser.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.320
We're not

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:21.760
losers.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.160
Yudong.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.840
Believe me.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.240
We can still make it.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.960
We all have a place in this world.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.000
Look at you!

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.160
Yudong coughs and you change your move.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.320
You're totally cheating!

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.640
Who's cheating?

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.560
You are!

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.440
Jin.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.480
Stop keep calling him Yudong.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.320
Is "Yudong" for you to call?

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.000
My son-in-law, after all,

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.280
has a PhD!

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.320
You should call him Dr. Fu!

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.760
At my age,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.280
what's wrong with calling him "Yudong"?

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.800
True, you're quite old,

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.880
but how many doctors

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.360
have you met in your life?

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.240
Have you?

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.840
My son-in-law is a PhD.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.760
I only know full and

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.840
associate professors.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.400
What, do PhDs have ranks too?

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.600
Associate(same sound as Fu) PhD?

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.280
When do you get promoted to full?

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.360
Oh, Please, Mr. Jin.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.480
Don't say that.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.920
You can call me whatever you like.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.440
Close the door.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.040
Smell's wafting into the living room.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.000
How can we eat like this?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.040
It stinks!

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.560
Sorry about that.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.360
Let him focus on his meal.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.000
Don't keep staring at the phone.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:03.800
How can he focus on his meal

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.560
without looking at the phone?

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.240
Huh?

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:05.720
This bad habit

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.960
is all your fault for spoiling him.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.080
Enough. Eat properly.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.240
Fu Yudong.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:31.720
What are you doing?

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.240
Nothing.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.080
Just watching a video.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.360
What video? Why so nervous?

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.600
You know

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.840
this old place has thin walls.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.080
Don't watch anything questionable.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.960
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.080
It's not what you think.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.400
I'm going to shoot a video later.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.200
Help me out?

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:48.960
Come with me.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.760
You're free anyway.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.240
You're free, right?

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:54.920
Yeah.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.240
[What do you feel like eating?]

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.440
[Let's go grab a bite.]

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440
[McDonald's.]

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.320
[Let's go.]

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:25.880
[See?]

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.920
[If you don't study hard,]

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.040
[you'll end up like them,]

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.400
eating on the street.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.440
Hey,

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.120
my grades were pretty good.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.440
Let's go. It's not right to lie.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.120
I have a PhD.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.920
It's true.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.160
[Hey.]

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.440
[Take out the trash for me.]

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.200
[Thank you.]

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.080
Okay.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.080
[And close the door, please.]

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:43.840
Sure.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.160
[Yudong.]

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.960
[Be at the café downstairs]

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.560
[from your place in twenty minutes.]

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.120
Slow down.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.200
[Got a great idea! Definitely gonna work.]

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.320
[Didn't you say "we all have a place"]

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:33.920
["in this world"?]

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.480
[Now's the time.]

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.400
I thought you were just drunk

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.200
talking nonsense.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.440
Are you serious?

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.040
This brand.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.200
It's a household name,

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.960
great value for money.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360
I've already discussed everything.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.120
They said they'll transfer

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.880
the brand, formula, production line,

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.840
the whole package!

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.040
When it's done,

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.120
I'll be the CEO,

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.440
and you'll be

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.000
the head honcho

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.320
in charge of technology.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.120
Once the money's in place,

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.680
we're off to the races!

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:00.760
Don't be silly.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.840
I studied biochemical engineering,

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.040
focused on basic research.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.160
I've never paid any attention

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.200
to the skincare niche.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.560
The closest I've ever gotten to skincare

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.840
was the day I returned to China.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.120
I had a big pimple on my face,

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.400
so I used one of

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.120
my wife's products.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.200
That thing you stick on,

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.360
the clear one, what's it called...

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.000
A pimple patch.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.520
Right, a pimple patch!

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.840
As for those face creams,

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.200
all those bottles and jars,

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.880
I have no idea what they're for.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.080
What does that matter?

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.160
That got nothing to do with you.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.400
Those are just packaging.

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.960
You're a doctor

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.160
from the Royal College of Toronto.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.680
You just need to figure out

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.040
the chemical composition inside,

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.200
like the molecules and stuff.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200
You figure that out,

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200
and that's it.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.800
That's easy to say, but I...

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.080
Yudong, let me ask you.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.760
You want to develop your career

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.040
back here, right?

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.520
You've sent out so many resumes.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.720
Has there been a single job offer

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.480
that both you and Zhang Ran

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.240
are satisfied with?

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.320
Any?

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.520
See?

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.320
So why don't we

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.240
work together?

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:00.880
Even if things don't work out,

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:01.760
and the company fails,

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.120
you'll still have the experience

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.920
of being the CTO

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.600
of a cosmetics company

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.280
on your resume.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.040
If you're really worried,

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.200
I'll sign a contract with you.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.160
You'll have the right

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.080
to pull out whenever you want.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.520
Okay?

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.960
But when you leave,

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.000
I might not pay you

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.600
your full salary for the last month.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.120
Oh, and also,

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.920
don't tell Zhang Ran about this.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.360
I haven't told Cheng Man either.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.240
Let's keep it quiet for now.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.080
Who knows, maybe

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.400
we'll strike it rich

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.680
and surprise them.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.720
Then we can

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.520
hold our heads high with pride.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.520
Tomorrow I'll start visiting

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.120
investment firms, investors...

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:41.960
You don't have to worry about that.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.360
I'll meet them.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.600
You just need to be there

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.480
to support me technically.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.000
Is that okay?

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.160
You know the saying.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.280
Unity is strength, right?

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.480
We're talking big plans,

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.120
why are you hugging that old bag?

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.400
My tools of the trade.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.240
Listen.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.680
Hear that?

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.520
What?

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.960
Ding-ding-ding-ding!

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.920
Only mosquitoes buzzing.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.080
The NASDAQ bell!

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.760
I can already see you

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.840
hitting that button.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.080
Me clapping right beside you.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.080
You're insane.
