00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.640
This time around,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.600
is it up?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.960
But I still have things to say to her.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.760
Hey, are you okay?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.440
I want to hand in my paper.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.520
You can hand it in now,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.400
but,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.800
once you do, there's no turning back.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.240
The college you go to will change.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.480
The people you meet

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.240
and the jobs you do will all be different.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.520
Everything will be completely different.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.120
Are you sure

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.800
you want to take this risk?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.960
If you need the restroom,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.520
someone will escort you.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.720
I want to hand in my paper.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.160
Space-time has a rejection property.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.520
If it detects

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.160
something that doesn't belong here,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.800
it will force you back to your original world.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.120
If you try to fight this rule,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.440
your body may suffer irreversible harm.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.800
I don't care.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.560
Yu Xingchen, why did you hand in your paper?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.240
You're being so irresponsible.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.120
Whatever it is,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.720
can't you wait until after the exam?

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.600
What's wrong?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.160
Are you feeling sick?

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.120
There's no time.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.280
I'll take you to the nurse's office.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.280
Director,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.360
please give this letter

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.920
to Su Ruo from Class Three.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.040
Can you do that?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.600
This isn't the time for that.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.480
Go to the nurse's office first.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.360
Come on, hurry up.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.720
Director,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.000
please give this letter to Su Ruo.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.800
Can you do that?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.520
Hang in there.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.200
Director,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.320
You've confiscated a lot from us before,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.960
but you can't take this letter.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.320
Please give it to her.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.480
Alright, alright.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.960
After the exam is over,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.200
I'll make sure she gets it.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.080
Good.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.680
Su Ruo,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.040
Stay alive.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.520
LOCAL TIME, 5 PM

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.000
AS THE FINAL FOREIGN LANGUAGE BELL RINGS

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
THE 2010 COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM ENDS SMOOTHLY

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.680
ALL EXAM SITES

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.520
COMPLETE THE EXAM ORGANIZATION SMOOTHLY

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.560
ACHIEVE THE SAFE EXAM GOAL

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.960
AT MINGHE CITY FIRST HIGH SCHOOL

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.920
REPORTERS SEE

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.160
MANY PARENTS HAVE GATHERED HERE

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.480
PARENTS LOOK NERVOUS

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.160
BUT EVEN MORE HOPEFUL

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.400
It's over.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.520
Didn't you have something to tell me?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.040
Ah...

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.240
It's nothing.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.440
Su Ruo,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.760
I didn't do well.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.280
I want to be alone for a while.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.360
Don't be mad.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.480
I'm not.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.440
Su Ruo,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.400
You look great in white.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.120
Thanks.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.560
I want a fresh start in college.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.680
So I won't fall for someone

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.000
who likes someone else.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.600
How's my perm? Does it look good?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.280
It does.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560
Got a perm.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.200
See?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.840
Zhang Jie even got a perm.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.280
Darn it.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.680
Hui Ge,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.920
what are you reading?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.880
Tsinghua's extracurricular materials.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.680
Don't mind me.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.400
Tsinghua?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.160
How do you know your score?

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.720
You can just estimate it.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.480
It's easy.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.000
Impressive, Hui Ge.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.600
Ren Nan,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.880
where are you going this summer?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.960
Yunhai is pretty nice.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.440
I just got back from there.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.960
Seafood is super cheap.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.760
You already went on a trip?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.960
No, just went to see the sea.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.880
Not really a vacation.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.360
As for me,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.680
I'm planning after the results

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.400
to travel abroad.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.800
If you need help,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.720
I know Yunhai's resorts well.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.520
Just mention my name,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.000
and you'll get a discount.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.320
Alright.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.360
Thanks.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.360
That's odd.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.520
I don't remember writing this.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.400
You forgot?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.640
You bought this book for me.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.320
Then Teacher Jiang confiscated it.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.240
Oh, right.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.800
Can you get it back for me?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.320
And return it to me, okay?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.480
I don't remember that at all.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.080
Just go get it back for me.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.080
And make it my graduation gift.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.320
Please?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.000
Alright.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.480
Su Ruo,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.600
can I ask you something?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.400
People say we're close,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.240
but I always feel

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.400
we're not that close.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.640
Are we friends?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.760
Silly,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.240
of course we're friends.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.840
Is everyone doing okay?

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.640
Good.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.840
Let yourselves go, right?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.240
Anyway, the college entrance exam is over.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.000
Go for it.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.400
Teacher Jiang.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.120
You're dressed in such a bold red.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.560
It's graduation, after all.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.920
Make a wonderful memory.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.920
I promised you all before

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.400
that the things I confiscated

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.440
would be returned to you

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.600
when you graduate.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.560
Take your own things.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.680
Slam Dunk.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.320
This is Zhang Xun's, right?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.080
Take it.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.680
Teacher Jiang, it's for you.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.000
Take it.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.280
The Laws of Time Travel.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.720
Besides reading more books,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.360
learn some social skills.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.040
Teacher Jiang, I understand people,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.960
but not the ways of the world.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.240
You did your makeup well today.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.080
How about

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.960
I don't give it back?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.640
I want it.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.640
Norwegian Wood.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.560
Who is this drawing of?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.440
Su Ruo.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.640
Su Ruo.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800
Who drew it?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.240
Yu Xingchen, I mean you.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.760
You're an adult now.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.640
Why don't you have that old drive anymore?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.760
Teacher Jiang,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.800
I didn't draw it.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.960
I can't draw.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.960
You think I'm senile?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080
Yu Xingchen, I personally

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.480
confiscated this from you.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.760
Take it.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.680
Go get it.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.520
Hurry up.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.720
Go on, go get it.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.880
Go.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.080
It's a pretty good drawing.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.000
Maybe you should apply to art school.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.120
I know this past year

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.040
felt very long for you all.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.560
But time is relative.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.560
What you think is past

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.320
may come back at some point.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.240
What you think is far in the future

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.120
is actually right in front of you.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.320
Maybe you don't quite understand

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.240
what I'm saying.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.720
I'm saying the future isn't far.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.680
Very soon,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.760
you'll be my age.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.800
So, as your teacher,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.960
I hope on your journey ahead

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.920
you always remember

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.120
these three years of high school

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.800
and the friendship between classmates.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.800
In life's big exam,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.400
I hope you all get the results you deserve.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.960
Class dismissed.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.920
Stand up.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.120
Classmates,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.120
goodbye.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.680
We graduated.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.520
No matter which space-time we're in,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.280
Alright.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.200
Comrades,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.480
See you out there.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.800
Bye.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.000
Bye.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680
Bye.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.920
Su Ruo.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.920
Su Ruo.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.120
This is

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.920
what Yu Xingchen gave me on the first day of the exam.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.680
He asked me to hand it to you myself.
