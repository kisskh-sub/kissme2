‎-Hey!
‎-Come on!

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:09.697
Stay safe!

00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:11.574
Time machines haven't been invented yet?

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:13.159
They haven't.

00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:17.205
But a way to send data was discovered.

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:18.414
Data has no mass.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.792
It's just zeroes and ones.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.588
We use wormholes in digital space.

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:29.342
We can send things from 2055 to 2025.

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:31.886
If we try 2026, it gets lost.

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:35.390
By 2027, nothing gets through.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.183
Because they're prime numbers?

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:38.393
Exactly. I'm so smart!

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:40.854
Whatever. Forget the details.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:42.438
Can you tell me

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:44.983
what my future self

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:47.151
wants me to do?

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.612
I invented a drug.

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.825
Its recipe was stolen
and transmitted back to 2025.

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.744
That drug didn't exist then,

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:58.496
so it counts as altering history.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.208
And they think I'm the one who did it.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.838
If things stay like this,
I get the death penalty.

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:11.968
Tampering with history is a serious crime.

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:14.470
Wait.

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:18.057
If you get executed,
that means I get executed!

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:19.976
Exactly.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.188
That's why you need to find
the real culprit there

00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:24.856
and stop any changes to history.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.615
What are these
appearance forecasts based on?

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:36.951
There's a method
to observe the world's data.

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:41.456
Tampering with the past strains spacetime,

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.874
and it shows up in the data.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.085
Places with a strong distortion…

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:50.173
It's where Espers

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:51.883
who shouldn't exist are showing up.

00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:56.262
If word about Espers gets out,
you'll get fired.

00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:58.723
How do you do it?

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:01.100
Espers?

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:05.230
APPEAR

00:02:05.313 --> 00:02:06.856
They really do exist.

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:11.110
Her husband's not dead.

00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:13.613
You're her husband.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.407
Her Bunty, right?

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.284
You're Fumito.

00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:19.702
So, why do I call you Bunty?

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.623
You're Bunta, so that's why
you're Bunty, right?

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.209
Wait.

00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:30.296
This is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.340
a 3D hologram.

00:02:33.174 --> 00:02:35.843
My real body exists in the future.

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:36.928
The future?

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:38.763
The year 2055.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:40.473
Thirty years from now.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.767
Think of it like

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.103
remote communication in your time.

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:49.649
Are you Fumito,

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.860
Shiki's husband?

00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:55.363
And?

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:57.657
You're from the future?

00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:05.707
The Fumito in Shiki's memory

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.709
is the Fumito of this era.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:11.337
I'm his future self,

00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:14.257
30 years later.

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:19.262
So…

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:22.807
where's the Fumito of this era?

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:25.768
What is he doing right now?

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:28.688
If he's alive,

00:03:29.397 --> 00:03:31.357
he should live with Shiki!

00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:34.485
She loves Fumito!

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.030
It's not possible.
That is why you are here!

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:46.331
Know your place.

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:51.169
Do you want to throw away your life now?

00:03:54.255 --> 00:03:55.757
Quit your job?

00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:58.718
Lose everything again?

00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:08.686
You will keep living

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:11.689
in that company housing

00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:13.900
and keep working, just as before.

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:17.236
Because of certain circumstances,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.698
Shiki's memory is easy to overwrite.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.493
One night of sleep

00:04:23.576 --> 00:04:25.912
and she'll recognize you

00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:28.247
as the Bunty she loves.

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.167
I don't want to hold

00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:35.129
a grudge just because one employee

00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:37.256
was rude to me.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:40.009
For now,

00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:43.513
I can still let this go.

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:51.813
I guess…

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.524
you are right.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:00.696
Did I come off as…

00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:05.785
rude just now?

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:06.702
You did.

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:08.913
I sincerely apologize!

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.999
My tongue slipped!

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:14.127
Maybe I had too much coffee!

00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:16.921
Please rest well.

00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:20.216
-Good work today.
-Good work today!

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:22.927
Bunta.

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:27.432
You forgot this.

00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:41.988
I'm like a salaryman, huh?

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:53.708
Hello?

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:59.964
It's about Ichimatsu…

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:08.472
What's wrong?

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:12.351
Hello…

00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:25.072
I only grabbed him.

00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:26.949
Listen, I'm…

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.035
I'm…

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.078
-I'm your--
-Don't come near me!

00:06:31.913 --> 00:06:33.748
Get out, you murderer!

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:42.632
Ichimatsu!

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:46.302
Ichimatsu!

00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:57.271
Ichimatsu! Is he okay?

00:06:57.897 --> 00:06:58.898
Shion! Stop.

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:01.776
Ichimatsu!

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:04.528
What happened?

00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:06.447
He's trying to say something.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.450
Ichimatsu! Don't talk, just think!

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:11.786
My throat hurts.

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:14.622
-I need oxygen.
-He says his throat hurts.

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:16.707
He needs oxygen. Get oxygen.

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.543
It's in the clubroom! I'll get it.

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:24.006
He's dried out. His airways are probably
too dry, making it hard to breathe.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.217
How did Ohsuke's flower blooming power

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.219
-cause this to happen?
-Reactive oxygen.

00:07:28.803 --> 00:07:32.431
He uses reactive oxygen to accelerate
growth and make flowers bloom.

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:34.600
A flower bloomer
is really an Esper of oxidation.

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:38.479
-Oxidation?
-Oxidation damaged his cells and DNA.

00:07:38.563 --> 00:07:41.607
It's basically aging.
Ichimatsu, where's the E-capsule?

00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:42.984
My desk…

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:44.443
In the drawer.

00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:46.153
It's in the desk drawer.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:47.655
Ichimatsu is a dehydration Esper.

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:50.324
If he can control the fluids
inside his body,

00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:53.202
-it might help repair the damage.
-Got it.

00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:55.746
I'm cold.

00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:58.958
If he takes them all, he'll get a boost.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.251
-Get a hold of yourself.
-Drink.

00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:04.714
Ichimatsu, drink!

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.966
Drink!

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.957
‎TAKOPPI

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:22.792
Good morning.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:25.711
Morning.

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:28.339
You going in early today?

00:09:30.508 --> 00:09:33.594
No… I woke up for no reason.

00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:38.683
‎Oh!

00:09:39.183 --> 00:09:40.685
Smells good.

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:48.943
I'm heading out.

00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:51.445
Have a good day.

00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:54.925
‎LAUNDRY SHOP

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:56.719
Two of these.

00:10:57.219 --> 00:10:59.263
-And one jacket?
-Yes.

00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:03.809
Have you been well?
Everyone was worried about you.

00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:05.686
I'm sorry.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.814
When did I quit here?

00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:12.109
-I have no memory of it.
-You don't remember?

00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:13.194
No.

00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:16.822
In April, you suddenly stopped coming.

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:20.993
A couple of days later, a resignation
agent came saying that you quit.

00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:25.831
On your last day,

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:28.417
you disappeared mid-shift.

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:32.338
One moment you were here,
the next you were gone.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.174
When in April was that?

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.760
Um… On the day of the blackout.

00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:40.221
Blackout…?

00:12:18.217 --> 00:12:20.302
We finally got the nano-receptor

00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:22.930
from the new B team.

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:26.642
It took nearly six months to rebuild.

00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:30.437
Now that Bunta knows about me,

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:32.523
I need to prepare.

00:12:33.148 --> 00:12:34.817
The mission will proceed separately.

00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:37.695
There isn't much time left

00:12:37.778 --> 00:12:39.655
to alter the past.

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:42.700
TAKOPPI

00:12:42.783 --> 00:12:43.909
Delivery for you.

00:12:44.577 --> 00:12:45.703
MISSION 149

00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:47.496
"Place the enclosed vial

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.874
on Takoppi's porch shelf."

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.967
Makes no sense at all.

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:10.436
TRASH SCHEDULE

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:11.895
Okay.

00:13:12.813 --> 00:13:15.274
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

00:13:15.357 --> 00:13:16.650
Good morning!

00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:24.283
-Give me a call when you're finished.
-Yes.

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:27.119
ART CLASS

00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:30.539
You're from the neighborhood council. Hi.

00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:33.834
Did something happen to Senda?

00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.087
Yes, he had an accident in August.

00:13:44.762 --> 00:13:46.430
He died instantly.

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:53.520
MAMORU SENDA

00:13:53.604 --> 00:13:55.481
Wake up and eat this.

00:13:56.482 --> 00:13:57.566
I'll lift you. One, two.

00:14:10.454 --> 00:14:11.163
Tastes good.

00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:13.332
Right?

00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:15.417
I'm a pretty good cook.

00:14:17.044 --> 00:14:20.756
Why couldn't I do this for my wife?

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:24.385
My ex. We divorced.

00:14:27.304 --> 00:14:30.099
I thought doing housework
made me less of a man.

00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:32.935
How pathetic.

00:14:34.103 --> 00:14:37.731
Her doing everything for me
meant she loved me.

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:40.484
That's what I thought.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.945
Quit making that face!

00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:46.407
How about now? With Shiki?

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:49.702
It's my job after all.

00:14:50.369 --> 00:14:54.540
Doing nothing is what
a useless worker does.

00:14:55.374 --> 00:14:56.458
Job?

00:14:57.292 --> 00:14:58.335
Yeah.

00:14:59.586 --> 00:15:00.629
It's a job.

00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:05.718
Hurry and eat. I got to wash those.

00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:08.762
I'm sick, so be nicer to me.

00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:10.889
I'm not your girlfriend in Sendai.

00:15:10.973 --> 00:15:13.600
Even though you came
every day for me like you were.

00:15:15.936 --> 00:15:17.146
Don't worry about it.

00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:20.566
I owe you for what Ohsuke did.

00:15:22.818 --> 00:15:25.821
I'm really sorry for what he did.

00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:33.704
Ai… That's not

00:15:34.538 --> 00:15:35.831
your girlfriend's name, right?

00:15:37.082 --> 00:15:39.001
You kept saying it while you were out.

00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:41.712
Ai, come out.

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:44.923
Ai, don't disappear.

00:15:46.383 --> 00:15:47.843
Who is she?

00:15:53.724 --> 00:15:56.435
WILL BE CLOSED FOR A WHILE

00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:11.992
Sasuke.

00:16:14.328 --> 00:16:15.954
Did Hanzo ask you to come?

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.795
DON'T FREAK OUT, I'M IN 2055

00:16:22.878 --> 00:16:24.088
I'M ICHIMATSU, YOUR FUTURE SELF
SO CALL ME "I"

00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.632
-The future Ichimatsu?
-Yeah.

00:16:28.258 --> 00:16:31.220
It's me. So "I."

00:16:33.055 --> 00:16:35.057
-Can it talk?
-It can't.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.184
It's been silent

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:40.479
since that day in Odaiba
when we all fought.

00:16:44.108 --> 00:16:48.153
I didn't believe
it was my future self at first.

00:16:48.987 --> 00:16:49.905
But…

00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:52.991
it knows everything only I'd know.

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:57.329
Like when I stuck a pencil lead
into a socket and almost died.

00:16:58.122 --> 00:17:00.499
You didn't tell somebody that?

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:04.253
It knew when I started
growing pubic hair, too.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.464
-That's something you'd tell your friends.
-No, you don't!

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.008
-I never told anyone!
-Really?

00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:18.183
The Esper capsules are "I"'s invention.

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:21.895
Whoa. You're incredible!

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:25.190
Kizashi stole the recipe,

00:17:25.274 --> 00:17:28.026
and he's altering history with missions.

00:17:29.987 --> 00:17:31.655
As a result, ten million people will die.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.913
But is "I" allowed to tell you that?

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:42.958
Isn't that altering history too?

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:44.042
It is.

00:17:45.002 --> 00:17:48.505
But Kizashi's alteration is worse.

00:17:48.589 --> 00:17:50.257
That's why stopping him takes priority.

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:55.387
To minimize the impact,

00:17:56.013 --> 00:17:58.515
the person involved,
which is me, was chosen.

00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:05.814
If I fail,

00:18:09.318 --> 00:18:10.611
"I" gets executed.

00:18:12.696 --> 00:18:14.364
Funny, right?

00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:19.161
It ordered me around from the future,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.747
made me do everything…

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.584
then…

00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:28.587
just vanished.

00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:33.175
No matter how much I call it,

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:35.719
it won't answer.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.519
Dammit.

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:46.855
What's wrong?

00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:50.567
Does it hurt?

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:53.737
"I" disappearing

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.781
means two possibilities.

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:59.785
Maybe I should tell you now.

00:19:00.494 --> 00:19:02.663
-What?
-If someday

00:19:02.746 --> 00:19:04.748
I disappear without warning,

00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:07.084
think of two possibilities.

00:19:08.835 --> 00:19:10.462
Case one,

00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:12.839
the future changed.

00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:15.676
This world isn't parallel.

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:17.844
It's one continuous timeline.

00:19:19.012 --> 00:19:24.101
If 2025 changes,
everything after that changes.

00:19:24.184 --> 00:19:27.104
Which means there's a future
where I no longer need to contact you.

00:19:28.313 --> 00:19:30.065
Sounds good then?

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:32.776
The problem is case two.

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:36.405
You die because history was changed.

00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:41.493
If something happens and you die,

00:19:41.576 --> 00:19:42.911
I disappear too.

00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:47.332
Makes sense.

00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:58.218
But people don't just drop dead in Japan.

00:19:58.302 --> 00:20:00.762
Ichimatsu! Ichimatsu!

00:20:02.264 --> 00:20:03.432
"I"…

00:20:05.392 --> 00:20:07.311
"I"… I'm dying.

00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:10.314
I'm dying right now.

00:20:11.982 --> 00:20:12.983
I'm disappearing.

00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:14.985
Here.

00:20:16.653 --> 00:20:20.073
I'm cold. Disappearing. Freezing.

00:20:20.824 --> 00:20:21.908
I'm disappearing.

00:20:23.327 --> 00:20:24.369
It's so…

00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:28.040
so unbelievably…

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:31.835
lonely.

00:20:40.093 --> 00:20:41.803
I'm gonna die, eventually.

00:20:43.138 --> 00:20:44.514
You survived, right?

00:20:45.307 --> 00:20:48.226
You ate udon and you're alive!

00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:53.231
-"I" disappeared.
-We don't know that yet!

00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:55.108
Something probably happened,

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:57.235
the future changed,

00:20:58.236 --> 00:20:59.571
and it'll pop right back!

00:21:01.907 --> 00:21:03.492
"Pop right back," seriously?

00:21:05.035 --> 00:21:06.078
Yeah, pop!

00:21:06.787 --> 00:21:07.996
Like pop!

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:11.166
It'll just pop right back, right?

00:21:11.249 --> 00:21:12.918
‎So…

00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:14.127
‎It's okay.

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:38.151
‎MAMORU SENDA

00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:39.611
He went back to his parked car

00:21:40.612 --> 00:21:42.781
to pick something up

00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:46.993
and stepped into the road…

00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:50.122
and that was his end.

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:56.753
I wanted to see…

00:21:58.046 --> 00:21:59.423
his black egg painting.

00:22:03.343 --> 00:22:05.971
Senmaru died because of us, didn't he?

00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:10.559
We don't know how much
the missions were involved.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.395
Remember what Bunta said.

00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:14.980
According to Ichimatsu,

00:22:15.063 --> 00:22:16.815
we are being deceived.

00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:20.026
If we continue our missions,
ten million people will die.

00:22:20.652 --> 00:22:23.321
We're not saving,
but rather people will die.

00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:26.616
Are people just going to die off slowly?

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.036
Not in a big event, but one by one,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.123
in a miserable way.

00:22:49.848 --> 00:22:52.934
A mission in one hour.

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:54.895
Where?

00:22:58.064 --> 00:22:59.316
Mission 155.

00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:02.736
"Place ten concrete blocks
in front of the apartment."

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:05.322
Makes no sense.

00:23:05.405 --> 00:23:06.740
Missions

00:23:06.823 --> 00:23:08.992
never made sense, right?

00:23:10.744 --> 00:23:12.579
Ichimatsu lives here, right?

00:23:13.246 --> 00:23:15.207
You think this is unrelated?

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:21.504
If the timeline was altered so you'd die,

00:23:22.255 --> 00:23:25.508
-can't you alter it back?
-How?

00:23:26.927 --> 00:23:29.930
Espers aren't supposed to exist
in this era, so if we use our powers

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:33.058
-and do something big--
-Hey!

00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:35.852
Don't get mad.

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:40.148
Will Ichimatsu trip and die?

00:23:40.732 --> 00:23:42.734
He won't die from tripping.

00:23:43.777 --> 00:23:44.945
But Senmaru died.

00:23:48.114 --> 00:23:51.368
Ichimatsu just recovered, right?
He might trip and die.

00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:56.831
Should we…

00:23:58.124 --> 00:23:59.167
lay them down instead?

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.004
Yeah. Lay them flat,
so they're not in the way.

00:24:08.093 --> 00:24:10.428
What if they're too hard to see

00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:13.556
and he trips and dies anyway?

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.601
I feel like he'll die,
no matter what we do!

00:24:23.358 --> 00:24:24.901
I regret it…

00:24:26.695 --> 00:24:28.363
Involving you, Shion.

00:24:29.281 --> 00:24:30.115
‎Huh?

00:24:32.492 --> 00:24:34.160
I wasn't thinking.

00:24:35.495 --> 00:24:36.746
I was selfish.

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:42.711
I just wanted an ally.

00:24:44.087 --> 00:24:46.089
Someone I could talk to in this era.

00:24:46.172 --> 00:24:48.341
-I am your ally.
-Yeah. But still…

00:24:50.218 --> 00:24:52.178
You're only 17.

00:24:53.054 --> 00:24:55.432
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

00:25:12.365 --> 00:25:13.241
Welcome home.

00:25:13.992 --> 00:25:15.035
I'm back.

00:25:17.287 --> 00:25:19.080
I'll help right away.

00:25:19.998 --> 00:25:21.416
It's fine. Just relax.

00:25:22.042 --> 00:25:24.294
No, I can't do that.

00:25:39.684 --> 00:25:41.061
Bunty.

00:25:45.357 --> 00:25:48.068
What am I thinking right now?

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.155
I can't hear you like that.

00:25:56.034 --> 00:25:57.118
You're mean.

00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:00.997
I really can't hear you.

00:26:09.756 --> 00:26:11.466
Then listen properly.

00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:15.970
Did you stop loving me?

00:26:17.347 --> 00:26:19.015
Do you not want to be with me?

00:26:23.353 --> 00:26:25.230
There's no way I'd stop loving you.

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:30.652
Your face got wet.

00:26:31.194 --> 00:26:32.237
‎Oh.

00:26:44.874 --> 00:26:46.543
I wish I could hear you.

00:26:57.303 --> 00:27:00.807
I'm hungry and sad!

00:27:08.231 --> 00:27:09.399
Oh yeah.

00:27:11.776 --> 00:27:13.111
Do you remember where I lived

00:27:13.778 --> 00:27:16.906
before we got married?

00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:25.457
Did you forget?

00:27:35.758 --> 00:27:37.552
It was in Machiai-higashi, right?

00:27:38.636 --> 00:27:40.221
The apartment near the station.

00:27:41.681 --> 00:27:42.682
Right.

00:27:44.017 --> 00:27:46.352
What was nearby?

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:53.359
We ate at that diner a lot.

00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:55.570
The one with the good croquettes.

00:27:57.739 --> 00:27:59.699
Kashio Restaurant, right?

00:28:03.828 --> 00:28:05.205
Why the quiz?

00:28:07.207 --> 00:28:08.500
Just thinking about the old days.

00:28:10.793 --> 00:28:14.964
KASHIO RESTAURANT

00:28:21.054 --> 00:28:23.556
-Croquette set meal, please.
-Okay.

00:28:24.724 --> 00:28:26.684
One croquette set meal.

00:28:26.768 --> 00:28:27.685
Okay.

00:28:30.688 --> 00:28:34.025
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thank you.

00:28:35.318 --> 00:28:37.070
See you, Mr. Croquette.

00:28:40.281 --> 00:28:41.950
Thank you.

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:46.246
‎KASHIO RESTAURANT

00:28:53.503 --> 00:28:54.671
Fumito?

00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:06.349
Who are you again?

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:25.243
A new junction appeared.

00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:28.580
The year 2055 has been renewed.

00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:36.671
HEY! "I"!, CAN YOU HEAR ME? "I," RESPOND!

00:29:36.754 --> 00:29:38.131
Ichimatsu, you there?

00:29:39.132 --> 00:29:40.091
Ichimatsu?

00:29:42.093 --> 00:29:43.928
Hey, Ichimatsu.

00:29:49.058 --> 00:29:50.727
"I"!

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.104
You popped back! "I"!

00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:10.330
Bunta…

00:30:12.081 --> 00:30:13.458
met me.

00:30:15.585 --> 00:30:18.880
You were totally silent.

00:30:18.963 --> 00:30:22.592
Looking at the logs,
there's no record of communication.

00:30:22.675 --> 00:30:25.428
But I thought I talked to you every day.

00:30:26.554 --> 00:30:27.805
What do you mean?

00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:29.432
Something happened over there,

00:30:29.515 --> 00:30:31.601
and the part of history
that involves me changed.

00:30:31.684 --> 00:30:34.270
There was a disturbance.

00:30:35.271 --> 00:30:36.439
Disturbance?

00:30:37.815 --> 00:30:39.567
I think it tried to contain

00:30:39.651 --> 00:30:42.153
the contradictions
that arose in the world.

00:30:42.737 --> 00:30:43.738
But I'm not sure.

00:30:45.782 --> 00:30:48.576
Research on past access is banned,

00:30:49.202 --> 00:30:51.204
so we don't know much.

00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:55.041
You must be hungry.

00:31:08.429 --> 00:31:09.764
Sasuke!

00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:19.440
I'm just…

00:31:20.608 --> 00:31:22.235
really glad you're back.

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:26.781
I lost contact with "I,"

00:31:26.864 --> 00:31:28.491
and I kept thinking I'd die tomorrow

00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:30.994
or any moment--

00:31:33.079 --> 00:31:34.455
A FEW WRINKLES ARE NO BIG DEAL
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.042
"I."

00:31:39.794 --> 00:31:42.839
"I"!

00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:00.440
Where's Sasuke?

00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:04.152
They said it's minor. Just a light burn.

00:32:08.865 --> 00:32:10.116
What happened?

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:14.537
It's my fault.

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:16.706
That doesn't explain anything!

00:32:18.499 --> 00:32:20.043
Shion came…

00:32:23.963 --> 00:32:25.006
for revenge.

00:32:32.013 --> 00:32:34.766
Sasuke protected me.

00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:46.819
You protected him like I told you to, huh?

00:32:47.945 --> 00:32:49.072
Good boy.

00:32:50.323 --> 00:32:51.365
Sasuke…

00:32:52.158 --> 00:32:53.451
I'm sorry.

00:32:55.119 --> 00:32:56.079
Ohsuke,

00:32:56.162 --> 00:32:58.581
you've got blood near your eye.

00:32:58.664 --> 00:33:00.958
It's nothing. No big deal.

00:33:06.047 --> 00:33:07.757
He's the enemy.

00:33:08.341 --> 00:33:09.842
Go to hell!

00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:15.890
Buzz, buzz, buzz

00:33:16.682 --> 00:33:19.227
The bees are flying

00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:26.359
Wild roses are blooming around the pond

00:33:27.735 --> 00:33:30.154
Buzz, buzz, buzz

00:33:31.614 --> 00:33:34.158
The bees are flying

00:33:36.494 --> 00:33:38.746
Like I said, I'm single.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.914
Since when?

00:33:39.997 --> 00:33:41.332
Always.

00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:44.961
-Sorry. Excuse me.
-Huh?

00:33:45.044 --> 00:33:47.922
Do you know a woman
who works at the dry cleaners?

00:33:48.005 --> 00:33:51.008
The person who works
at my usual dry cleaners is an old man.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.304
Are you mistaking me for someone?

00:33:56.722 --> 00:33:59.308
Buzz, buzz, buzz

00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:02.562
The bees are flying

00:34:04.188 --> 00:34:07.817
Morning dew sparkles

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.028
And the wild roses sway

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.242
Buzz, buzz, buzz

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.662
The bees are flying

00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:28.212
Are you following so far?

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.381
Well, I guess.

00:34:31.132 --> 00:34:34.343
True, it seems you know a lot about me.

00:34:35.303 --> 00:34:36.637
And you are

00:34:37.555 --> 00:34:38.890
a hologram.

00:34:41.475 --> 00:34:43.144
Maybe I can believe
you are from the future.

00:34:44.812 --> 00:34:45.813
Thanks.

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:48.858
Now, it's April 2025, right?

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:53.404
We meet one year from now.

00:34:53.988 --> 00:34:55.823
April 2026.

00:34:56.574 --> 00:34:58.910
When I come here for the first time,

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:01.746
I forget my ID

00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:04.582
in my laundry.

00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:06.959
You learn my name,

00:35:08.002 --> 00:35:10.755
we get close, we date,

00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:12.882
and we get married.

00:35:14.175 --> 00:35:15.343
Okay…

00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:18.179
We will live upstairs
at the takoyaki shop.

00:35:18.721 --> 00:35:21.224
And you'll get a job
at Kobayashi Laundry nearby.

00:35:21.307 --> 00:35:25.019
If you know that in advance,
isn't that kind of boring?

00:35:25.102 --> 00:35:27.063
You'll forget about today anyway.

00:35:28.898 --> 00:35:31.567
That's the nano-receptor.

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:39.825
If you drink it, you can receive data

00:35:40.368 --> 00:35:42.620
using the power here.

00:35:43.287 --> 00:35:46.207
It's like Wi-Fi in your era.

00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:49.710
What happens if I drink it?

00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:51.671
Your memories get installed.

00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:55.341
-Whose memories?
-Future memories.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:56.884
Your future memories.

00:35:59.804 --> 00:36:02.223
My future memories?

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:03.349
Yeah.

00:36:03.432 --> 00:36:06.477
From yesterday until 2035.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.979
Ten years of memories.

00:36:09.313 --> 00:36:10.982
Those memories

00:36:11.065 --> 00:36:13.025
will get stored deep inside the brain.

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:16.153
When you wake up,
you'll forget everything.

00:36:17.154 --> 00:36:19.532
Then what's the point of installing it?

00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:24.870
To…

00:36:26.247 --> 00:36:27.665
save you.

00:36:41.137 --> 00:36:43.514
Buzz, buzz, buzz

00:36:46.058 --> 00:36:48.227
The bees are flying

00:36:58.362 --> 00:36:59.780
It's convenient, isn't it?

00:37:01.532 --> 00:37:03.743
Technology 30 years from now.

00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:06.078
You remembered everything?

00:37:06.996 --> 00:37:08.247
You came to the shop

00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:10.833
in April.

00:37:13.544 --> 00:37:15.421
The installation failed, you remember?

00:37:16.881 --> 00:37:18.215
During the blackout.

00:37:18.299 --> 00:37:19.300
Right.

00:37:20.426 --> 00:37:22.178
It was a small blackout

00:37:24.472 --> 00:37:25.348
affecting about 3,000 homes.

00:37:26.891 --> 00:37:28.726
There was no record of it,

00:37:30.561 --> 00:37:31.896
so I had missed it.

00:37:35.024 --> 00:37:35.858
Shiki.

00:37:37.568 --> 00:37:39.195
Shiki!

00:37:40.738 --> 00:37:42.907
Shiki!

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.617
The installed memories

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:47.745
-weren't optimized yet.
-Shiki!

00:37:47.828 --> 00:37:49.663
So, when you woke up,

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:51.999
you were confused.

00:37:53.417 --> 00:37:56.712
The memories that
should've been deep inside

00:37:56.796 --> 00:37:58.547
came to the surface,

00:37:58.631 --> 00:38:01.550
mixing future and present.

00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:04.387
You kept coming here,

00:38:07.056 --> 00:38:09.350
looking many times

00:38:10.851 --> 00:38:12.645
for your husband, Fumito.

00:38:14.438 --> 00:38:16.190
Even though you hadn't even met him yet.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.529
You'd cry, saying he died,

00:38:22.738 --> 00:38:24.365
and cry saying he wasn't here.

00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:27.743
I couldn't leave you alone,

00:38:28.494 --> 00:38:30.413
so I had you live here,

00:38:30.496 --> 00:38:32.665
even though it was
one year earlier than planned.

00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:36.043
I prepared the same items

00:38:37.128 --> 00:38:38.671
as the ones in our future home.

00:38:40.131 --> 00:38:41.799
For you to live peacefully.

00:38:44.593 --> 00:38:46.137
Instead of me,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.972
I had Mrs. Enjaku visit you.

00:38:49.348 --> 00:38:51.308
Eventually, you got better.

00:38:53.602 --> 00:38:54.770
But I didn't think you'd need

00:38:55.604 --> 00:38:58.858
a replacement husband.

00:39:00.943 --> 00:39:02.903
I looked for someone suitable.

00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:05.239
Someone with a similar build,

00:39:05.322 --> 00:39:07.450
respectful to women,

00:39:08.033 --> 00:39:09.660
safe, hardworking,

00:39:09.743 --> 00:39:11.412
obsessed with evaluations,

00:39:11.495 --> 00:39:13.789
and loyal to his boss.

00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:15.958
A strong corporate-slave type.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.587
Him being stingy wasn't an issue.

00:39:22.006 --> 00:39:23.048
His name…

00:39:24.133 --> 00:39:25.176
was Bunta.

00:39:32.224 --> 00:39:34.185
Don't worry.

00:39:34.268 --> 00:39:36.896
The nano-receptor left in your body

00:39:36.979 --> 00:39:39.023
made memory imprinting easy.

00:39:40.357 --> 00:39:41.609
We'll redo the install.

00:39:43.152 --> 00:39:44.403
The same vial

00:39:44.487 --> 00:39:45.696
is right there.

00:39:56.707 --> 00:40:00.419
If you drink it,
the reinstall process will begin.

00:40:00.503 --> 00:40:02.463
This time,
your memories will be optimized.

00:40:04.089 --> 00:40:05.549
Your confusion will stop.

00:40:06.425 --> 00:40:07.843
You'll feel at ease.

00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:13.057
These six months were all a lie.

00:40:15.684 --> 00:40:16.894
It was hard, wasn't it?

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.565
When the reinstall happens,

00:40:22.358 --> 00:40:24.860
you'll lose your memory
of the last six months,

00:40:25.653 --> 00:40:27.446
but that's how memory works.

00:40:28.405 --> 00:40:29.949
No one…

00:40:30.866 --> 00:40:32.076
has a flawless memory.

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:36.997
If I drink it…

00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:41.252
I'll forget the last six months?

00:40:41.919 --> 00:40:44.588
Yes, and everything
will go back to normal.

00:40:54.014 --> 00:40:55.391
Okay.

00:41:05.526 --> 00:41:06.694
Goodbye.

00:41:30.134 --> 00:41:31.760
Bunty is Bunta.

00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:36.432
My Bunty is Bunta.

00:41:40.227 --> 00:41:41.770
Not you.

00:41:48.193 --> 00:41:51.614
-Bunty…
-Shiki…

00:41:57.494 --> 00:41:58.871
I'm surprised.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.541
This can't be happening…

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.841
Please…

00:42:12.217 --> 00:42:13.677
leave for today.

00:42:15.554 --> 00:42:16.597
Shiki…

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.891
is saying the same.

00:42:21.769 --> 00:42:22.978
You think…

00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:26.607
you can give me orders?

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.359
Trying to…

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.570
erase me like this…

00:42:33.656 --> 00:42:35.199
You'll disappear anyway.

00:42:40.037 --> 00:42:41.830
Great, now that everyone's here.

00:42:46.168 --> 00:42:47.378
Boss!

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.381
-What happened?
-Bunta.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.424
What's going on?

00:42:53.759 --> 00:42:55.302
It's the perfect opportunity.

00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:57.388
-Let's talk about Nonamare.
-Sasuke.

00:42:58.138 --> 00:42:59.807
Sorry. Stay here.

00:43:01.225 --> 00:43:04.561
All of you were chosen by me.

00:43:05.479 --> 00:43:07.648
Under what conditions?

00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:09.733
That is to be

00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:12.444
outside the decision tree.

00:43:14.947 --> 00:43:17.533
Whether you exist or not
doesn't change anything.

00:43:17.616 --> 00:43:19.451
If you disappear, no one will notice.

00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:23.997
You affect nothing in this world.
That's what you guys are.

00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:28.460
If I hadn't given you E-capsules,

00:43:29.795 --> 00:43:32.256
all of you would have died this year.

00:43:36.927 --> 00:43:38.721
Non amare.

00:43:40.305 --> 00:43:42.141
You must not love.

00:43:44.393 --> 00:43:45.686
Because none of you…

00:43:48.313 --> 00:43:49.982
were needed.

00:44:14.798 --> 00:44:16.133
‎My resignation notice.

00:44:16.216 --> 00:44:18.177
‎Nice to meet you, Professor Ichimatsu.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.595
‎-Oh!
‎-Ohsuke!

00:44:19.678 --> 00:44:22.264
‎My whole life has led to this.

00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:24.475
‎I have to do this mission.

00:44:25.058 --> 00:44:27.352
‎You also love Shiki.

00:44:27.436 --> 00:44:28.020
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
