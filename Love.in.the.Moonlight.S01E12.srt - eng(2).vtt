"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 12-13)

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:34.418
I heard that Sasin was here.

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:38.653
He left already.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:41.726
Are you sure?

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:44.565
It's not that you're hiding him somewhere?

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.325
You still remember right?

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.046
What's gonna happen
if you're around him one more time?

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:51.805
You don't need to remind me.

00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:53.885
I remember everything.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.125
I remember that I need to protect his life with mine.

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:05.445
Don't say that to Pin-anong.

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:07.323
Don't you forget

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:09.845
that you are her husband now.

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:11.885
It's carved in my brain

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:14.085
that I'm her husband,

00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:16.165
your son, and

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:18.005
a leader of this timber business.

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:22.245
Is there anything else that you'd like me to be?

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:25.925
You can order me around. Because right now

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.165
it's like I'm losing myself completely.

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:30.965
I did everything

00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:35.445
to save you from embarrassment.

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.325
Your attempt was a success.

00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:41.685
I'm happy for you.

00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:05.125
Am I doing the right thing?

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:12.453
Soon,

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:17.005
our son will be normal, right?

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:42.969
My Little Prince,

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.085
you're still up?

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:53.685
I don't want to see you like this.

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:58.246
I want to see you happy.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:05.705
Can't you forget about him?

00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:11.525
I really can't.

00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:16.245
Memory about him

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:21.525
is the only thing that encourage me
to wake up every morning.

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:25.925
I'm still alive so that I can remember him.

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:31.045
When I forget about him,

00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:37.565
there's no reason for me to live.

00:05:21.962 --> 00:05:22.963
I think you should stop.

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:24.156
Hey!

00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:26.205
Just let me drink.

00:05:27.525 --> 00:05:29.845
So I can forget everything like Saenkaew told me to.

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:33.685
Sasin, you know it well that

00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:35.725
it's impossible.

00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:39.365
Your memories are not like written on a blackboard

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.485
that can be erased anytime.

00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:45.285
When you wake up tomorrow, and you're sober,

00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:47.365
you will think about him even more.

00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:53.725
If you're not stop drinking, you could die.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.126
Sasin.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:17.286
Saenkaew.

00:06:19.405 --> 00:06:20.406
I love you.

00:06:56.102 --> 00:06:57.125
Your lunch.

00:07:26.188 --> 00:07:27.189
It's your dinner.

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:17.885
I told you to watch him.

00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:19.885
I tried to stop him but he didn't listen.

00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:21.469
So heavy.

00:08:58.085 --> 00:09:01.285
Thank you Mr. Governor for inviting us

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:03.205
to your New Year's party at your place.

00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:05.325
With my pleasure.

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:12.405
Your granddaughter-in-law is quite lovely.

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:14.605
She's a perfect match to your grandson.

00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.305
It's too bad I couldn't attend the wedding.

00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:22.322
I'd like to wish both of you

00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:25.165
a lifetime of happiness and stay together forever.

00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:31.765
When will you give a great-grandchild to your grandma?

00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:38.045
I'll leave it to fate.

00:09:40.485 --> 00:09:44.165
Prince Nukul is here today,

00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:46.005
we should go over there and talk to him.

00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:47.005
Sure.

00:09:47.308 --> 00:09:50.565
Are you two coming?

00:09:52.305 --> 00:09:53.645
You two should go.

00:09:54.445 --> 00:09:56.565
I'll stay here and talk to the wood merchants.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:57.805
Sure.

00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:00.855
Please, this way.

00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:10.003
Wait.

00:10:19.462 --> 00:10:20.463
Pin.

00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:23.365
I think you're drinking too much lately.

00:10:30.485 --> 00:10:32.805
I'm drinking to be in a good mood.

00:10:34.002 --> 00:10:36.525
So people can see that we're happy.

00:10:44.485 --> 00:10:45.886
You should

00:10:47.282 --> 00:10:48.845
drink some more.

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:53.925
Hello, Chatree.

00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:56.446
- Hello.
- How're you?

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:58.885
- I'm good.
- Long time no see.

00:10:59.368 --> 00:11:01.369
I haven't seen your wife lately.

00:11:01.805 --> 00:11:04.205
- Is she good?
- She's fine.

00:11:05.755 --> 00:11:09.685
I'm glad to finally meet one of the relatives.

00:11:09.822 --> 00:11:10.925
So glad.

00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:13.405
Should we talk inside?

00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:16.085
- Let's go.
- This way.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.365
Easy there. Be careful.

00:11:36.342 --> 00:11:38.925
I heard that people of Nanta are struggling

00:11:40.045 --> 00:11:41.765
with heated civil war.

00:11:42.515 --> 00:11:44.162
Instead, the leader of Nanta

00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:48.717
is crossing the border to Thailand to travel, happily.

00:11:49.405 --> 00:11:50.445
I'm not here to leisure.

00:11:51.868 --> 00:11:53.285
I need to attend a meeting to discuss

00:11:53.369 --> 00:11:55.445
how to bring Nanta back to normal stage.

00:11:55.902 --> 00:11:58.325
And making Nanta people to be flourished like before.

00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:01.325
Can you do it?

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:08.126
A country led by a ruler with no brain,

00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:11.165
but only uses the muscles,

00:12:13.155 --> 00:12:14.705
it is waiting to be ruined anyways.

00:12:19.685 --> 00:12:20.686
Look at you,

00:12:22.685 --> 00:12:24.486
you're living in Thailand

00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:28.725
you can say and do anything. I can't stop you.

00:12:30.245 --> 00:12:31.365
In the past,

00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:35.245
you used Inthorn to attack me, didn't you?

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:37.925
A coward like him is bound to be a failure.

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.645
He damaged my plan so many times.

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.029
If you see him,

00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:49.246
tell him not to show his face in Nanta again.

00:12:50.525 --> 00:12:52.165
He didn't come to see you in Nanta?

00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:54.525
A coward like him?

00:12:54.965 --> 00:12:56.525
I don't think he would dare to go back to Nanta.

00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:07.445
The photos will be ready in two days?

00:13:08.205 --> 00:13:11.245
That's right. I just got off the phone with Hong Kong.

00:13:13.106 --> 00:13:14.405
Do you get all the photos?

00:13:14.925 --> 00:13:16.885
We got all of them, none of them was damaged.

00:13:20.308 --> 00:13:21.409
Hello, Somsak.

00:13:21.575 --> 00:13:24.083
Luck is on a good man's side like me.

00:13:36.628 --> 00:13:39.085
Excuse me, sir. Gen. Sattha,

00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:41.845
Minister of Forestry, asked to discuss about

00:13:41.982 --> 00:13:45.725
revenue from timber business in Chansaeng. It's urgent.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.045
Tell him to come in.

00:13:51.075 --> 00:13:52.076
Yes, sir.

00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:17.708
We can talk about the details later.

00:14:18.915 --> 00:14:20.255
This is huge.

00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:23.285
I need to think carefully.

00:14:38.668 --> 00:14:39.968
Expenses and incomes of last month.

00:14:40.962 --> 00:14:41.963
Thanks.

00:14:43.725 --> 00:14:45.045
Who did you talk to on the phone earlier?

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.485
What's huge?

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:55.405
When I make a final decision, I will let you know.

00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:10.445
Eww! Disgusting. This is so wrong and crazy!

00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:14.729
If Pin sees these photos,

00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:16.365
she will get so upset

00:15:16.845 --> 00:15:19.165
and she will divorce Prince Saenkaew.

00:15:20.202 --> 00:15:24.525
All their assets and timber business are under Pin's name.

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:28.325
We will seize all of them.

00:15:28.925 --> 00:15:31.605
And we will be rich like we used to.

00:15:35.882 --> 00:15:37.885
Should we send the photos to Pin?

00:15:38.725 --> 00:15:39.845
Are you out of your mind?

00:15:40.285 --> 00:15:42.805
If Prince Kamfah saw them first and seized them,

00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:44.645
- we'd be in trouble.
- What?

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:47.525
What're we gonna do?

00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:55.845
- My dad is severely ill?
- That's right.

00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:58.365
He got a high fever in the morning,

00:15:59.045 --> 00:16:01.245
and he almost passed out and fell off the stairs.

00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:04.105
I asked a doctor to see him at our house.

00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:12.445
Honey, did you call Pin?

00:16:16.122 --> 00:16:17.605
Is that him coughing?

00:16:17.775 --> 00:16:20.445
Honey? Are you coughing blood?

00:16:24.248 --> 00:16:25.249
Pin,

00:16:26.222 --> 00:16:29.245
you need to come down here to see your dad, hurry up.

00:16:30.045 --> 00:16:32.205
Don't wait for anyone. You should be here alone.

00:16:32.746 --> 00:16:35.847
Hurry up and you need to come here alone.

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.205
Sure. I'll be there as soon as I can.

00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:40.016
Okay.

00:16:42.415 --> 00:16:44.228
What's wrong with your dad?

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:48.485
- He's severely ill.
- Oh my!

00:16:58.882 --> 00:16:59.902
Honey?

00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:03.388
Honey?

00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:09.165
Honey?

00:17:20.962 --> 00:17:22.408
You crazy!

00:17:22.668 --> 00:17:24.925
You stole my food again?

00:17:24.995 --> 00:17:27.375
- I'm not crazy.
- Go away.

00:17:28.628 --> 00:17:29.875
Or I'll beat you to dead.

00:17:43.845 --> 00:17:46.645
That's Chai. He picked her up at the train station.

00:17:47.405 --> 00:17:48.925
- They're here.
- They're here.

00:17:49.808 --> 00:17:51.445
Lie down. I need to lie down.

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:07.443
Dad?

00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:10.605
Dad?

00:18:11.885 --> 00:18:13.125
How're you feeling?

00:18:20.408 --> 00:18:21.409
Pin?

00:18:23.595 --> 00:18:25.445
I suddenly feel much better

00:18:26.365 --> 00:18:28.165
after seeing your face.

00:18:37.862 --> 00:18:39.005
You're so sick.

00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:43.285
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

00:18:46.848 --> 00:18:47.849
Hello.

00:18:50.168 --> 00:18:53.305
Hello, how are you?

00:18:55.685 --> 00:18:57.485
You're all here?

00:18:57.935 --> 00:18:59.805
I have an important meeting in Bangkok.

00:19:00.425 --> 00:19:02.126
So I thought I should stop by.

00:19:08.528 --> 00:19:10.005
- What?
- I'm cold.

00:19:10.488 --> 00:19:13.085
I also brought you some herbs.

00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:16.605
I told Homthip to brew them for you.

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:19.365
Thank you.

00:19:35.805 --> 00:19:39.325
Didn't you tell Pin repeatedly to come here alone?

00:19:39.806 --> 00:19:41.845
They're all here, the whole family.

00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:44.925
You heard me that I told her over and over.

00:19:46.868 --> 00:19:48.525
What should we do next?

00:19:55.335 --> 00:19:58.485
It's a good thing that they're all here.

00:19:59.405 --> 00:20:01.406
We can take care of it all at once.

00:20:35.408 --> 00:20:37.365
You look so moody, Little Rabbit.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.085
Who did you call a rabbit?

00:20:42.485 --> 00:20:43.486
I called who?

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:46.485
I'm talking to my work.

00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:09.325
You followed me back to Bangkok.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.445
I'm not sure if you wanted to see my dad or someone else.

00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:19.365
My dad ordered me to come, so I needed to come.

00:21:23.275 --> 00:21:24.765
Don't worry,

00:21:25.445 --> 00:21:26.525
I'm not going to see Sasin.

00:21:27.962 --> 00:21:30.726
- I know my duty.
- Of course, you do.

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:33.705
I know how well you follow your duty.

00:21:34.847 --> 00:21:35.965
Where're you going?

00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:39.485
- You can't stand even one minute to talk to me?
- Pin.

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:41.566
Please stop.

00:21:42.942 --> 00:21:43.943
Don't start it.

00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:51.445
It will be much worse than this

00:21:52.568 --> 00:21:54.525
if you continue to choose this path.

00:21:55.365 --> 00:21:59.165
You know that it won't end well.

00:21:59.845 --> 00:22:02.445
One day, you could wake up and realize that

00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:04.726
a man who you love with all your heart

00:22:05.526 --> 00:22:07.965
looks at you with full of hatred.

00:22:09.565 --> 00:22:12.566
One day, you could hear Prince Saenkaew calls your name

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:16.295
but it isn't in a gentle tone like he used to.

00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:20.765
Instead, his voice will be full of anger and torment.

00:22:22.005 --> 00:22:24.766
That is the day that you will finally realize

00:22:25.685 --> 00:22:28.005
the taste of real pain.

00:23:36.868 --> 00:23:38.005
Sanya?

00:23:39.725 --> 00:23:41.805
When did you come back here?

00:23:47.235 --> 00:23:49.085
Just yesterday.

00:23:50.155 --> 00:23:53.005
I'm here to see Dad. He's not feeling well.

00:24:08.685 --> 00:24:10.005
You look at me like this.

00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:13.085
You think I look so ridiculous, don't I?

00:24:14.845 --> 00:24:17.445
I know it well that you.

00:24:18.205 --> 00:24:19.206
Mingmitr

00:24:20.168 --> 00:24:22.855
and Ms. Rachawadee are on Sasin's side.

00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:26.085
Nobody welcomes me here,

00:24:27.005 --> 00:24:28.606
still I'm here.

00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:31.325
It's nothing like that.

00:24:32.845 --> 00:24:34.565
You can come here anytime.

00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:47.905
I miss the old days

00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:56.406
when life seemed so simple and easy.

00:24:59.365 --> 00:25:01.085
I sneaked out here

00:25:02.485 --> 00:25:03.905
to listen to music

00:25:06.062 --> 00:25:07.125
to dance

00:25:10.248 --> 00:25:12.705
and I was so happy.

00:25:16.005 --> 00:25:18.365
Today, I've tried so hard

00:25:21.245 --> 00:25:22.445
and still I'm not happy.

00:25:25.035 --> 00:25:27.125
No matter how hard I've tried,

00:25:27.965 --> 00:25:29.045
he still doesn't love me.

00:25:38.525 --> 00:25:39.526
Pin,

00:25:41.805 --> 00:25:43.765
it's not about trying when it comes to love.

00:25:45.006 --> 00:25:46.445
It's about our hearts.

00:25:48.705 --> 00:25:52.706
I've been falling in love with you for such a long time.

00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:59.005
I tried to do anything for you to notice.

00:26:01.045 --> 00:26:02.605
But you still don't love me back.

00:26:07.525 --> 00:26:08.845
It's not your fault

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:10.727
for not loving me back.

00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:15.645
Same does Saenkaew.

00:26:35.528 --> 00:26:38.005
I'm glad to see you again.

00:26:38.775 --> 00:26:41.925
I should leave you alone.

00:26:47.725 --> 00:26:48.965
Sanya,

00:26:54.442 --> 00:26:56.105
how is Sasin?

00:27:17.442 --> 00:27:20.125
See? You never listened to me.

00:27:20.615 --> 00:27:22.565
I told you not to drink too much.

00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:26.105
Now you puked in blood. What're you gonna do?

00:27:27.365 --> 00:27:28.485
I don't care.

00:27:30.288 --> 00:27:32.686
It's either dead of alive.

00:27:34.435 --> 00:27:35.436
How could you say that?

00:27:35.842 --> 00:27:38.082
If you were my child, I'd hit you for sure.

00:27:38.415 --> 00:27:40.805
You're still young, how could you talk about death?

00:27:41.245 --> 00:27:43.246
This is not Sasin that I used to know.

00:27:45.046 --> 00:27:47.965
Get up and eat. Now!

00:27:48.525 --> 00:27:49.526
Come on!

00:27:49.765 --> 00:27:52.605
Or I'll pour it down your throat, come on!

00:27:54.468 --> 00:27:55.469
Give it to me.

00:28:06.408 --> 00:28:07.409
Just eat it.

00:28:18.428 --> 00:28:19.429
Sasin?

00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:20.616
What's going on?

00:28:21.975 --> 00:28:22.976
Sasin?

00:28:23.135 --> 00:28:24.925
It must be from spring onions in congee.

00:28:27.235 --> 00:28:28.236
Pin?

00:28:31.895 --> 00:28:33.822
When he is sick,
his sense of smell will be stronger.

00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:37.445
He doesn’t like the smell of spring onions.

00:28:48.202 --> 00:28:50.245
I brew some herbs from Chansaeng.

00:28:51.525 --> 00:28:52.905
You should drink it and it'll cure you.

00:28:55.855 --> 00:28:56.856
How did you get here?

00:28:57.942 --> 00:28:59.565
She's in Bangkok to visit his dad.

00:29:00.325 --> 00:29:03.485
When she heard that you're sick,
she wanted to see you.

00:29:12.525 --> 00:29:13.526
Is it true?

00:29:16.915 --> 00:29:18.685
Thank you for still thinking about me.

00:29:20.368 --> 00:29:22.369
We promised my mom

00:29:24.245 --> 00:29:25.525
that we will take care of each other.

00:29:28.325 --> 00:29:29.525
You must have forgotten about it,

00:29:31.365 --> 00:29:32.805
but I haven't.

00:29:42.562 --> 00:29:43.605
I'm sorry.

00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:45.445
I'm sorry for making you sad.

00:29:48.795 --> 00:29:51.085
I know that my apology isn't enough

00:29:53.287 --> 00:29:55.725
but I feel really bad for hurting you.

00:29:58.845 --> 00:29:59.846
It's all right.

00:30:02.908 --> 00:30:04.965
Because I'm happy with my life right now.

00:30:12.048 --> 00:30:15.725
Please give him this herbal remedy.

00:30:16.688 --> 00:30:17.805
I need to go.

00:30:19.889 --> 00:30:21.725
Please take care of him.

00:30:23.245 --> 00:30:24.246
Wait.

00:30:27.148 --> 00:30:28.149
Well?

00:30:28.775 --> 00:30:30.205
Are you in Bangkok by yourself?

00:30:33.955 --> 00:30:34.956
Nope.

00:30:39.285 --> 00:30:40.386
I'm here with my husband.

00:30:42.488 --> 00:30:43.605
I should go.

00:30:45.042 --> 00:30:46.043
Get better soon.

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:17.709
What is it?

00:31:20.388 --> 00:31:22.189
Are you feeling well?

00:31:24.828 --> 00:31:25.765
You don't need to know.

00:31:27.388 --> 00:31:29.708
Did Prince Kamfah ask you to transfer his assets back?

00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:32.126
Not yet.

00:31:32.965 --> 00:31:34.205
Why're you asking me that?

00:31:35.535 --> 00:31:36.536
Good.

00:31:36.685 --> 00:31:38.686
Don't give anything back to him, okay?

00:31:39.086 --> 00:31:40.365
Not even one baht.

00:31:41.087 --> 00:31:43.165
But you made an agreement with him

00:31:43.497 --> 00:31:45.965
that I need to transfer everything back in three months.

00:31:48.288 --> 00:31:52.045
I made that agreement
because I thought he was a good man.

00:31:52.885 --> 00:31:54.605
I thought he'd love you like his own daughter.

00:31:56.195 --> 00:31:59.685
I thought you'd be happy when you married his son.

00:32:01.645 --> 00:32:03.365
I've never thought that

00:32:04.615 --> 00:32:08.045
he would have an evil plan to fool everyone.

00:32:10.568 --> 00:32:11.885
What do you know?

00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:19.445
He let you married his homosexual son.

00:32:21.688 --> 00:32:25.205
More importantly, he had an affair with Sasin.

00:32:57.802 --> 00:32:59.325
Where did you get these photos?

00:33:00.205 --> 00:33:01.206
Doesn't matter.

00:33:02.005 --> 00:33:05.365
Your job is to show these photos to Saenkaew.

00:33:05.688 --> 00:33:06.789
And divorce him.

00:33:07.205 --> 00:33:10.617
Then you need to collect their assets
as your compensation.

00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:13.765
If they don't agree,

00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:16.005
I will expose these photos

00:33:16.222 --> 00:33:18.765
to newspapers and people will find out

00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:21.445
the true color of

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.645
Prince Kamfah's son.

00:33:24.367 --> 00:33:25.846
Please calm down.

00:33:27.085 --> 00:33:29.286
I'll handle the divorce.

00:33:32.088 --> 00:33:33.089
And…

00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:35.725
do you have all photos of them?

00:33:36.362 --> 00:33:38.835
Yes. But I have this negative.

00:33:39.428 --> 00:33:40.765
We can get more copies if we want.

00:33:41.485 --> 00:33:42.886
Can I get it too?

00:33:43.686 --> 00:33:44.687
Why would you want that for?

00:33:45.285 --> 00:33:46.605
I'll threaten them with this.

00:33:47.365 --> 00:33:48.805
To show them what we're capable of.

00:33:51.315 --> 00:33:52.605
So clever, my girl.

00:34:07.348 --> 00:34:09.305
I think you need to take care of it

00:34:09.402 --> 00:34:10.845
while they're in Bangkok.

00:34:11.968 --> 00:34:14.805
If something unexpected happens,
I can still help you out.

00:34:18.982 --> 00:34:19.983
Don't you worry.

00:34:21.608 --> 00:34:24.005
I'll take care of everything before I head back.

00:34:48.148 --> 00:34:50.605
Thank you for agreeing to meet me today.

00:34:50.925 --> 00:34:52.305
I'm not here because of you.

00:34:53.975 --> 00:34:56.525
I'm here as a good citizen of Chansaeng.

00:35:02.735 --> 00:35:03.736
If so,

00:35:04.525 --> 00:35:06.765
well I need to appreciate you even more.

00:35:11.082 --> 00:35:12.365
Let's get to business.

00:35:19.688 --> 00:35:20.689
What did you just say?

00:35:21.489 --> 00:35:24.845
Kalong proposed a position for you
to be an economic advisor for Nanta?

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.821
That's right.

00:35:27.285 --> 00:35:28.725
And I said yes.

00:35:30.008 --> 00:35:32.965
Nanta is facing with economic crisis.

00:35:33.705 --> 00:35:34.706
I see that

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.726
our knowledge in wood business

00:35:38.645 --> 00:35:40.565
could save his administration

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.725
and boost up business in Chansaeng.

00:35:43.765 --> 00:35:44.766
Help Kalong?

00:35:45.525 --> 00:35:48.485
A person that caused us to escape from Chansaeng?

00:35:50.725 --> 00:35:53.765
A person who killed Uncle Lafah
and other royal family members in Nanta?

00:35:54.962 --> 00:35:56.925
You're gonna help him?

00:35:57.525 --> 00:35:58.885
I did it for Chansaeng

00:36:00.088 --> 00:36:01.405
for our hometown

00:36:02.162 --> 00:36:04.645
for our opportunity and future.

00:36:05.645 --> 00:36:06.646
For us?

00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:09.765
You meant for you and Kalong, right?

00:36:09.882 --> 00:36:12.005
- Saenkaew?
- In the end, there is no eternal allies,

00:36:12.805 --> 00:36:14.165
and no perpetual enemies.

00:36:15.005 --> 00:36:16.605
It's all about benefit.

00:36:17.325 --> 00:36:18.165
What about me?

00:36:20.283 --> 00:36:22.005
I sacrificed everything.

00:36:22.888 --> 00:36:24.525
I agreed to married someone I don't love.

00:36:25.765 --> 00:36:28.126
I agreed to stay away
from someone I love with all my heart.

00:36:29.565 --> 00:36:31.166
All of that was for nothing?

00:36:31.482 --> 00:36:32.885
What happened between me and Kalong

00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:34.925
is all about politics.

00:36:35.362 --> 00:36:37.125
But your story is different.

00:36:39.005 --> 00:36:41.365
The disgusting behavior of you and Sasin

00:36:42.045 --> 00:36:43.725
can't be accepted by anyone.

00:36:46.695 --> 00:36:47.696
For me

00:36:48.845 --> 00:36:51.605
what I did was less shameless
than being hungry for money

00:36:51.646 --> 00:36:53.685
and neglected morals like what you're about to do.

00:37:47.015 --> 00:37:49.645
Pin? I thought you have something to talk to me.

00:37:50.285 --> 00:37:51.286
What is it about?

00:37:51.588 --> 00:37:53.325
Why do we have to walk here?

00:37:54.895 --> 00:37:57.095
I don't want anyone to hear what we're about to discuss.

00:38:10.062 --> 00:38:11.063
Pin?

00:38:12.245 --> 00:38:14.125
I think we can talk right here.

00:38:15.175 --> 00:38:16.605
We don't have to walk all the way to that place.

00:38:21.548 --> 00:38:23.549
I miss this old place.

00:38:25.108 --> 00:38:28.205
I stayed with Mom for so long
then I gave it to Sasin.

00:38:30.305 --> 00:38:33.105
So many good memories happened there.

00:38:41.202 --> 00:38:43.203
You like that place too, don't you?

00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:58.803
Let me go.

00:38:59.108 --> 00:39:00.109
Let me go.

00:39:00.448 --> 00:39:01.925
Where're you going, thief?

00:39:36.728 --> 00:39:37.729
I think I should go.

00:39:38.468 --> 00:39:40.905
I promised Grandma that I'll take her shopping.

00:39:42.085 --> 00:39:44.725
My dad had photos of you kissing Sasin.

00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:52.165
He wanted to use them to
ask for more money from you and your dad.

00:39:54.845 --> 00:39:57.045
I got them all, photos and negative.

00:40:00.188 --> 00:40:03.245
If you want to destroy them,
you can get them from the house.

00:40:05.248 --> 00:40:06.365
I put them up there.

00:40:50.828 --> 00:40:51.742
It really is you!

00:40:57.022 --> 00:40:58.023
Sasin?

00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:07.155
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:41:58.942 --> 00:42:00.085
How did you get here?

00:42:07.642 --> 00:42:08.645
Pin came to see me

00:42:10.085 --> 00:42:11.485
she saw that I was sick.

00:42:12.765 --> 00:42:13.925
She felt bad for me

00:42:15.005 --> 00:42:16.285
so she let me stay here.

00:42:19.675 --> 00:42:20.676
What about you?

00:42:21.835 --> 00:42:22.836
What're you doing here?

00:42:26.405 --> 00:42:29.365
Pin told me to look for photos of us kissing.

00:42:31.082 --> 00:42:33.045
She said that she kept them here.

00:42:34.535 --> 00:42:35.365
Did you see it?

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:38.006
Photos?

00:42:39.828 --> 00:42:40.829
I didn't see anything.

00:42:41.962 --> 00:42:43.905
Pin didn't come to this place for a while.

00:42:48.428 --> 00:42:49.245
But…

00:43:26.448 --> 00:43:27.449
Sasin.

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:32.846
I gave Saenkaew back to you.

00:44:09.488 --> 00:44:11.005
I think I should go.

00:44:12.755 --> 00:44:13.756
Can you stay a little longer please?

00:44:15.485 --> 00:44:17.085
I still miss you.

00:44:19.805 --> 00:44:21.005
It's not easy

00:44:22.205 --> 00:44:23.685
to live without you.

00:44:25.055 --> 00:44:26.056
I know.

00:44:28.182 --> 00:44:29.325
Nothing is easy

00:44:30.565 --> 00:44:31.925
if we have to live alone.

00:44:34.685 --> 00:44:37.285
The only thing that keeps me going

00:44:39.708 --> 00:44:41.605
is to know that you're still safe.

00:44:43.268 --> 00:44:44.269
Therefore,

00:44:48.325 --> 00:44:49.326
I need to go.

00:44:52.245 --> 00:44:53.325
Good luck in everything.

00:44:55.765 --> 00:44:56.605
Saenkaew!

00:45:02.285 --> 00:45:03.445
Please stay.

00:45:04.355 --> 00:45:05.356
Please?

00:45:09.508 --> 00:45:10.509
Just a little bit.

00:45:14.475 --> 00:45:16.565
I want to memorize your face.

00:45:18.725 --> 00:45:19.926
I want to feel you.

00:45:25.685 --> 00:45:28.886
Let me be happy for just a minute.

00:46:05.415 --> 00:46:06.416
Saenkaew!

00:46:09.728 --> 00:46:10.729
Grandma.

00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:12.805
Grandma.

00:46:17.282 --> 00:46:18.365
Grandma!

00:46:19.195 --> 00:46:20.196
- Grandma.
- Grandma!

00:46:20.655 --> 00:46:22.656
- Grandma.
- Grandma!

00:46:22.695 --> 00:46:23.696
- Prince Saenkaew!
- Grandma!

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.565
Prince Saenkaew?

00:46:27.915 --> 00:46:29.165
Grandma!

00:46:38.135 --> 00:46:40.405
I shouldn't have called you two here to meet up.

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.525
Otherwise, she wouldn't been like this.

00:46:47.445 --> 00:46:49.005
I'm really sorry.

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.983
- She's awake now.
- Grandma?

00:47:01.948 --> 00:47:02.949
Grandma!

00:47:04.125 --> 00:47:05.126
Grandma!

00:47:05.148 --> 00:47:06.325
How are you feeling?

00:47:11.125 --> 00:47:13.445
You and Sasin?

00:47:20.445 --> 00:47:21.446
Grandma.

00:47:22.235 --> 00:47:23.605
I'm sorry that I kept it from you.

00:47:25.165 --> 00:47:26.266
I love Saenkaew.

00:47:27.575 --> 00:47:29.025
We are in love.

00:47:37.702 --> 00:47:39.305
But Saenkaew and…

00:47:40.428 --> 00:47:41.429
Pin.

00:47:42.125 --> 00:47:45.445
I know about them even before the wedding.

00:47:47.428 --> 00:47:50.445
But I still pushed to marry him.

00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:54.566
Please don't be mad at him.

00:48:00.288 --> 00:48:01.445
I'm sorry.

00:48:02.608 --> 00:48:04.085
Please forgive me.

00:48:07.405 --> 00:48:09.606
Please be okay.

00:48:14.645 --> 00:48:18.325
I'm worried that I'd lose you like I lost my mom.

00:48:19.862 --> 00:48:21.925
I promise you that

00:48:23.045 --> 00:48:27.085
I won't come to see Sasin again. I promise.

00:48:32.445 --> 00:48:34.205
Why would you do that?

00:48:35.125 --> 00:48:36.595
You love him.

00:48:37.055 --> 00:48:39.445
Why wouldn't you want to see him again?

00:48:49.965 --> 00:48:51.685
Why didn't you tell me?

00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:55.382
You've kept this

00:48:56.005 --> 00:48:59.915
all to yourself and been tortured all alone?

00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:04.445
Why didn't you tell me?

00:49:07.068 --> 00:49:09.485
I could help.

00:49:11.135 --> 00:49:12.136
Grandma?

00:49:13.862 --> 00:49:17.485
You're not disgusted that I'm like this?

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:24.305
You're a wonderful boy

00:49:25.765 --> 00:49:27.766
you've sacrificed a lot,

00:49:29.948 --> 00:49:31.705
why would I be disgusted?

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:40.705
Don't worry.

00:49:42.765 --> 00:49:45.445
I'll stand by his side.

00:50:13.468 --> 00:50:14.655
Thank you.

00:50:32.742 --> 00:50:34.805
May bad things stay away from me.

00:50:35.045 --> 00:50:37.405
May you attract only good things.

00:50:38.642 --> 00:50:40.143
This cotton thread

00:50:41.165 --> 00:50:43.725
is a blessing from me.

00:50:45.045 --> 00:50:46.685
I tied these for you

00:50:48.165 --> 00:50:51.855
and I wish you to be strong

00:50:53.257 --> 00:50:55.485
with a stable heart

00:50:56.045 --> 00:50:57.645
just like this thread.

00:51:10.755 --> 00:51:12.685
The world could judge

00:51:14.005 --> 00:51:16.445
and the path could be rough,

00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:20.705
but I wish love from two of you

00:51:22.105 --> 00:51:24.325
will protect one another.

00:51:28.155 --> 00:51:30.283
Please take care of Saenkaew.

00:51:31.875 --> 00:51:32.876
Sure, I will.

00:51:38.685 --> 00:51:42.845
I don't care if others disapprove this,

00:51:44.085 --> 00:51:45.525
as for me,

00:51:46.445 --> 00:51:49.845
you two received thread tying blessing ceremony

00:51:50.155 --> 00:51:52.405
from Chansaeng tradition.

00:51:53.645 --> 00:51:57.885
And you're now life partners.

00:52:16.215 --> 00:52:18.845
Can I tie the thread to

00:52:19.462 --> 00:52:21.405
bless both of them?

00:52:21.965 --> 00:52:24.205
Sure you can, come here.

00:52:46.165 --> 00:52:49.045
When Grandma tied the threads

00:52:50.485 --> 00:52:51.686
for us last time,

00:52:52.365 --> 00:52:55.128
you're tied to me because of your duty.

00:52:59.228 --> 00:53:01.045
But this time I hope

00:53:01.962 --> 00:53:03.325
that this thread

00:53:04.605 --> 00:53:07.365
will tie your love with Sasin.

00:53:19.142 --> 00:53:19.845
Pin?

00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:23.405
It's all my fault.

00:53:25.275 --> 00:53:26.285
I'm sorry.

00:53:27.645 --> 00:53:29.485
I should have told you the truth sooner.

00:53:31.995 --> 00:53:33.405
I was a coward.

00:53:34.288 --> 00:53:36.365
I was too ashamed to say it out.

00:54:04.528 --> 00:54:05.995
Please take care of

00:54:09.285 --> 00:54:11.645
Saenkaew for me.

00:54:15.548 --> 00:54:16.485
Thank you so much.

00:54:18.462 --> 00:54:19.463
Come here.

00:54:39.645 --> 00:54:41.305
Now I understand

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:44.965
that love is not about owning someone

00:54:47.165 --> 00:54:48.765
but it is to be happy

00:54:48.805 --> 00:54:51.005
when someone we love is happy.

00:54:55.645 --> 00:54:57.765
I want you to remember me

00:54:58.565 --> 00:55:00.165
as a sister who loves

00:55:02.245 --> 00:55:03.925
and means well to you.

00:55:06.868 --> 00:55:08.125
Don't remember as someone

00:55:09.365 --> 00:55:12.366
who tried to separate you two

00:55:13.525 --> 00:55:15.445
and make you feel bad.

00:55:18.285 --> 00:55:20.085
I've never seen you that way.

00:55:29.522 --> 00:55:30.523
Pin.

00:55:57.215 --> 00:55:58.325
What is it?

00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:01.645
Why do you want all of us here?

00:56:02.445 --> 00:56:05.205
Our family need to talk to your family

00:56:05.446 --> 00:56:06.747
about something, honestly.

00:56:09.685 --> 00:56:11.386
It seems to be something huge.

00:56:11.725 --> 00:56:14.965
You made it sound so scary.

00:56:15.845 --> 00:56:17.746
Pin, go on.

00:56:19.165 --> 00:56:21.445
- Go on about what?
- Come on.

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:24.325
Say that you feel trapped

00:56:24.885 --> 00:56:26.725
that you are used. Come on.

00:56:35.055 --> 00:56:38.205
She is sad and she is mad

00:56:39.205 --> 00:56:41.525
that she was a fool for marrying Prince Saenkaew.

00:56:43.085 --> 00:56:44.925
When Prince Saenkaew

00:56:47.485 --> 00:56:48.725
doesn't even like women.

00:56:53.642 --> 00:56:54.965
Khunying Wad?

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.805
Someone warned us about this

00:56:58.405 --> 00:57:00.205
but we ignored it.

00:57:00.765 --> 00:57:04.245
Because we trusted in

00:57:05.015 --> 00:57:06.965
Chansaeng's pride.

00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:11.245
We couldn't believe that you would fool us like this.

00:57:12.005 --> 00:57:13.802
We have photos as evidence.

00:57:14.242 --> 00:57:17.345
They are photos of Prince Saenkaew

00:57:18.645 --> 00:57:20.246
kissing his lover

00:57:20.846 --> 00:57:23.165
and he is Sasin, Pin's cousin.

00:57:25.645 --> 00:57:27.405
What do you want us to do?

00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:30.485
He needs to divorce Pin as soon as possible.

00:57:31.405 --> 00:57:34.485
And assets that are registered under her name

00:57:35.755 --> 00:57:37.965
will be preserved for her only.

00:57:38.805 --> 00:57:41.248
They will be considered as compensation for my girl.

00:57:41.365 --> 00:57:44.045
- Don't you think it's way too much?
- Obviously not.

00:57:44.805 --> 00:57:47.485
Comparing to humiliation that I received.

00:57:48.005 --> 00:57:49.845
But if you refused to do so,

00:57:50.348 --> 00:57:51.445
then it's fine.

00:57:51.925 --> 00:57:55.005
I'll send the photos to all newspapers

00:57:55.095 --> 00:57:56.365
in Thailand and Chansaeng.

00:57:57.125 --> 00:57:58.485
People will find out about

00:57:58.828 --> 00:58:01.325
that Prince Saenkaew, the only son of Prince Kamfah,

00:58:01.725 --> 00:58:02.926
is a homosexual.

00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:07.127
You can't do that.

00:58:09.005 --> 00:58:10.905
Sure, why can't I?

00:58:11.725 --> 00:58:13.325
For my one and only daughter

00:58:13.525 --> 00:58:14.726
of course I can do anything.

00:58:15.605 --> 00:58:19.445
Show them to Prince Kamfah and Princess Sridara.

00:58:19.645 --> 00:58:21.405
Show them how humiliated they are.

00:58:23.245 --> 00:58:24.725
There're no more photos.

00:58:25.925 --> 00:58:26.926
What?

00:58:27.405 --> 00:58:29.445
I burned them all, photos and negative.

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.685
Pin! You bitch!

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:35.445
Saenkaew is a good person and he is my good husband.

00:58:35.765 --> 00:58:38.125
I can't let both of you hurt him like that.

00:58:38.566 --> 00:58:39.765
Pin! You ungrateful child!

00:58:40.302 --> 00:58:42.645
- Give me back my photos and negative!
- Let her go!

00:58:43.845 --> 00:58:45.205
Don't touch my wife.

00:58:46.642 --> 00:58:47.643
Let's go.

00:58:48.975 --> 00:58:51.515
Pin! Come back here!

00:58:51.905 --> 00:58:54.125
- Pin!
- I've heard enough.

00:58:55.475 --> 00:58:59.045
You don't care about our families' relation.

00:59:00.365 --> 00:59:03.046
You made something up without any proof.

00:59:04.565 --> 00:59:08.765
I need to cut ties with Sirichalalai Palace from now on.

00:59:09.925 --> 00:59:10.926
Kamsu!

00:59:12.165 --> 00:59:13.166
Yes, sir!

00:59:13.402 --> 00:59:14.403
Pack up!

00:59:15.365 --> 00:59:18.085
We will leave this place right now.

00:59:18.725 --> 00:59:20.845
And we will not come back here ever again.

00:59:36.688 --> 00:59:37.845
What should we do?

00:59:38.845 --> 00:59:41.085
Kamfah ends the relationship with us.

00:59:41.422 --> 00:59:43.165
We will have nothing left.

00:59:48.302 --> 00:59:51.475
But everything is still under Pin's name.

00:59:54.805 --> 00:59:57.365
We need to make Prince Saenkaew disappear.

00:59:57.715 --> 00:59:58.716
What do you mean?

00:59:59.205 --> 01:00:01.965
The only way out is to get rid of Prince Saenkaew.

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:05.126
Get rid of?

01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:10.605
You're gonna kill him.

01:00:11.805 --> 01:00:13.645
If he dies now,

01:00:14.105 --> 01:00:15.925
everything will belong to his wife.

01:00:17.165 --> 01:00:20.205
Then we can pressure that crazy girl later

01:00:20.405 --> 01:00:21.685
to transfer everything to us.

01:00:22.725 --> 01:00:24.445
But it's too risky.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:26.685
What if somebody caught us?

01:00:26.885 --> 01:00:28.245
Don't let anyone catch us.

01:00:28.965 --> 01:00:30.725
We need to do it before they find out,

01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:32.705
and transfer all assets.

01:00:43.362 --> 01:00:44.468
I bought this house

01:00:45.062 --> 01:00:47.085
from my friend many years ago.

01:00:47.925 --> 01:00:49.826
Even before I moved from Chansaeng.

01:00:50.845 --> 01:00:53.805
So that I have a place to stay
when I come to Bangkok for business.

01:00:55.165 --> 01:00:57.725
The house is so cool and lovely.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:12.165
I'm sorry for my dad, he caused a scene yesterday.

01:01:14.205 --> 01:01:15.206
It's okay.

01:01:20.165 --> 01:01:21.285
About Saenkaew,

01:01:23.582 --> 01:01:24.905
I really appreciate you.

01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:27.565
Don't you worry.

01:01:28.765 --> 01:01:31.005
I won't leave him for sure.

01:01:32.128 --> 01:01:33.365
Thank you so much.

01:01:34.962 --> 01:01:36.705
We'll go back to Chiang Mai tomorrow

01:01:37.845 --> 01:01:40.245
and we won't have to deal with this craziness ever again.

01:01:48.615 --> 01:01:50.446
Your dad planned to hurt Saenkaew?

01:01:51.405 --> 01:01:53.125
I'm afraid it's more than hurting him.

01:01:54.365 --> 01:01:55.965
He really needs money

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:58.167
and that money is under my name.

01:02:00.725 --> 01:02:04.726
I will protect him, I won't let anyone hurt him.

01:02:07.362 --> 01:02:08.363
Sasin,

01:02:10.188 --> 01:02:11.189
I think

01:02:11.725 --> 01:02:14.245
it's time for both of you to decide to do something about it.

01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:25.765
The train will leave at 12:30 PM.

01:02:26.102 --> 01:02:28.125
Sasin will wait at Bangkok Noi Station.

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:33.805
But our train to Chiang Mai will leave at 6:00 PM.

01:02:34.605 --> 01:02:38.206
What should we do to distract his dad from this?

01:02:44.445 --> 01:02:47.942
I'll distract Kamfah.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.349
Pin,

01:02:49.405 --> 01:02:52.725
you need to take him to see Sasin as soon as possible.

01:02:56.082 --> 01:02:57.083
Grandma?

01:02:59.885 --> 01:03:01.405
Don't worry about me.

01:03:10.085 --> 01:03:11.405
I don't know if we will meet again

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:15.285
after being apart this time.

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:21.005
I will miss you so much.

01:03:22.948 --> 01:03:26.325
The most important thing is that.

01:03:27.445 --> 01:03:30.045
I know

01:03:30.646 --> 01:03:32.561
my beloved grandson

01:03:33.325 --> 01:03:37.126
will live his life happily.

01:03:53.948 --> 01:03:56.085
I will take care of her.

01:03:57.205 --> 01:03:58.805
Don't you worry.

01:03:59.922 --> 01:04:00.755
Thank you so much.

01:04:05.085 --> 01:04:06.325
You need to start packing now.

01:04:17.355 --> 01:04:18.356
Sir?

01:04:31.495 --> 01:04:32.485
Please wait.

01:04:45.762 --> 01:04:47.462
Your dad wanted me to ask

01:04:47.922 --> 01:04:49.595
if you'd like anything from Bang Lamphu.

01:04:51.565 --> 01:04:53.366
He told the maids to buy many kinds of chili paste

01:04:53.566 --> 01:04:54.845
back to Chiang Mai.

01:04:55.605 --> 01:04:56.606
It's okay.

01:04:57.205 --> 01:04:58.405
I need to pack.

01:05:06.732 --> 01:05:07.733
Grandma?

01:05:27.555 --> 01:05:28.556
Sasin.

01:05:30.045 --> 01:05:32.525
You're about to leave. I'm gonna miss you.

01:05:33.105 --> 01:05:34.106
Can I have a hug?

01:05:37.095 --> 01:05:40.285
So dramatic. He's not leaving here to die.

01:05:43.605 --> 01:05:45.565
Don't forget about us. Good luck.

01:05:45.862 --> 01:05:47.285
How could I forget about you?

01:05:49.015 --> 01:05:50.016
Good luck, pal.

01:05:53.148 --> 01:05:55.125
See? You just scolded me.

01:05:55.365 --> 01:05:56.645
You're getting sad too.

01:05:56.788 --> 01:05:57.789
You're hugging him so tight.

01:05:59.068 --> 01:06:00.069
Good luck.

01:06:00.405 --> 01:06:01.561
I'm happy for you.

01:06:02.105 --> 01:06:03.905
You will finally be with the one you love.

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:07.405
Even though you have to hide and run away,

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:10.305
it doesn't mean that your love is wrong.

01:06:13.028 --> 01:06:14.045
Thank you so much, everyone.

01:06:15.685 --> 01:06:18.725
Thank you for helping me until now.

01:06:20.228 --> 01:06:21.229
Really appreciate it.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:33.256
Madame?

01:06:33.895 --> 01:06:35.045
You want some mangoes today?

01:06:49.895 --> 01:06:52.205
Just pick the ones you like.

01:07:04.902 --> 01:07:07.005
A thief?

01:07:09.708 --> 01:07:10.645
I'm not a thief.

01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:15.765
How can she steal my produce every day?

01:07:16.648 --> 01:07:17.649
I'll catch you!

01:08:55.388 --> 01:08:58.005
I think we should call a taxi far from here.

01:08:58.245 --> 01:09:00.325
It's not safe around here. They can see us.

01:09:17.802 --> 01:09:19.965
To Bangkok Noi train station. Please hurry.

01:09:20.235 --> 01:09:21.725
Don't you worry.

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:24.565
It's less than 15 minutes from here.

01:09:25.575 --> 01:09:26.576
Let's go.

01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:37.765
You packed up everything from my office.

01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:41.885
There are a few things left, sir.

01:09:42.725 --> 01:09:45.445
I'm not sure if you'd work on the train.

01:09:47.005 --> 01:09:48.305
Okay, I'll go pack them up myself.

01:09:50.168 --> 01:09:51.805
We don’t need to leave anything here.

01:09:52.565 --> 01:09:55.905
We won't come back for many years.

01:09:59.085 --> 01:10:01.245
Are you sure about moving to Chansaeng?

01:10:06.075 --> 01:10:07.085
Why're you asking?

01:10:08.525 --> 01:10:09.765
It's our hometown.

01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:12.205
I don't trust Kalong.

01:10:14.005 --> 01:10:15.405
There is nothing left for you to say.

01:10:16.595 --> 01:10:17.935
I've thought this through.

01:10:25.748 --> 01:10:28.485
Are you blind or something?

01:10:28.602 --> 01:10:30.205
See? All my things are damaged.

01:10:31.388 --> 01:10:33.905
Auntie, I drove like normal people.

01:10:34.165 --> 01:10:37.085
But your bike cut right in front of me.

01:10:37.268 --> 01:10:39.125
Cut in front of you what?

01:10:39.202 --> 01:10:40.765
We were going straight.

01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:44.085
- Can't you wait when you're about to turn?
- I was waiting.

01:10:44.135 --> 01:10:45.605
But he rode too slow.

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.805
I couldn't measure the distance.
You got problems with that?

01:10:48.365 --> 01:10:51.005
How could you ask me that? Look at my products.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:54.125
How are you gonna pay me back?
These are my products to sell.

01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:56.423
Hey! You two need to wrap it up,

01:10:57.165 --> 01:10:59.525
- so others can go on about their lives.
- None of your business.

01:11:00.848 --> 01:11:02.849
Where're you going? You son of a bitch!

01:11:02.955 --> 01:11:03.956
Come back here.

01:11:04.442 --> 01:11:06.925
What should we do? It's almost noon.

01:11:15.685 --> 01:11:17.186
That is Prince Saenkaew.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.209
Saenkaew?

01:11:22.525 --> 01:11:23.526
Nope.

01:11:26.645 --> 01:11:27.925
You need to wear glasses for real.

01:11:29.246 --> 01:11:30.445
It's noon already.

01:11:30.645 --> 01:11:32.746
Why aren't they here?

01:11:33.965 --> 01:11:35.205
Or they can't get out of the house?

01:11:39.335 --> 01:11:41.905
- Where're you going? Come back here.
- None of your business!

01:11:42.162 --> 01:11:43.163
Catch him!

01:11:45.362 --> 01:11:47.005
They're fighting for real!

01:11:56.362 --> 01:11:57.645
It's noon. What should we do?

01:11:58.048 --> 01:11:59.285
Looks like it's gonna be long.

01:11:59.885 --> 01:12:02.305
Should we walk?

01:12:03.565 --> 01:12:05.085
There's a shortcut this way.

01:12:05.445 --> 01:12:07.245
You can walk through their orchards for a little while

01:12:07.445 --> 01:12:09.446
and it'll lead you to the front of the station.

01:12:12.725 --> 01:12:13.726
Here.

01:12:17.962 --> 01:12:18.963
What the heck!

01:12:29.702 --> 01:12:31.703
I think it should be this way.

01:12:46.322 --> 01:12:47.805
I think I should look for Saenkaew.

01:12:48.245 --> 01:12:50.646
You're gonna miss him. Maybe it's the traffic.

01:12:51.565 --> 01:12:52.965
I'll be back before the train leaves.

01:12:53.245 --> 01:12:55.765
If he's here before me, tell him to wait for me.

01:12:57.645 --> 01:12:58.646
Here, hold this.

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:40.983
Dad,

01:13:41.525 --> 01:13:43.283
If you read this letter,

01:13:43.725 --> 01:13:45.165
it means that I'm not here anymore.

01:13:46.885 --> 01:13:48.605
Don't try to find me.

01:13:49.645 --> 01:13:52.846
I'm not good enough for you
to waste your time and upset about me.

01:13:53.685 --> 01:13:56.005
I'm sorry that I was born to love another man

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.525
and humiliate you.

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:00.925
My disappearance

01:14:01.366 --> 01:14:03.605
could make you happier

01:14:03.927 --> 01:14:05.965
and you can look at people without any shame.

01:14:06.365 --> 01:14:09.525
Respectfully, Saenkaew.

01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:13.516
Saenkaew!

01:14:25.382 --> 01:14:26.605
I think we're almost there.

01:14:27.565 --> 01:14:30.965
The villagers said that
this shortcut will lead to the station soon.

01:14:38.242 --> 01:14:39.243
Dad?

01:14:39.955 --> 01:14:42.165
Luck is on your side again, Saenkaew.

01:14:43.685 --> 01:14:46.245
- Pin-anong! Step back!
- No!

01:14:47.245 --> 01:14:49.325
I know that you planned to kill him.

01:14:49.928 --> 01:14:51.205
So you can seize his dad's assets.

01:14:51.725 --> 01:14:54.445
Well, you knew about it then you need to leave.
Aren't you mad at him?

01:14:55.005 --> 01:14:58.006
He fooled you, he had an affair with your cousin.

01:14:58.415 --> 01:15:00.765
Step back and let me get him for you.

01:15:03.005 --> 01:15:04.285
Don’t do it.

01:15:05.788 --> 01:15:08.905
If you need money, I can give it to you.

01:15:10.725 --> 01:15:12.405
You think I'm that stupid?

01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:15.805
You and your dad are too tricky.

01:15:16.482 --> 01:15:18.525
I won't risk it for you to fool me again.

01:15:19.605 --> 01:15:22.965
But thanks for choosing this path.

01:15:23.442 --> 01:15:25.485
It makes my job easier.

01:15:42.368 --> 01:15:43.369
Sasin!

01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:46.629
Saenkaew!

01:15:47.802 --> 01:15:49.485
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:15:55.108 --> 01:15:56.595
You love him so much?

01:15:58.942 --> 01:16:01.525
You don't care about your cousin at all?

01:16:02.525 --> 01:16:05.325
If you're gonna hurt him, over my dead body.

01:16:05.525 --> 01:16:08.405
Sure I will. You two will be dead together.

01:16:13.595 --> 01:16:14.596
Pin!

01:16:15.245 --> 01:16:16.445
If you're gonna shoot them,

01:16:17.325 --> 01:16:18.445
then you need to shoot me.

01:16:19.285 --> 01:16:22.925
Are you stupid? He doesn't love you that much.

01:16:23.455 --> 01:16:24.805
You're will to die for him?

01:16:27.685 --> 01:16:30.165
How did I raise you to be this stupid?

01:16:33.295 --> 01:16:35.405
Sasin! Saenkaew! You need to run!

01:16:39.296 --> 01:16:41.645
You think I wouldn't dare to shoot you?

01:16:42.445 --> 01:16:46.125
Just so you know, you're worthless for me.

01:16:49.108 --> 01:16:50.605
If you die,

01:16:51.765 --> 01:16:52.845
Saenkaew dies,

01:16:54.085 --> 01:16:56.165
everything will belong to me.

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:57.705
You understand?

01:17:06.075 --> 01:17:07.076
Just shoot me.

01:17:07.685 --> 01:17:08.686
Pin!

01:17:10.485 --> 01:17:11.845
Come on, shoot me!

01:17:12.735 --> 01:17:13.736
Let it go!

01:17:14.128 --> 01:17:15.165
Let it go! Now!

01:17:16.242 --> 01:17:17.243
Shoot me!

01:17:18.028 --> 01:17:19.029
Let it go!

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:22.365
Let go of your hand! Step back!

01:17:22.925 --> 01:17:25.442
- Let it go!
- No!

01:17:25.845 --> 01:17:27.645
- I won't!
- I told you to let it go.

01:17:27.705 --> 01:17:28.406
I won't!

01:17:28.885 --> 01:17:29.857
- Let go of your hand!
- No!

01:17:33.194 --> 01:17:34.788
- Don't!
- No!

01:17:35.222 --> 01:17:37.245
Stop right now!

01:17:42.902 --> 01:17:44.605
Let's go. Come on!

01:18:00.828 --> 01:18:01.765
Saenkaew!

01:18:02.925 --> 01:18:04.485
You think you can run away from me?

01:18:23.488 --> 01:18:24.489
You!

01:18:24.648 --> 01:18:27.885
You're so cruel! You killed my husband!

01:18:42.588 --> 01:18:43.589
You!

01:18:44.848 --> 01:18:46.085
You stabbed me?

01:19:26.368 --> 01:19:27.369
Honey!

01:19:29.845 --> 01:19:30.846
Honey!

01:19:41.142 --> 01:19:42.205
They're here.

01:19:43.448 --> 01:19:44.449
Hurry up.

01:19:45.194 --> 01:19:46.195
Come on!

01:19:48.928 --> 01:19:51.925
The train is about to leave, let's go.

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:56.165
I almost forgot. Here.

01:19:56.405 --> 01:19:58.705
I transferred your money
back to your bank account.

01:20:00.655 --> 01:20:01.656
Thank you.

01:20:02.365 --> 01:20:04.685
Good luck, my lovely brothers.

01:20:05.366 --> 01:20:06.885
You must live a happy life, okay?

01:20:08.283 --> 01:20:09.405
Think of me.

01:20:11.525 --> 01:20:13.105
I won't forget about you.

01:20:14.082 --> 01:20:15.083
Here.

01:20:24.365 --> 01:20:26.645
Good luck, both of you.

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:31.605
The train is leaving. Come on!

01:20:33.548 --> 01:20:34.549
Let's go.

01:20:34.805 --> 01:20:36.925
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:20:37.495 --> 01:20:38.496
Good luck!

01:20:39.022 --> 01:20:40.085
Take care!

01:20:40.528 --> 01:20:42.805
You too, take care!

01:20:43.544 --> 01:20:45.085
- Bye!
- Saenkaew!

01:20:45.645 --> 01:20:46.646
Sir?

01:20:47.205 --> 01:20:48.206
Sir!

01:20:50.942 --> 01:20:53.085
- Saenkaew! Come back!
- Sir!

01:20:53.975 --> 01:20:56.245
Be happy and enjoy life!

01:20:56.495 --> 01:20:57.496
Sir!

01:20:58.142 --> 01:20:59.725
Bye! Good luck!

01:21:04.082 --> 01:21:05.083
Saenkaew!

01:21:05.677 --> 01:21:06.678
Don't go!

01:21:07.408 --> 01:21:09.195
- Prince Saenkaew!
- Come back!

01:21:09.485 --> 01:21:10.486
Saenkaew!

01:22:27.115 --> 01:22:28.245
Saenkaew is gone.

01:22:31.162 --> 01:22:32.405
He's gone.

01:22:35.755 --> 01:22:36.805
Did you know that

01:22:38.268 --> 01:22:39.965
Saenkaew will never come back here?

01:22:46.868 --> 01:22:47.925
I know that

01:22:50.645 --> 01:22:52.165
we might never

01:22:53.205 --> 01:22:55.325
see him again.

01:22:56.125 --> 01:22:57.326
You knew?

01:23:00.802 --> 01:23:03.205
Why did you let him run away with Sasin?

01:23:04.005 --> 01:23:05.006
Why?

01:23:05.555 --> 01:23:08.765
He deserved to live his own life, not the one

01:23:09.845 --> 01:23:14.748
we designed for him to follow.

01:23:15.645 --> 01:23:17.085
But his choice

01:23:18.645 --> 01:23:22.085
will lead to sorrow and pain.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.125
You know that

01:23:25.765 --> 01:23:27.845
detaining him

01:23:28.565 --> 01:23:31.485
will only torture

01:23:31.685 --> 01:23:34.005
and sorrow him even more.

01:23:35.685 --> 01:23:37.445
But it's different.

01:23:39.045 --> 01:23:40.485
If he is with us,

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:46.325
I can still take care of him, protect him,

01:23:46.765 --> 01:23:48.845
no one will find out who he is.

01:23:51.995 --> 01:23:52.996
Now…

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:56.445
he chose to be with Sasin.

01:23:58.348 --> 01:23:59.405
You know it well that

01:24:01.095 --> 01:24:02.968
a love among someone like him

01:24:03.855 --> 01:24:05.542
will not be accepted anywhere.

01:24:07.528 --> 01:24:09.429
The whole world will judge them.

01:24:16.815 --> 01:24:19.605
If the whole world judges him,

01:24:20.685 --> 01:24:24.405
we need to stand by his side firmly.

01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:31.765
That is what family needs to do.

01:24:33.285 --> 01:24:34.286
Accept.

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.409
Understand.

01:24:37.165 --> 01:24:38.405
And stand by his side.

01:24:43.808 --> 01:24:48.445
I hope that when Saenkaew comes back,

01:24:49.365 --> 01:24:52.445
if we have a chance to meet again,

01:24:53.782 --> 01:24:56.325
you won't look at him

01:24:56.783 --> 01:25:00.255
as a son who causes disappointment to his dad,

01:25:01.205 --> 01:25:05.405
but you should look at him, as a son

01:25:05.925 --> 01:25:09.605
who is brave enough to choose his own path.

01:25:10.615 --> 01:25:14.845
You need to accept who he is.

01:25:46.165 --> 01:25:48.166
(One Year Later)

01:25:51.445 --> 01:25:53.765
(Phatthalung, 1965)

01:26:04.428 --> 01:26:05.429
Dear Pin,

01:26:06.685 --> 01:26:08.205
I'm sorry for being gone for too long.

01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:11.845
Our lives here started to follow the plan.

01:26:13.445 --> 01:26:15.365
I heard about what happened to your dad.

01:26:16.405 --> 01:26:17.406
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:21.125
I hope you stay strong like you've always been.

01:26:27.695 --> 01:26:29.696
I'm translating books and documents for

01:26:29.845 --> 01:26:32.245
people who'd like to contact Embassy of France.

01:26:35.446 --> 01:26:36.365
And Sasin,

01:26:37.565 --> 01:26:39.485
he is a music teacher now.

01:26:40.693 --> 01:26:43.805
He opens a small class at home.
The kids love him.

01:26:47.165 --> 01:26:49.245
You should see him around the kids.

01:26:49.645 --> 01:26:50.925
It's just like big monkey hanging out with the little ones.

01:26:51.735 --> 01:26:52.885
But we're happy.

01:26:53.848 --> 01:26:56.525
- I'm gonna fight a monster.
- You're fighting back?

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.685
Follow me!

01:26:59.865 --> 01:27:01.005
- Here!
- Follow me!

01:27:01.155 --> 01:27:02.356
How're you gonna fight?

01:27:04.335 --> 01:27:06.115
You're almost done?

01:27:06.285 --> 01:27:07.286
Almost done.

01:27:09.128 --> 01:27:10.445
Our lives are quite simple

01:27:11.205 --> 01:27:12.885
but they're so meaningful.

01:27:14.206 --> 01:27:16.645
I know that this is not a life everyone has dreamed of

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:21.045
but for us, this is truly freedom.

01:27:21.688 --> 01:27:23.245
What is that?

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:25.406
You don't like?

01:27:29.806 --> 01:27:31.725
Without your help,

01:27:32.965 --> 01:27:35.045
we wouldn't have had a chance
to spend this kind of life.

01:27:40.045 --> 01:27:41.565
Send my best wishes to everyone.

01:27:42.965 --> 01:27:44.666
I attached my address at the end of this letter.

01:27:45.595 --> 01:27:49.125
If you're free, please come and visit us.

01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:52.709
Love and miss you always.

01:27:53.522 --> 01:27:54.523
Saenkaew.

01:28:34.982 --> 01:28:36.525
A letter from Prince Saenkaew?

01:28:38.582 --> 01:28:39.583
Yes.

01:28:40.965 --> 01:28:43.805
He said that he's happy

01:28:44.435 --> 01:28:46.445
and he seems really happy.

01:28:48.285 --> 01:28:49.525
At least,

01:28:50.285 --> 01:28:52.605
he looks happier than he was with me.

01:28:54.002 --> 01:28:55.003
Pin?

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:59.325
I'm fine, not sad.

01:29:00.285 --> 01:29:03.485
I'm glad to see them happy.

01:29:12.115 --> 01:29:14.325
This is true love.

01:29:15.645 --> 01:29:17.485
Sometimes to see someone we love

01:29:18.005 --> 01:29:20.205
live his life like he wanted, to be happy,

01:29:21.445 --> 01:29:24.525
it could be greater gift than owning him.

01:29:27.802 --> 01:29:30.203
I used to believe that there is a happy ending,

01:29:31.925 --> 01:29:35.045
a prince and a princess

01:29:35.255 --> 01:29:37.856
stay together eternally.

01:29:40.245 --> 01:29:41.765
Now I know

01:29:42.605 --> 01:29:44.305
that to see them happy

01:29:45.668 --> 01:29:47.245
is enough, for real.

01:29:49.262 --> 01:29:51.165
We all have our own paths

01:29:52.725 --> 01:29:54.765
when we can accept this face

01:29:56.245 --> 01:29:58.346
happiness will start.

01:30:23.435 --> 01:30:24.685
What're you doing out here?

01:30:26.125 --> 01:30:27.165
It still rains.

01:30:29.526 --> 01:30:30.527
Nothing.

01:30:31.685 --> 01:30:32.765
Just thinking this and that.

01:30:37.162 --> 01:30:38.201
Thinking of Pin,

01:30:41.595 --> 01:30:42.596
thinking of Dad,

01:30:45.135 --> 01:30:46.136
thinking of Grandma.

01:30:49.336 --> 01:30:51.605
You're not thinking of me?

01:30:54.137 --> 01:30:57.645
Come on! I'm so sick of seeing your face.

01:30:57.788 --> 01:31:00.285
Hey! Don't get sick of me yet.

01:31:03.205 --> 01:31:04.365
I've never thought that

01:31:05.855 --> 01:31:06.885
we would have nights like these.

01:31:08.668 --> 01:31:10.805
That we can look at the moon together,

01:31:13.235 --> 01:31:14.365
and we don't have to hide,

01:31:15.725 --> 01:31:16.726
or be scared of anyone.

01:31:26.682 --> 01:31:27.883
But for me,

01:31:29.205 --> 01:31:31.245
since I found out that I've fallen in love with you,

01:31:33.806 --> 01:31:35.847
I always pictured us like this.

01:31:37.205 --> 01:31:38.285
Looking at the moon together

01:31:39.322 --> 01:31:40.565
and living together.

01:31:43.725 --> 01:31:45.326
Well, you're a dreamer.

01:31:49.628 --> 01:31:50.629
But…

01:31:51.535 --> 01:31:52.536
thank you

01:31:53.645 --> 01:31:55.645
for teaching me to believe in dreams.

01:31:57.605 --> 01:31:58.606
Otherwise,

01:31:59.325 --> 01:32:01.226
I wouldn't have enough courage to fight,

01:32:03.765 --> 01:32:04.855
and to love you.

01:32:09.885 --> 01:32:11.125
But

01:32:12.325 --> 01:32:14.105
I still have one dream.

01:32:14.725 --> 01:32:15.726
What is it?

01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:18.445
I have a dream that

01:32:19.168 --> 01:32:22.445
tonight we will…

01:32:27.995 --> 01:32:30.915
What kind of dream is that?

01:32:31.405 --> 01:32:32.905
Go ahead and do it yourself.

01:32:35.885 --> 01:32:39.925
Well, I want to turn my dream into reality.

01:32:40.635 --> 01:32:41.636
Hey!

01:32:42.275 --> 01:32:43.276
What?

01:32:45.368 --> 01:32:46.628
What is it?

01:32:50.405 --> 01:32:52.645
You wanted me to cook you grilled beef late at night?

01:32:53.085 --> 01:32:56.486
- Who'd do that?
- Please? I want to eat some.

01:32:56.765 --> 01:33:00.725
- I'm hungry. Please.
- Hey! Stop!

01:33:14.445 --> 01:33:15.805
Is anybody there?

01:33:17.405 --> 01:33:18.855
Can I get a glass of water?

01:33:27.828 --> 01:33:28.829
Kamsu?

01:33:30.175 --> 01:33:31.176
Kamsu?

01:33:39.125 --> 01:33:40.165
Pin, is that you?

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.605
How did you get here?

01:33:43.882 --> 01:33:47.735
I heard that you're sick
so I came here to see you.

01:33:52.248 --> 01:33:53.405
Thank you.

01:33:54.915 --> 01:33:56.245
You came all the way to Chiang Mai.

01:33:57.242 --> 01:33:58.765
You're here by yourself?

01:33:59.795 --> 01:34:00.805
Not really.

01:34:01.645 --> 01:34:04.746
Someone would like to see you too.

01:34:20.365 --> 01:34:21.366
Saenkaew?

01:34:26.125 --> 01:34:27.126
Dad.

01:34:34.405 --> 01:34:35.406
Saenkaew?

01:34:39.103 --> 01:34:40.104
Dad.

01:34:40.848 --> 01:34:41.915
I'm sorry.

01:35:06.925 --> 01:35:07.926
He's here too?

01:35:20.182 --> 01:35:21.325
How many days are you going to stay?

01:35:23.708 --> 01:35:25.125
We booked a hotel for three nights, sir.

01:35:29.008 --> 01:35:30.925
Why did you stay at the hotel?

01:35:32.555 --> 01:35:33.556
We have a house here.

01:35:40.008 --> 01:35:41.285
Stay here.

01:35:43.515 --> 01:35:45.516
I'll ask Homthip to arrange something for you.

01:35:56.325 --> 01:35:57.326
Thank you, sir.

01:36:00.885 --> 01:36:02.165
Thank you, Dad.

01:36:30.182 --> 01:36:31.925
- Thank you.
- Saenkaew.

01:36:33.005 --> 01:36:35.205
- Come here and sit by my side.
- Okay.

01:36:39.915 --> 01:36:42.765
Pin, you should be in here too. Come on.

01:36:50.415 --> 01:36:52.845
Sir? Can you put your arm around your son's shoulder?

01:36:54.595 --> 01:36:55.596
Sure.

01:36:56.605 --> 01:36:57.606
Smile.

01:36:59.415 --> 01:37:00.416
Smile, okay?

01:37:01.245 --> 01:37:02.705
1..2..3

01:37:04.675 --> 01:37:06.605
I think you should sit in the middle,

01:37:06.755 --> 01:37:07.756
Pin too.

01:37:13.522 --> 01:37:14.523
So good.

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:19.205
I don't think they should be in the middle.

01:37:19.835 --> 01:37:21.605
The same position was good already.

01:37:23.528 --> 01:37:24.565
So true.

01:37:27.182 --> 01:37:28.183
You think so?

01:37:30.142 --> 01:37:31.565
- Sure.
- Look at the camera.

01:37:32.715 --> 01:37:34.485
Where should he in in this? Standing or sitting down.

01:37:39.782 --> 01:37:41.485
You want me in the family portrait?

01:37:43.445 --> 01:37:45.205
If you don't want to, just stand there.

01:37:45.565 --> 01:37:46.566
Suit yourself.

01:37:49.395 --> 01:37:51.002
Sure, I want to be in there.

01:37:51.608 --> 01:37:52.609
Come on, get in there.

01:37:59.362 --> 01:38:00.363
Ready?

01:38:01.015 --> 01:38:02.016
Wait.

01:38:12.668 --> 01:38:15.925
The kids should be in the back, let's go.

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:23.005
Good. Now smile!

01:38:24.575 --> 01:38:26.165
Smile so big!

01:38:26.608 --> 01:38:28.609
1..2..3

01:38:30.708 --> 01:38:33.285
Homthip and Kamsu, you need to be in this too.

01:38:33.342 --> 01:38:34.343
Come here.

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:38.365
You two are family. Come on.

01:38:38.635 --> 01:38:39.636
Sure.

01:38:44.162 --> 01:38:46.725
Smile everybody. Smile so bright!

01:38:57.748 --> 01:38:59.445
1..2..3

01:39:00.442 --> 01:39:03.085
Perfect. One more time!

01:39:04.062 --> 01:39:05.925
1..2..3

01:39:16.085 --> 01:39:18.086
The End.
