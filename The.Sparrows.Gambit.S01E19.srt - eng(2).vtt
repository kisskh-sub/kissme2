From now on, you should call me Mother.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.740
What are you talking about?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.380
I didn't know

Don't be rude.

From now on,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.340
she is Mrs. Chen.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.140
Your stepmother.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.660
Dad...

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.820
Wan'er has had it rough

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.740
with a father like Wang Penghui.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.540
That little girl used to trail after me,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.140
I just couldn't leave her like that.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.020
Since you broke off the engagement,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.580
I have to take responsibility for her.

My Marshal,

I wanted to properly welcome Miss Liu

I know what happened before.

It was all Wang Penghui's doing.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.940
Wan'er was a victim too.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.380
You all need to be the bigger people.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.060

You really think it's all over now?

My dad was nothing but a butler.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.900
You think he has that kind of pull?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.580
What did you just say?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.700
I was just helping wipe your shoes.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.220
Why make such a scene?

Hurry, get the doctor!

your wife is not yet three months along.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.540
Do not upset her again, no matter what.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.020
She almost miscarried just now.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.780

I know what you
and Miss Liu are digging into.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.540
But if someone got a shady past,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.820
there's no way I'm letting her in.

I need to tell you one more thing.

Miss Liu is smart enough,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.380
but she married Wang Penghui

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.740
