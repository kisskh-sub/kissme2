DEAR X

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.390
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.310
Your husband...

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:34.844
Sung-hee.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:54.883
Baek Ah-jin!

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.844
Ah-jin!

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.686
EPISODE 11: SAVE ME, MY GOD

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.902
Don't worry about anything
and get some more sleep.

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:49.979
Yesterday afternoon,
actress Baek Ah-jin was attacked

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.650
by her high school classmate,
Ms. Sim, who claimed to be a fan.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.818
Baek was taken to the hospital
for treatment.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:59.364
- While her life is not in danger...
- Sim Sung-hee. That bitch.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:02.575
...she is said to be suffering
severe psychological shock.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.785
Bitch!

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.287
The assailant, Sim,
suffers from schizophrenia

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.705
and has been receiving...

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.292
Actress Baek Ah-jin was attacked
by a female fan the same age as her.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.002
What do you make of this?

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.337
It says the assailant was Sim

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.673
a former classmate
who suffers from schizophrenia.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.049
And as soon as I read that

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:22.178
a case from 2023 that briefly
made headlines came to mind.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.429
What case was that?

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.598
There was a classmate
who used the nickname "Simsim."

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.017
She posted an exposé on Ah-jin's past

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.811
only to delete it immediately.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.688
Don't you smell something fishy?

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.773
- It smells very fishy.
- So it's not just me.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.660
Yes, Ah-jin.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:49.664
Other than the injured area,
the doctor says you're doing fine.

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:53.001
As for your movie,
I've coordinated things

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.586
so you can resume filming
once you've healed.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.671
Are you okay with that?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.299
It's not a serious injury.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:04.053
If I take too much time off,
it'll only create unnecessary rumors.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.472
I'll get back to work
after a short break.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.642
About the crazy woman
who attacked you...

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.104
The police requested
a psychiatric evaluation

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.356
and the diagnosis was schizophrenia.

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:20.028
She'll be kept in a mental hospital,
so you won't have to see her again.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.697
That's a relief.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:26.326
So don't worry about anything now.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.286
Just rest.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.496
I'll take care of everything.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.498
Okay?

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:34.500
Thank you.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.128
I feel a bit more at ease,
thanks to you.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.341
Good.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:43.843
Let's talk again later.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.730
I guess she misses me.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:06.240
If you undergo laser treatment
every three to four weeks

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:09.202
the scar should become
barely noticeable over time.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.204
The procedure takes
around 15 minutes.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.791
Just relax your body
and stay comfortable.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.602
I found Sim Sung-hee.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.230
The classmate who stabbed your broom.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.898
Here.

00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:45.905
What happened to the reporter
who spread weird rumors on YouTube?

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:49.033
That's the thing. I looked into him.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.161
But ever since that stream,
he's vanished without a trace.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.663
Might've even left the country.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.124
What? When did he disappear?

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.626
The day he live-streamed on YouTube.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.711
And check this out.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.381
Sim Sung-hee is being held
at Haemil Hospital.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.508
You know Do-hyuk's ex-wife?

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.386
She was admitted
to that same hospital

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:10.847
after their divorce.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.601
Wait a minute.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.480
If I go to this Haemil place,
can I meet his ex-wife?

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.566
I'm afraid not.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:25.069
No one's seen her
at the hospital for about a year.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.239
So she's missing.
Gone without a trace.

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:30.074
Pretty much.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:31.951
I pulled a few days' worth

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.787
of security footage
from Haemil Hospital.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.956
I gave it a quick scan,
but nothing stood out.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.877
NURSING RECORDS
NAME: SIM SUNG-HEE

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.300
MOON DO-HYUK, CEO OF SATURN

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.261
MOON PULLS OFF
ANOTHER MAJOR ACQUISITION

00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:53.389
KNOWN FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE M&A STRATEGY
ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.057
HE RECENTLY ACQUIRED HAEMIL HOSPITAL

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.843
What the hell is he doing there?

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.554
Have you thought about
what you want to do next?

00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:37.475
Not yet. I'm planning
to think things through.

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:40.394
Good. You've got plenty of time.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:47.693
To be honest,
I never liked you writing books.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.030
People say that
artists starve for a reason.

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:53.241
You might get lucky
and write a bestseller

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.910
but there's no guarantee
it'll keep selling.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.828
I think the same.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.334
I've been cooped up at home
for too long.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.712
Let's finish this
and get some fresh air.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.219
Jun-seo.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:17.723
Help me out here.
Which one looks better on me?

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.728
I think they both suit you.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:23.813
Really?

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.569
It's exhausting
when everything looks good on me.

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.530
Having to choose is so tough.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.411
We'll take both of these.

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:39.495
Sure.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.958
I'll ring you up.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.796
- He must be your son.
- He is.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.549
You two look so sweet.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.342
Thank you.

00:09:55.052 --> 00:09:57.638
I never thought I'd see the day
my son spoils me like this.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.266
Are you finally
trying to be a good son?

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:03.060
You seem to be in a good mood.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.688
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.441
I knew you'd come back eventually.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:10.568
You were just under her spell.

00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:13.946
If not for that,
we would've gotten along just fine.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.031
Don't you agree?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.491
Do you honestly believe that?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.743
Of course, I do.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.039
Wait. Aren't you Mr. Yoon Seok-ha,
the author?

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.376
I'm Han Ji-gyu, a producer.

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:31.339
I've been trying to reach you,
but I couldn't get through.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.549
I can't believe I ran into you here.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:39.555
If you're done shopping,
may I have a moment of your time?

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.015
It won't take long.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.352
- I'm here with someone right now--
- Son.

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.647
I'm fine,
so go ahead and talk to him.

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.857
He must be desperate
if he's doing this

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.567
in the middle of a department store.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.403
I'll leave you two alone.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.697
Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.617
See you at home.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.623
I'm a big fan of your work,
Co-Offender Y.

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:08.417
How did you write something like that
at such a young age?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.002
I was very impressed.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.047
Every character in that book
has such depth.

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:16.634
But while reading your book

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:21.013
I couldn't help thinking
of the rumors about an actress.

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:23.391
- Rumors?
- Yes.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:27.895
Recently, there have been rumors
about actress Baek Ah-jin.

00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:32.733
You know she was recently attacked
by a high school classmate, right?

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:35.444
Hold on. She was attacked?

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.738
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:41.826
She wasn't seriously injured,
but the shoot had to be put on hold.

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:46.747
Anyway, after that attack,
rumors about her went viral.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:52.712
Here.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.547
THE SCARY TRUTH BEHIND TOP STAR B

00:11:56.215 --> 00:12:00.177
Your book lines up perfectly
with these rumors.

00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:06.183
So I wanted to ask whether your book
was based on a true story.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.107
If it's actually about Baek Ah-jin

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.943
we're considering covering it
on our show.

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:20.906
I'm sorry,
but that book is purely fiction.

00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:23.868
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.746
Please wait.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.878
Was Ah-jin really attacked?

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:35.671
Did you just find out?

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.840
Is that why you called me?

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.675
It's in hundreds of articles already.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:43.471
Why are you asking me
when you're the one who ghosted me?

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:44.722
She's not badly hurt, is she?

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.307
Are you worried about her?

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.642
If you really want to know,
ask me in person.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.491
RUMOR HAS IT THAT TOP STAR B

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.951
HAS SHOWN SOCIOPATHIC TENDENCIES
SINCE CHILDHOOD

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:09.663
SHE MANIPULATES THOSE AROUND HER
TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.250
THE SCARY TRUTH BEHIND TOP STAR B

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.481
Ma'am?

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:38.901
Do you need something?

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.947
I have a bad headache.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.575
If I ask for alcohol,
you won't give me any.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:50.079
So could you make me
a cup of tea instead?

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:53.666
I'll prepare it right away.

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:09.056
How many people have died
because of her?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.892
She deserved to get stabbed.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.602
Shameless bitch.

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.197
Ma'am, are you all right?

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.658
Here's your warm herbal tea.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.918
Right. Thank you.

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:06.614
I was just drinking tea.

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:05.774
Ma'am.

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:09.653
Why are all the doors broken?

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.867
The kitchen was a mess, too.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.456
Don't you remember?

00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:22.416
Remember what?

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.002
The doors to the study
and the kitchen...

00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:27.880
You're the one who did that.

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.716
What are you talking about?

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.302
Do you really not remember?

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:37.222
You don't remember
a single thing you did?

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:27.022
She kept saying she wanted to kill me

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.357
so I divorced her.

00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:34.446
Eventually,
she had a complete breakdown.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.450
Now she's being treated
in a psychiatric hospital.

00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:45.958
Maybe I treated her too well,
above her place.

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:04.434
Ma'am.

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:06.687
Ma'am.

00:19:08.438 --> 00:19:11.900
Would you like to go
to the hospital with me?

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.113
Do I look insane to you?

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:19.992
No, that's not what I meant--

00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:21.076
I must have...

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:24.997
I must have drunk too much.

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:28.375
I must have blacked out.

00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:30.502
It's nothing serious.

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:34.506
So I don't need
to go to the hospital.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.799
Don't worry.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:40.429
I won't lose my mind.

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.268
I told you.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.146
I'm not like her.

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:50.772
I'm different.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:54.651
So don't mention
the hospital ever again.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.112
You can tell Do-hyuk

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:01.283
that I got drunk and made a mistake.

00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:03.202
That's what happened.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.828
Understood?

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:05.913
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.992
INCOMING CALL

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:05.555
INCOMING CALL

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:38.422
Ah-jin, are you okay?

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:41.800
I was really worried
after reading the articles.

00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:46.096
I'm so glad you're back on set
and filming again.

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:48.307
Thank you for worrying about me.

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:51.143
I'm so excited for this film.

00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:54.438
With everything that's happened,
this might be our big break.

00:21:55.522 --> 00:21:56.648
See you later!

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.991
Lord.

00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:08.201
I spent...

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.874
every day drowning in my own tears.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:17.461
I tried to let it all go

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.297
to forgive and move on.

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:25.135
Yet he lived on.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.804
And I...

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:32.601
was left to suffer
in this agonizing Hell.

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:36.938
Is this

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:40.609
your answer?

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:02.547
Boss.

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:14.393
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.186
You called me.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.941
What do you mean, I called you?

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.111
Wait.

00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:26.530
You seriously don't remember?

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:29.074
What did I say on the phone?

00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:32.619
You were really anxious.

00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:34.830
You said everything felt wrong
and that you needed help.

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.416
You said Do-hyuk
was doing something to you

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.209
but you didn't know what exactly.

00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:42.421
Do-hyuk was doing something to me?

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:50.011
I don't remember saying that.

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:55.934
Ah-jin.

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:57.978
Are you okay?

00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:03.817
Everything you're going through...
The nightmares, the memory loss...

00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.736
This is clearly connected to Do-hyuk.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.947
I'm sure of it. This is his doing.

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:12.367
I looked into his ex-wife.

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:14.494
She lost her mind after marrying him

00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:17.247
and ended up in a mental hospital
after the divorce.

00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:19.624
Now, she's missing.

00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:22.627
- She's missing?
- Yes.

00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:25.046
I also looked into Sung-hee.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.174
A few days before she attacked you

00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:29.593
she told people
she suddenly had a lot of money.

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:33.263
She even bragged
that she had met Do-hyuk.

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:37.559
What are you saying?

00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:44.107
Sung-hee met Do-hyuk
before attacking me?

00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:46.860
Do you know
which mental hospital she's in?

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.531
Haemil Hospital.

00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:55.952
Do-hyuk acquired it a few years ago.

00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:57.662
You think that's all a coincidence?

00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:59.206
But Ah-jin...

00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:04.878
Do you think your marriage is
a blessing or a curse?

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:07.339
Your husband...

00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:13.303
So what if it isn't a coincidence?

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.306
What am I supposed to do?

00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:19.059
Divorce him?

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:20.852
I can't.

00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:22.938
I won't.

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.731
Why not? Why won't you?

00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:27.359
- You could be in danger--
- Do you know what I did

00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:28.944
to get here?

00:25:29.402 --> 00:25:31.780
Everything I have,
I fought for with everything in me.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.698
If I divorce him,
it all comes crashing down.

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.158
You want me to go back?

00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:38.328
Back to people throwing eggs
and pointing fingers?

00:25:38.411 --> 00:25:39.913
- Ah-jin.
- No.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.167
No. I don't want that.

00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.586
Why do I always have to suffer?

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.630
Why only me?

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:52.384
Why do I have to suffer?

00:25:54.594 --> 00:25:56.721
All right. I understand.

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.692
I just want to live.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.950
I want to protect
everything I've achieved.

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:19.411
I don't want to lose...

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:23.164
any of it.

00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:26.543
Okay.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.130
I'll help you.

00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:36.261
Look at me.

00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.306
If divorce isn't an option

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:42.559
we just have to put a leash on him

00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:45.478
so he can't mess with you again.

00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:47.606
Right?

00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:45.807
I let it slide
when you broke the study door.

00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:48.393
But this time, I need an explanation.

00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:51.479
Why did you do it?

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:53.898
You even hurt your hand.

00:29:05.493 --> 00:29:07.370
It doesn't look like you drank.

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.248
Is something bothering you?

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:18.256
Are you still scared that
Sim Sung-hee might come back?

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:21.009
It's not that.

00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:23.303
Then...

00:29:25.847 --> 00:29:27.766
are you dissatisfied

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:30.393
with our marriage?

00:29:35.648 --> 00:29:37.817
That would hurt my feelings.

00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.407
Because I really like you.

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:48.411
I want you...

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.999
to rely on me more.

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:59.130
I already am relying on you.

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:05.261
You don't want me
to become a helpless fool

00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:08.056
who can't do anything
without you, do you?

00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:16.981
If I become someone
indispensable in your life

00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:19.609
I'd be honored.

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:26.533
Anyway, will you be able
to shoot tomorrow?

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.035
I'm worried.

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.538
Maybe I should get you
some herbal medicine.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:37.877
Of course, I can. I'm not badly hurt.

00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:43.049
Good.

00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:48.513
But I'm still worried,
so I'll stop by the set tomorrow.

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:51.057
And I'll drive you home afterward.

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:52.809
Is that okay?

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:30.889
Long time no see.

00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:35.351
- You doing all right?
- How is Ah-jin?

00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:36.853
You're unbelievable.

00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:39.522
If you were so worried,
why are you showing up now?

00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:42.525
She's in danger.

00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:44.777
What do you mean, she's in danger?

00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:46.154
It's her husband.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.324
Do-hyuk, that bastard,
is completely insane.

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.909
He's shady in more ways than one.

00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:53.202
I think Ah-jin fell into his trap.

00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:56.706
Do you have proof
for what you just said?

00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:57.916
That's the problem.

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.752
I don't have any evidence
to prove that he's nuts.

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.881
Ah-jin called me not long ago,
saying something felt off about him.

00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:07.634
But she doesn't even remember
making that call.

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:10.303
That's why you and I
need to help her.

00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:11.888
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:14.766
I'm not sure.

00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:18.394
It feels like we'd be interfering
with her life.

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:20.730
What part of what I just said
did you not understand?

00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:21.856
Her husband--

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.025
You just said you had no proof.

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:27.028
Maybe you're the one
getting dragged around by her.

00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:28.655
What?

00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:29.781
You know how she is.

00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:31.824
She's not easily satisfied.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.455
She's living comfortably now,
and I don't want to disrupt that.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.210
We don't fucking know
how she's living right now!

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.294
Jae-oh.

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.048
You think she's doing well?

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:49.634
Sure. Her life is fucking perfect.

00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:53.930
Then why is she losing weight
and having nightmares every night?

00:32:54.514 --> 00:32:58.935
She's trembling in fear because
she can't remember what she said!

00:32:59.018 --> 00:33:01.104
- You need to calm down.
- Let go of me.

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:05.066
Fine. I'll handle this alone.

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:07.318
You can stay out of this, asshole.

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:10.196
Fucking jackass.

00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:21.582
If divorce isn't an option

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:25.044
we just have to put a leash on him

00:33:25.628 --> 00:33:27.296
so he can't mess with you again.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.051
Hi, Ah-jin.

00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:34.762
There's been a change in the script.
See you soon.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.109
Director.

00:33:50.278 --> 00:33:51.821
Why was the script changed?

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:54.907
We just had to change it
all of a sudden.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:35.990
Ah-jin.

00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:38.117
Have you been well?

00:34:41.537 --> 00:34:42.622
You've really grown.

00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:46.334
I missed you.

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:51.839
Ah-jin, are you okay?

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.050
Ah-jin?

00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:57.053
Is there a problem?

00:34:57.845 --> 00:34:58.846
No.

00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:14.153
Ready, action.

00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:48.312
Cut. Let's go again.

00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:57.738
Ready, action.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.718
Cut.

00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:22.805
I'm sorry. I'll do that again.

00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:29.353
Ready, action.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.474
I need a short break.

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.273
Come on.

00:37:15.524 --> 00:37:18.069
You weren't the one who killed him.

00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:23.032
You can do this.

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:24.951
Yes, you can.

00:37:38.297 --> 00:37:40.800
Let's go again. I'm ready now.

00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:42.718
Sure, okay.

00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:44.053
ACTRESS BAEK AH-JIN

00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:45.263
Get ready, guys.

00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:47.306
- We're ready.
- Ready.

00:37:48.307 --> 00:37:49.308
Action.

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:27.054
Ah-jin!

00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:28.389
Ah-jin.

00:38:43.779 --> 00:38:44.780
Cut!

00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:48.034
Cut.

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:51.912
Go and stop her!

00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.040
Ah-jin!

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.293
Check if he's okay.

00:38:57.376 --> 00:38:58.586
Su-hoon, are you okay?

00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:00.880
Wake up.

00:39:00.963 --> 00:39:01.964
Excuse me...

00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.049
Is he okay?

00:39:04.216 --> 00:39:06.427
Su-hoon, are you all right?

00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:47.051
ACTOR HWANG SU-HOON
CRITICALLY INJURED DURING FILMING

00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:49.387
THE CAMERAS STOPPED ROLLING,
BUT SHE DIDN'T

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.639
BAEK AH-JIN IS CRAZY
VS IS BEING IN CHARACTER A CRIME?

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:52.848
MIXED REACTIONS ONLINE

00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:56.685
Director, let me ask you one thing.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.773
That rooftop house scene
wasn't in the original script.

00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:03.067
Why was it suddenly changed?

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:07.488
The investor suddenly threatened
to pull their funding

00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:09.448
and started making strange demands.

00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:10.533
The investor?

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:11.909
Saturn.

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:14.161
The company your husband runs.

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.415
Ma'am?

00:40:18.707 --> 00:40:19.917
Ma'am.

00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:22.628
Mr. Moon just stepped out.

00:40:23.003 --> 00:40:24.088
Where did he go?

00:40:24.171 --> 00:40:26.382
He went to work out.

00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:50.614
You got here earlier than I expected.

00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:57.580
Why did you have the script changed?

00:40:57.663 --> 00:40:58.664
Right.

00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.000
I already told you.

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:04.753
I want you to rely on me completely

00:41:04.837 --> 00:41:07.047
but you clearly have
no intention of doing that.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.553
Turns out

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.972
I have to push you this hard

00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:18.476
for you to come running to me.

00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:20.603
Figures.

00:41:21.395 --> 00:41:24.607
I guess leaking those cheap
tabloid articles wasn't enough.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.068
So those articles were your doing.

00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:30.571
Why are you doing this to me?

00:41:34.074 --> 00:41:37.536
I gave you everything you wanted,
didn't I?

00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:42.791
The least you can do
is make me happy in return.

00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:46.086
I've always done my best for you.

00:41:47.379 --> 00:41:48.589
This is really hurtful.

00:41:54.803 --> 00:41:56.931
Take those articles down now.

00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.558
If I take them down

00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:04.438
does that mean you'll behave
the way I want you to?

00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:07.399
Why should I live my life
the way you want?

00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:10.694
Because I like you.

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:20.246
Unfortunately,
my ex-wife broke too easily

00:42:21.413 --> 00:42:23.040
for all the effort I put into her.

00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:26.669
But I feel like
you will stay by my side

00:42:27.127 --> 00:42:29.255
with that pretty face of yours.

00:42:30.464 --> 00:42:34.760
You'll keep me entertained,
just like you always have.

00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:37.888
That's why I took you in
when you were so pitiful.

00:42:41.183 --> 00:42:42.476
Fuck you.

00:42:49.692 --> 00:42:50.901
You son of a bitch.

00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:57.700
If you feel wronged...

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:01.996
Right. Think of it as punishment.

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:03.539
"Punishment"?

00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:05.207
You said it yourself.

00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:08.586
I thought I was being punished.

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:11.630
Why do you think
you're being punished?

00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:17.678
When my mom begged me to save her

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:20.055
I just stood there and watched.

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:23.142
I thought all of this
was punishment for that.

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.441
You don't remember?

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.152
Is this a dream?

00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:35.613
You didn't come to me before.

00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:38.782
You acted as if
you'd never see me again.

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.744
Of course, this is a dream.

00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.204
When you wake up

00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:46.957
you won't remember any of this.

00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:51.045
So?

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:54.923
Is it starting to come back to you?

00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:01.263
Ah-jin,
I have plenty of ways to corner you.

00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:03.974
Your past could be exposed
at any time.

00:44:04.058 --> 00:44:06.727
And when that happens,
that fall is going to hurt.

00:44:11.607 --> 00:44:13.776
That's the end of my patience.

00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:17.488
If you don't want to lose
everything I've given you...

00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:20.532
If you want to stay
right where you are

00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:26.121
then I'm sure you know
exactly what you have to do.

00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:34.797
Ah-jin.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:37.675
You're a smart girl.

00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:22.219
Shit.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.935
This is Moon Do-hyuk.

00:45:30.018 --> 00:45:31.478
You know who I am, right?

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:34.606
What is this about?
How did you get my number--

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.025
My wife isn't doing so well right now

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:39.653
so I'd like you
to look after her for me.

00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:43.949
I'm a little tired after my workout

00:45:44.658 --> 00:45:46.577
so I'm thinking of sleeping
at a hotel tonight.

00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:48.495
Where is Ah-jin right now?

00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:51.081
Just come to the address
I'm sending you.

00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:10.559
Ah-jin.

00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:13.020
You...

00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:29.077
Let's get you out of here.
You'll catch a cold.

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:38.378
Jun-seo.

00:46:42.257 --> 00:46:44.343
Do you know what I realized today?

00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:50.349
I realized...

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.937
I could still be thrown away.

00:47:02.277 --> 00:47:03.445
After all I've done...

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.783
After all I've done to climb up here

00:47:09.368 --> 00:47:13.497
how can I still be someone
who gets thrown away?

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.333
How is that even possible?

00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:21.046
Ah-jin, you need to calm down.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.050
This is so humiliating!

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.189
I'm going to take it.

00:47:39.898 --> 00:47:41.817
I'm going to take Do-hyuk's position.

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:46.363
I'm going to get rid of him
and take his place.

00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:49.199
I can do it.

00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:50.325
Right?

00:47:51.243 --> 00:47:54.830
Jun-seo, help me. Please?

00:47:54.913 --> 00:47:57.875
This is the man who had his ex-wife
locked up in a mental hospital.

00:47:57.958 --> 00:48:00.669
He tracked down my number
and called me to come get you.

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:03.422
You know exactly how dangerous he is.

00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:04.840
So what?

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:08.594
- What about it?
- You're the one who will break!

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:11.471
You're going to break before he does.

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.807
Why don't you see
how dangerous he really is?

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:15.100
It's not fair.

00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:19.938
Why is he allowed to do
whatever he wants, and I'm not?

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:23.066
Why am I always the one
who has to suffer?

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:28.196
Why am I the only one
who has to fear hitting rock bottom?

00:48:28.822 --> 00:48:31.742
Why?

00:48:33.118 --> 00:48:36.038
Why?

00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:40.959
I can do it.

00:48:43.795 --> 00:48:44.880
I've got this.

00:48:45.547 --> 00:48:46.548
Right?

00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:50.385
I will...

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.055
I'll get rid of that jerk.

00:49:30.342 --> 00:49:32.427
Why did I...

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:54.992
Ah-jin, what's going on?
Are you okay?

00:49:55.409 --> 00:49:56.535
Where are you?

00:49:56.618 --> 00:49:57.953
Jae-oh.

00:49:59.913 --> 00:50:01.748
I can't hold on anymore.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.211
Ah-jin.

00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:09.047
Don't worry.
I'm going to fix everything.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:11.717
I'm ready.

00:50:19.975 --> 00:50:21.059
Jae-oh.

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:26.314
Why do you do all this for me?

00:50:31.903 --> 00:50:34.156
You don't expect anything from me.

00:50:38.493 --> 00:50:41.705
And you do whatever I ask you to.

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.003
It feels strange.

00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:52.591
I don't understand it.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.640
I just like being by your side.

00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:05.020
Maybe it's because
I don't have much in my life

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:08.106
but you're everything to me.

00:51:12.944 --> 00:51:15.238
Every time I help you
get what you want...

00:51:16.615 --> 00:51:19.159
Every time I make things
easier for you...

00:51:21.453 --> 00:51:23.830
you have no idea how useful I feel.

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.253
So go ahead, Ah-jin.

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:33.131
Use me all you want.

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:35.801
That's what I want.

00:52:02.911 --> 00:52:06.164
You've finished your IV drip.
Let me take it out for you.

00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:10.877
All done, ma'am.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.237
You seem to be doing better today.
That's a relief.

00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:39.447
Do I?

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:42.701
Why is that a relief, though?

00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:46.371
After what happened
during the last shoot...

00:52:46.454 --> 00:52:47.455
What happened?

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.916
I don't really remember.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.211
It's best not to dwell
on the unpleasant things.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.882
Forget what happened,
and good luck on your last shoot.

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.598
Hi, Do-hyuk.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.322
Is today your last shoot?

00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:21.740
Yes.

00:53:22.324 --> 00:53:25.702
I'm going on a business trip tonight,
so I won't have time later.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.954
But I wanted to congratulate you.

00:53:29.998 --> 00:53:30.999
Thanks.

00:53:40.425 --> 00:53:41.635
Do you feel all right now?

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:43.511
What do you mean?

00:53:44.137 --> 00:53:45.931
You were mad at me last night.

00:53:46.973 --> 00:53:48.350
I kept thinking about it.

00:53:48.433 --> 00:53:50.810
When we were at the swimming pool,
you called me

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.271
a son of a bitch.

00:53:55.106 --> 00:53:56.274
It was pretty intense.

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:00.820
What's wrong?

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.697
You must have dreamed that.

00:54:03.531 --> 00:54:05.784
When did I go
to the swimming pool with you?

00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:11.873
You don't remember?

00:54:17.212 --> 00:54:20.548
Do-hyuk, are you teasing me?

00:54:21.716 --> 00:54:24.344
I would never say something
that awful to you.

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:27.764
You were the one who held my hand
when I was struggling the most.

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:12.309
Get out.

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.227
Get out of the car, asshole!

00:55:19.607 --> 00:55:21.609
You didn't get hurt
as badly as I'd hoped.

00:55:22.277 --> 00:55:23.278
What a shame.

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.322
What the hell? Who are you?

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.617
You know me, right? Kim Jae-oh.

00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:32.662
I'm the guy you tried to burn alive
when you set my office on fire.

00:55:35.707 --> 00:55:37.459
I almost died that day.

00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:40.754
So I'm here to return the favor.

00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:48.470
I don't know
what you're talking about

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.639
but if you value your life,
you'd better drop that idea.

00:55:52.057 --> 00:55:53.099
No, thanks.

00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:55.352
I know everything now.

00:55:56.936 --> 00:55:59.439
You're the one with the cross tattoo.

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:00.940
Who was the other one?

00:56:02.275 --> 00:56:03.276
Moon Do-hyuk.

00:56:03.943 --> 00:56:05.528
The obnoxious psycho.

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.325
I'll make both your lives
a living hell

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:12.243
until the day I die.

00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:14.954
How does that sound?

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:16.873
Fun, right?

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:27.759
See you around.

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:53.410
Yes, go ahead.

00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:55.078
Sir, we have a problem.

00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:56.496
What problem?

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.039
Kim Jae-oh came to see me.

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:01.876
He said he knew everything
about the fire and threatened me.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.629
He even warned me
that he would repay the favor.

00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:06.548
So?

00:57:06.631 --> 00:57:09.217
It looks like
he'll come after you too.

00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:12.846
Should we eliminate him for good?

00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:17.642
Some people don't know their place,
even when we treat them gently.

00:57:18.059 --> 00:57:20.645
They never appreciate
how lenient we are.

00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:23.857
Take care of Kim Jae-oh
however you want.

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.944
Just make sure
I never hear about him again.

00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:29.529
I don't want his name

00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:33.950
ruining another meal with my wife.

00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:36.995
Get to it, then.

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:56.055
Wait, hold on.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.726
- Come on.
- Seriously.

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.394
Why do you look so ugly today?

00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:02.812
Which lane? I'm going jungle.

00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:04.564
- I'm going jungle.
- Me too.

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:06.024
The worst player buys ramyeon.

00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:09.486
- All right.
- Sounds good.

00:58:09.569 --> 00:58:10.820
I'm right below Seung-jae.

00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:13.114
- I'm safe.
- Isn't Yun-ho the worst, though?

00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:15.617
- What are you talking about?
- He's the worst.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:16.784
That's right, kid.

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.329
Just keep living like you are now.

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:23.291
Eat well, hang out with your friends

00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:27.462
get your diploma
and get into a good college.

00:58:28.713 --> 00:58:30.924
- He's the worst jungler.
- Come on.

00:58:35.094 --> 00:58:36.888
You don't need me anymore.

00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:39.432
No, he's better.

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:54.864
Hey.

00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:56.950
We're all set over here.

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.535
Okay, thank you.

00:58:58.826 --> 00:58:59.953
By the way

00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:02.705
you set everything up
exactly the way I asked, right?

00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:04.499
I told you not to worry.

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:07.627
Why are you always so suspicious?

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:08.836
Don't you trust me?

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:11.422
It's not that.

00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:13.508
It's just that
this is really important.

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.385
Anyway...

00:59:16.636 --> 00:59:17.720
Thank you.

00:59:55.216 --> 00:59:56.217
Damn it.

00:59:56.968 --> 00:59:57.969
Get him!

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.597
- Get him!
- Get him!

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.681
Stop him!

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.017
- Get him!
- Catch him!

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.019
Ready, action.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.693
Open the door.

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:16.696
Why is it always so loud in there?

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.950
I'm settling this today

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.244
so stop acting like you're not home
and open up.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.331
I knew it.

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:29.667
I knew you were home.

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:31.753
Why aren't you answering...

01:00:33.087 --> 01:00:34.088
Oh, my gosh!

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:03.177
Please stop. I beg you.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.326
- Grab him.
- Come here, you bastard!

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.396
I'll help you get to heaven.

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:15.726
DEAR X

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.202
