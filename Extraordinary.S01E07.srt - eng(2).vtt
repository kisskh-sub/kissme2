00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.240
Father, hurry, kill her!

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.520
It's you.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.919
You're dressed as a man.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.280
And your martial arts are so strong.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.439
How many secrets do you have?

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.240
Not going to tell me, huh?

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.680
I'll say it for you.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.360
The flowers in the Imperial Garden have bloomed.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.280
They're especially beautiful.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.479
I was sent by Your Majesty to protect you.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.719
He'd be that kind?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.879
Young Duke.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.120
I did save your life today, after all.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.159
You have time to doubt me here,

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.960
better spend it thinking carefully

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.599
about who really wants to assassinate you.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.000
Celestial Star Tower.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.319
Ping'an.

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:25.400
Let her go.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.599
Throw her out.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.000
Go on, go on, go on.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.039
Without me,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.639
Your Majesty would send someone else anyway.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.120
Young Duke, do you want to be always on guard

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.800
or are you willing to trust me one more time?

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.240
I mean no harm to the Duke's household.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.719
Young Duke.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.479
Why don't we trust her one more time?

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.719
We're all so familiar now.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.000
Then I'll trust you one last time.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.800
Young Duke, it's very late.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.960
The lady is already resting.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.280
We paid for Cangxiang Pavilion,

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.560
yet can't even see anyone?

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:14.759
Young Duke.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.199
Miss.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:17.680
Why are you here?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.399
Young Duke.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.079
Why did you come so late?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800
Young Duke, I was just nearly

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.800
scared out of my wits.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.600
I couldn't sleep at all after going back.

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.519
So I thought

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.680
I'd come here to hear Ziyan play a tune.

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.360
To calm my nerves.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.319
Young Duke.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.439
The lady isn't feeling well today.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.480
What, won't you honor me?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.879
Or is it

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.639
that you can't play?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.920
Young Duke, you're joking.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.720
Playing for the Young Duke

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:08.920
is my honor.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.800
Young Duke, please have a seat.

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.199
I'll play for you right away.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.959
Miss, isn't the zither already broken?

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:18.240
Don't talk so much.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.360
If the Young Duke wants music,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.800
even a broken zither must be played.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.160
Forget it.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.560
I brought this awkwardness on myself.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.160
Made Xiaocui Girl get slapped.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.399
And ruined my mood.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.079
Ping'an.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.480
We're done.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.519
Yes.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.639
Miss.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560
Is your injury alright?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.120
It's fine.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.319
I've taken care of it.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.759
The wounds from today

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.480
I'll get payback for them, with interest.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.079
Young Duke.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.319
Ziyan is so ruthless.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.680
Xiaocui Girl is so pitiful.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.360
How do you know

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.720
they're not just acting?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720
Latest news.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.639
The Qiang envoy fled overnight.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:21.800
Really?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.800
Congratulations, Duke.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.879
I heard Linggou Shi did a great deed.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.560
Maybe he'll get promoted and titled.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:32.480
Promotion

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.199
requires the right fate, too.

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.879
Darn it, so many people!

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.399
Just a Linggou official.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.560
Who gave you the guts to come here?

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.199
Guards, drag him out!

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.680
YOUR MAJESTY ARRIVES

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.639
They're here.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.839
You, such nerve.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:58.360
Your Majesty.

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:59.639
Your Majesty.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.439
Shi Feifan, how did the Qiang envoy matter go?

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.800
Your Majesty, I did not fail you.

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:15.680
Good.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.879
Reward.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.600
Thank you.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.199
Your Majesty.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.439
I believe Linggou Shi should be punished.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.360
Linggou Shi called the Qiang man his brother.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.319
Accepted bribes.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.399
Utterly disgraced Da Nan Chao.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.680
Your Highness.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:36.439
That wasn't a bribe.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.040
It was Your Majesty's reward to me.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:41.759
Your Majesty.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:45.480
I believe Linggou Shi is upright.

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.439
He would never collude with outsiders.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.519
But my words carry little weight.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.560
It's hard to silence the rumors.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.279
Prime Minister Lü makes sense.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.360
Dismiss Shi Feifan from Linggou Shi post.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.279
Young Duke.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.959
Why are you so angry?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.799
Never mind.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.679
Now that you've lost your post,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.559
it might not be a bad thing.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.559
True.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.240
At least you got Fan Lou for free.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.039
Duke, Duke!

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.519
Deputy General Zhang sent a letter.

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:53.120
What's wrong, Father?

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:54.480
Your Uncle Zhang says

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:56.000
the army rations have been short for months.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.519
The soldiers aren't getting enough to eat.

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:59.679
There have already been several deserters.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.039
What about those paper shares from last time?

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.960
Your Majesty already borrowed them.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.200
In one hand, out the other.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.519
He figured out how to play the game.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:18.000
Forget it.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.799
Father.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.840
Right now, raising army pay is most urgent.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:27.120
Maybe Fan Lou is a good card for profit.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.679
No.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.240
Too slow.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.679
So late at night,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.000
why are we at this creepy place?

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.639
Ghosts—do you even know what they look like?

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:47.679
They look like this.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.720
Young Duke.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.320
And we’re carrying a shovel.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.879
Are we here to dig up a grave?

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.080
So what if we are? Are you scared?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.120
You—uh...

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.000
Why aren’t you this smug in daylight?

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.200
Young Duke covers food, lodging, and pays silver.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.559
This much per month.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.519
Why wouldn’t I come?

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:09.360
Exactly.

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:13.559
Besides, Young Duke is so wise and heroic.

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:16.600
Unmatched in the world, truly outstanding.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.919
Sycophant.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.840
Young Duke.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.159
White smoke is rising from this mountain for no reason.

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:26.759
It’s honestly a bit creepy.

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.799
You can’t judge things by appearances.

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:36.879
If I’m not mistaken,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.559
this should be an open-pit coal mine.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.080
Young Duke, how do you know that?

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.080
This is yours too.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.399
Can I trade this for more?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.759
It’s right here.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.559
Start digging.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.720
Dig.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.159
Okay.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.559
It’s fine, I’ve got it.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:38.759
It’s fine.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.960
Young Duke.

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:41.360
I’m hurt.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.720
Ping'an! Ping'an! Ping'an!

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:47.480
Ping'an! Ping'an!

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.879
Ping'an! Ping'an! Ping'an!

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.399
Are you okay, Ping'an? Ping'an!

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:51.360
Ping'an!

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:52.279
Say something, Ping'an!

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:53.679
Ping'an!

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.120
Ping'an! Ping'an! Are you alright?

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:56.480
Ping'an! Ping'an!

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:57.639
Where are you? Say something!

00:11:59.159 --> 00:11:59.679
Ping'an!

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.519
Young Duke, I’m fine.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.519
I’m fine.

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:03.559
There’s coal.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.960
Is the Gatling Plus finished?

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:16.480
Not yet.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.279
But I’ve brought Your Majesty something good.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480
How dare you, Shi Feifan!

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:43.840
You dare fool His Majesty with charcoal?

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.000
This isn’t charcoal.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.679
This is called coal—smokeless coal.

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.720
Another rare thing you invented?

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:56.440
Not at all.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.000
Coal is a naturally formed fuel.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.799
It can be used by ordinary people

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.159
for cooking and heating.

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:04.799
It’s also useful for iron smelting and copper melting.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.480
Stone processing and cinnabar refining.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.080
The coal mine I discovered

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.759
can supply the capital’s people for ten years.

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:13.240
Excellent.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.919
Where is this mined?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.039
I’ll send people there at once.

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:19.480
I humbly request,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.240
Your Majesty, to trade coal for grain.

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:29.440
Bold and clever.

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:31.200
It may be useful in the future.
