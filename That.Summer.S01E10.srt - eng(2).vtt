00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:24.391
Even if I only have one day, one hour, or one minute left,

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.136
I'll make you remember what happened between us.

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:30.505
Can you and Dr. Wut adopt my daughter as your own?

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:33.395
If another child joins the family, I'm ready.

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.337
Let's go file the papers at the district office.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.309
From what you've shown me,

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.430
Lava and Wave must have shared so many good memories together, right?

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:44.074
Did you remember everything?

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.239
Can I try something?

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:49.703
It's a lot clearer now.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.955
You should get some rest, Prince.

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:04.040
Tomorrow I'll take you
to see the sunrise at dawn.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.177
At dawn?

00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:07.816
Will that be okay?

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:08.875
Oh, come on.

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:13.600
When you dragged me out at 5 a.m.,
I literally fell asleep under the sun.

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:15.886
That does sound familiar.

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:20.227
Fine. Then I'll go to bed early tonight.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.878
Then I won't bother you tonight.

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:34.875
Lava!

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:36.720
I couldn't reach you at all.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.394
Uncle, what?

00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:39.544
There was barely any signal on the island.

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:42.519
Someone came to see you, Prince.

00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:44.610
Who?

00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:50.870
Anya!

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.686
Davin!

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.378
Davin,

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.745
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.057
Same here.

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:17.879
How did you get here?

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.581
Where are Father and Mother?

00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:23.686
I wanted to come get you myself.

00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:25.990
Father and Mother are fine.

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.825
Things in Arantha have calmed down.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.830
Paolo and our soldiers already handled General and his men.

00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:39.940
We have the people here
to thank for capturing Victor.

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:42.422
It gave us leverage.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.532
Paolo told me everyone here
took great care of you.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.496
I want to repay them.

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:56.692
Everything on the table is a local specialty.

00:03:56.692 --> 00:03:58.715
I asked the best cook on the island to prepare it.

00:03:59.624 --> 00:04:00.446
Thank you.

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:03.501
You looked after Davin,
and now you're taking care of me too.

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:10.743
Would you like a lot of rice?

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:13.435
Half is enough for me. I don't eat a lot.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.942
Thank you.

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:26.930
This is too much for me.

00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:28.170
I can't finish all this.

00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:31.411
You usually eat a lot here,

00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:33.412
especially when the food is spicy.

00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:37.925
I thought you didn't like spicy food.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.237
I can handle it.

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:46.759
Well, here, the spicier it is, the more he eats.

00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:53.283
Um… enjoy your meal.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.236
Hey, wait.

00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:57.791
Where are you two going?

00:04:57.791 --> 00:04:58.494
Sit and eat with us.

00:04:58.494 --> 00:04:59.360
There's so much food.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.786
Davin and I can't finish it.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.608
We'll eat at another table.

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:05.198
No, stay.

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:06.767
I have so many things

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:07.886
I want to ask about Davin,

00:05:08.303 --> 00:05:09.625
like how spicy he likes it.

00:05:11.942 --> 00:05:13.688
Oh, it's not that.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.279
I mean how fun things were.

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:19.158
Please excuse me.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.915
Lava! Where are you going?

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:40.616
I'm sorry he's being rude.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.438
Please start eating first.

00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:48.831
Give me your arms, Your Highness.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.868
And your legs.

00:06:06.804 --> 00:06:07.772
There are a lot of mosquitoes.

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:09.441
You might get sick.

00:06:10.546 --> 00:06:11.249
Thank you.

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:15.328
Princess, would you like some too?

00:06:15.893 --> 00:06:17.518
Oh, no, it's alright.

00:06:22.823 --> 00:06:23.956
Enjoy your meal.

00:06:34.063 --> 00:06:34.728
Thank you.

00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:47.705
Everyone here really took good care of you,

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:49.256
especially Lava.

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.183
He served your food

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:53.735
and wouldn't let mosquitoes bite you.

00:06:55.405 --> 00:06:58.817
We should hire him as
a royal guard in Arantha.

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:03.896
You teased me because
you've figured it out, haven't you?

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:08.637
Do you realize you've never been able
to hide your feelings?

00:07:10.258 --> 00:07:11.587
So how does that matter now?

00:07:12.238 --> 00:07:14.007
We're leaving tomorrow anyway.

00:07:15.628 --> 00:07:19.151
Just when everything started coming back,
I'm out of time.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.433
Then what do you want to do?

00:07:21.268 --> 00:07:22.395
Stay longer?

00:07:22.862 --> 00:07:23.789
I can leave first.

00:07:24.722 --> 00:07:27.666
I can't. Father and Mother are worried.

00:07:35.683 --> 00:07:40.061
You never know how many times in your life you'll find someone who loves you.

00:07:41.338 --> 00:07:43.160
If you get the chance, hold on to it.

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:45.961
I can't hold on to it.

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.851
We live so far apart.

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:52.757
If he can't come up to you,

00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:55.904
then you come down to him.

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:01.958
Make the most of the time you have left.

00:08:02.818 --> 00:08:04.376
Every second matters.

00:08:05.457 --> 00:08:08.105
One day it'll all become a precious memory.

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:13.694
Now go to bed.

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.007
You can't sleep?

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.620
It's hot.

00:08:58.216 --> 00:08:59.829
What about you?
Why aren't you asleep?

00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:01.729
You have to wake up early for the boat.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:05.473
I know. Stop reminding me.

00:09:11.171 --> 00:09:15.095
Are you upset that I suddenly have to leave?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.702
How could I be upset?

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:20.944
It's good that you're going home.

00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:23.719
You've been away for months,

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.010
living on an island,

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.684
scrubbing boats.

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:32.890
You should be in a palace,

00:09:33.578 --> 00:09:35.990
drinking tea, playing polo,

00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:38.177
and doing charity work.

00:09:39.307 --> 00:09:41.825
Hey, don't be sarcastic.

00:09:42.341 --> 00:09:44.871
I'm not. I mean it.

00:09:46.517 --> 00:09:48.115
No matter how hard I try,

00:09:48.803 --> 00:09:50.030
it doesn't change anything.

00:10:19.073 --> 00:10:20.753
What if I want to be the one trying?

00:10:23.798 --> 00:10:28.209
If this is our last night together,

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:33.354
can we make it a night
we'll remember forever?

00:10:39.543 --> 00:10:41.404
The princess might see us.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.510
You don't have to worry.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:47.872
My sister knows.

00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:51.309
She's seen how obvious you are.

00:10:54.115 --> 00:10:55.235
I'm sorry.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.401
I'm not very good at hiding my feelings.

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:01.827
I'm the same.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:08.671
If you feel something, then do it.

00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:12.218
Who knows when you'll get another chance?

00:11:16.393 --> 00:11:17.809
I came down here for you.

00:11:19.749 --> 00:11:21.297
Won't you take the chance?

00:11:57.547 --> 00:12:00.114
Can I hug you as long as possible?

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.367
Thank you again
for taking care of my brother.

00:12:57.128 --> 00:12:59.623
It's our pleasure, Princess.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.200
I may not remember much,

00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:06.965
but I can feel that during my time here,

00:13:07.284 --> 00:13:10.794
I truly received help and love from all of you.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.754
And congratulations on the new family.

00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:15.154
Thank you.

00:13:15.915 --> 00:13:17.845
You're always welcome back here.

00:13:25.213 --> 00:13:28.308
Lava, aren't you going to see the prince off?

00:13:28.947 --> 00:13:29.839
No.

00:13:30.723 --> 00:13:32.515
They'll be fine without me.

00:13:36.346 --> 00:13:39.453
They will, but the prince will be sad

00:13:39.969 --> 00:13:42.861
if the most important person to him
isn't there.

00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:55.985
I don't want the last thing
I see to be him leaving.

00:13:58.416 --> 00:14:01.460
It feels like I'll never see him again.

00:14:02.786 --> 00:14:06.389
All the more reason to end things well.

00:14:07.642 --> 00:14:13.043
Let the last image he takes from this island
be you sending him off with a smile,

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:14.237
not tears.

00:14:18.216 --> 00:14:19.127
Think about it.

00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:31.724
I still need time to rebuild our friendship.

00:14:31.724 --> 00:14:33.299
If you miss us,

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:34.972
you can check social media.

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:37.651
Follow me, and I'll follow you back.

00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:40.317
Of course.

00:14:43.068 --> 00:14:46.638
So you two are officially dating now?

00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:50.684
Go on. Say it.

00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:52.059
Tell him.

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.154
I just said yes,

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:56.475
but we're only trying it out for now.

00:14:56.475 --> 00:15:00.656
I need to see if he becomes
more responsible first,

00:15:00.656 --> 00:15:01.734
and I'll decide what to do then.

00:15:02.594 --> 00:15:04.615
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:15:04.615 --> 00:15:07.603
When I get married,
you have to be the guest of honor.

00:15:07.603 --> 00:15:10.460
We'll have a honeymoon trip in Arantha.

00:15:10.656 --> 00:15:11.922
Please lend me your palace.

00:15:12.757 --> 00:15:13.921
That's too much, Tum.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:15.553
Of course.

00:15:16.339 --> 00:15:17.470
He just gave us permission.

00:15:18.428 --> 00:15:19.503
Honeymoon in the palace!

00:15:23.236 --> 00:15:24.733
Study hard, Aomsin.

00:15:25.077 --> 00:15:26.174
Practice a lot.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.568
Even if you're already good,

00:15:28.568 --> 00:15:30.023
you still need to practice.

00:15:30.023 --> 00:15:30.528
Yes.

00:15:31.044 --> 00:15:32.347
Don't compete with anyone.

00:15:32.642 --> 00:15:33.592
Just compete with yourself.

00:15:33.911 --> 00:15:35.417
Yes, Teacher Wave.

00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:37.150
Uh, Your Highness.

00:15:37.543 --> 00:15:41.163
I'll practice hard
and become a world-class musician!

00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:46.259
Will I get my head chopped off?

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:00.081
Lava asked me to say goodbye for him.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.173
He just has some family matters
to take care of.

00:16:26.176 --> 00:16:27.737
Bye!

00:16:59.798 --> 00:17:01.736
Prince! Wait for me!

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.451
Prince!

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.233
Prince! Wait for me!

00:17:09.872 --> 00:17:10.906
Prince!

00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:21.321
Prince! Wait for me!

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:47.469
Whatever happened here, leave it here.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.459
These last three months meant a lot to me.

00:17:55.982 --> 00:17:57.722
I know, but you and he
live in different worlds now.

00:17:58.336 --> 00:18:01.921
No one can take away what you two had.

00:18:03.075 --> 00:18:05.029
It'll always stay with you.

00:18:09.278 --> 00:18:11.423
But you have to get your own life back.

00:19:31.692 --> 00:19:33.156
How long have you been back?

00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:35.332
Why didn't you let me pick you up?

00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:41.863
I was afraid you were busy.

00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:43.086
I didn't want to trouble you.

00:19:43.602 --> 00:19:46.082
Trouble? I'm your mother.

00:19:46.748 --> 00:19:49.053
Don't you think I miss you too?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.574
You're becoming more like Peng.

00:19:58.519 --> 00:20:01.895
You're always wanting to do things yourself
and prove yourself.

00:20:03.893 --> 00:20:05.767
But sometimes I wish you'd tell me things.

00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:08.628
Ask for help.

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:14.213
I want you to know I worry about you.

00:20:16.855 --> 00:20:18.409
Talk to me once in a while.

00:20:18.946 --> 00:20:21.402
Okay, okay. I know.

00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:26.856
Peng told me about your dad's motorcycle.

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:28.948
I'll get the money and buy it back myself.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.909
No. I'll work and earn money.

00:20:32.102 --> 00:20:35.151
See? Before I even finish talking!

00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:39.283
Fine. I'll help you find a job.

00:20:39.713 --> 00:20:42.126
Your dad's friend just opened
an architecture firm.

00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:46.103
No. I'll find one myself.

00:20:46.103 --> 00:20:49.785
No. Let me help you this time.

00:20:52.707 --> 00:20:53.857
Alright, alright.

00:20:59.271 --> 00:20:59.903
Mom.

00:21:00.569 --> 00:21:01.207
What?

00:21:03.828 --> 00:21:07.693
Do you still miss Dad?

00:21:10.808 --> 00:21:11.790
Of course.

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:14.200
Every day.

00:21:15.768 --> 00:21:18.684
Some days I miss him so much I cry.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.668
So what do you do?

00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:33.029
Nothing. I just keep living.

00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:36.100
It becomes a part of life.

00:21:38.785 --> 00:21:40.299
There were so many good memories.

00:21:40.944 --> 00:21:42.406
I don't need to forget them.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.730
It's better to keep them and cherish them.

00:22:38.845 --> 00:22:41.398
Davin, what song are you playing?

00:22:41.505 --> 00:22:42.468
I've never heard it before.

00:22:44.767 --> 00:22:46.944
I heard it in Thailand, Father.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.610
While we were locked up in the palace,

00:22:54.115 --> 00:22:55.963
Davin got to go to the beach,

00:22:56.178 --> 00:22:58.297
swim, and play the piano.

00:22:58.942 --> 00:23:00.773
Our summers were really different, weren't they?

00:23:02.083 --> 00:23:03.567
Please don't say that, Father.

00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:05.896
If nothing had happened to me,

00:23:06.304 --> 00:23:08.134
I would've hurried back
to Arantha right away.

00:23:10.712 --> 00:23:14.075
Davin, do you remember
meeting Kate when you were little?

00:23:14.075 --> 00:23:16.198
When the ambassador was stationed here?

00:23:16.714 --> 00:23:19.340
You two were so close.

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:21.293
You ran around the palace together all day.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.354
I remember a little, Mother.

00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:28.280
But it was so long ago.

00:23:29.719 --> 00:23:32.279
You even taught me how to play guitar,

00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:35.095
but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it.

00:23:35.589 --> 00:23:37.435
I couldn't even read music notes.

00:23:39.132 --> 00:23:41.385
Music really isn't my thing,

00:23:42.008 --> 00:23:44.809
unlike you, who are number one at it.

00:23:47.129 --> 00:23:48.715
That's the only thing I'm good at.

00:23:49.445 --> 00:23:52.389
I can't do other things,

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.151
like doing laundry,

00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:03.638
scraping boats,

00:24:04.755 --> 00:24:08.246
riding motorbikes, or cooking.

00:24:12.715 --> 00:24:14.946
Why would we ever need
to do those things, Davin?

00:24:14.946 --> 00:24:17.050
We have people who do that for us.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.521
But scraping boats?

00:24:20.273 --> 00:24:22.084
Why would we ever need to scrape boats?

00:24:25.328 --> 00:24:27.544
Maybe you just miss the beach.

00:24:31.647 --> 00:24:35.502
If you go again, take Kate with you.

00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:39.451
She knows a lot about Thailand.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.816
Her father was stationed there for years.

00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:47.169
I think you two will have a lot to talk about.

00:26:02.626 --> 00:26:03.688
That must be a scam caller.

00:26:13.034 --> 00:26:13.959
Ugh!

00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:22.520
You scam caller! Go to hell!

00:26:23.379 --> 00:26:25.292
(Lava, it's me.)

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:27.787
Me? Who? I'm not your friend to mess with.

00:26:28.646 --> 00:26:29.609
It's Davin.

00:26:38.969 --> 00:26:39.967
Prince Davin?

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.299
Yeah.

00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:45.450
So? Will you still tell me to go to hell?

00:26:46.309 --> 00:26:48.620
No. I'm sorry.

00:26:48.813 --> 00:26:50.621
I thought it was a scam call.

00:26:52.576 --> 00:26:55.942
Um… why did you call me?

00:26:56.758 --> 00:26:59.713
I watched Tum's video.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.954
And I saw the part where you were helping pull the shoe off my leg.

00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:05.986
It was so funny.

00:27:06.502 --> 00:27:08.835
I don't remember anything.

00:27:09.437 --> 00:27:12.008
Oh, we were having a water fight that day.

00:27:12.352 --> 00:27:14.318
Your foot got stuck in the shoe.

00:27:14.855 --> 00:27:17.001
I pulled and pulled and couldn't get it off.

00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:20.727
In the end I had to use soap.

00:27:21.028 --> 00:27:23.313
It was hilarious. I still remember it.

00:27:24.473 --> 00:27:26.472
When I watched Tum's videos again,

00:27:27.095 --> 00:27:31.654
everything I saw was just fun stuff
we did together.

00:27:33.996 --> 00:27:35.179
You miss those moments, right?

00:27:39.497 --> 00:27:43.079
If you do, you can call me anytime.

00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:47.408
I still have tons of fun stories to tell you.

00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:49.050
Will you even have time?

00:27:50.704 --> 00:27:55.247
For you, I'll always have time.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.159
Ouch!

00:28:11.534 --> 00:28:13.043
Don't hit snooze.

00:28:13.043 --> 00:28:15.043
Get up and go to work.

00:28:15.537 --> 00:28:17.053
Ugh… what?

00:28:17.053 --> 00:28:18.964
Give me ten more minutes and I'll leave.

00:28:19.523 --> 00:28:23.331
You're the one who said the later you leave,
the worse the traffic gets.

00:28:25.673 --> 00:28:27.048
What time is it?

00:28:27.564 --> 00:28:29.122
It's almost nine.

00:28:30.282 --> 00:28:33.076
If I were rich, I'd wake up in the afternoon.

00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:35.293
Ow!

00:28:35.293 --> 00:28:36.217
You know what they say?

00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:39.906
Early birds get the first worms.

00:28:40.937 --> 00:28:42.091
Have you ever heard this one?

00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:46.879
Late birds get fed by the early birds.

00:28:47.502 --> 00:28:49.336
Stop messing around. Go shower.

00:28:50.002 --> 00:28:51.497
Okay, okay.

00:28:51.497 --> 00:28:52.886
Then get up.

00:28:52.886 --> 00:28:53.902
- I know.
- Faster.

00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:57.510
Okay, okay. Fine, Your Highness!

00:29:00.356 --> 00:29:01.954
You want to turn FaceTime off first?

00:29:02.169 --> 00:29:04.461
Call me back after you shower.

00:29:04.998 --> 00:29:07.261
No need. What's there to be shy about?

00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:08.424
We've showered together before.

00:29:09.026 --> 00:29:10.029
I'm not shy.

00:29:10.759 --> 00:29:13.361
If you're brave enough to show it,
I'm brave enough to watch it.

00:29:13.361 --> 00:29:15.482
Oh, you said it yourself.

00:29:15.482 --> 00:29:16.816
Here. Look as much as you want.

00:29:16.816 --> 00:29:18.955
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Look as much as you want.

00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:21.435
What? Then I'll call you back later.

00:29:21.435 --> 00:29:23.673
What? You're not so bold after all, huh?

00:29:23.673 --> 00:29:24.588
Look at me.

00:29:24.588 --> 00:29:26.035
I'm showing off my muscles.

00:29:29.585 --> 00:29:31.334
So how are you these days?

00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:34.010
I'm good.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:35.671
I'm in my probation period,

00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:39.360
designing houses, condos,
coming up with new concepts.

00:29:40.176 --> 00:29:41.615
The company's pretty open-minded.

00:29:43.484 --> 00:29:44.698
That sounds fun.

00:29:45.987 --> 00:29:51.020
I'm still catching up on charity work
to make up for the time I was gone.

00:29:51.815 --> 00:29:54.512
Father wants people to like me more.

00:29:55.328 --> 00:29:58.746
I have to meet so many people.

00:29:59.605 --> 00:30:02.200
I'm tired of putting on a face.

00:30:02.866 --> 00:30:04.881
People already like you.

00:30:05.074 --> 00:30:07.049
You're both handsome and talented.

00:30:08.381 --> 00:30:10.736
What about you? Do you like me?

00:30:12.412 --> 00:30:14.249
It's more than ‘like' at this point.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.703
Hey, Lava! Who're you talking to?

00:30:19.832 --> 00:30:20.796
Your babe?

00:30:21.097 --> 00:30:21.972
Lava?

00:30:23.218 --> 00:30:24.703
No. I'm working.

00:30:24.982 --> 00:30:25.621
Working?

00:30:26.094 --> 00:30:28.599
Your eyes are sparkling at your screen.

00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:32.611
Dust, bro. My eyes are dry.

00:30:32.976 --> 00:30:33.777
Dust, huh?

00:30:35.303 --> 00:30:37.110
I'll tell Aui to buy an air filter.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.168
Okay.

00:30:49.962 --> 00:30:52.277
Move left a bit.

00:30:54.017 --> 00:30:54.736
Left.

00:30:54.843 --> 00:30:56.022
More to the left.

00:30:56.967 --> 00:30:59.078
Hey, your left, not mine!

00:30:59.078 --> 00:30:59.930
Your left.

00:31:00.115 --> 00:31:01.593
Then explain it to me in detail.

00:31:02.109 --> 00:31:03.384
Too far.

00:31:03.384 --> 00:31:04.579
Right a little.

00:31:04.708 --> 00:31:05.336
Right. Right.

00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:07.699
Davin, give the photo some life!

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:10.151
You're sitting still like a corpse.

00:31:10.344 --> 00:31:11.000
Hey.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.102
Just tell me what pose you want.

00:31:13.596 --> 00:31:15.889
Or just fly here and adjust me yourself.

00:31:19.863 --> 00:31:20.849
Don't challenge me.

00:31:21.429 --> 00:31:22.448
I'm not challenging you.

00:31:23.135 --> 00:31:24.496
Come for real.

00:31:30.385 --> 00:31:32.352
Hey, listen up.

00:31:32.718 --> 00:31:35.071
Stretch your legs so they look long.

00:31:35.071 --> 00:31:36.241
Why are you shrinking them?

00:31:37.002 --> 00:31:38.971
Bring your knee up.

00:31:39.551 --> 00:31:42.999
Create a triangle with your shoulders
to give a good posture.

00:31:45.018 --> 00:31:45.703
Lift your sleeve a bit.

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:47.474
Your hand disappears otherwise.

00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:53.451
This angle, okay?

00:31:59.197 --> 00:31:59.963
How is this?

00:32:01.016 --> 00:32:02.777
Much better.

00:32:02.949 --> 00:32:05.655
I look the same to me.

00:32:09.522 --> 00:32:14.556
Lately I've been dreaming
about the island a lot.

00:32:15.329 --> 00:32:16.221
What do you dream about?

00:32:17.553 --> 00:32:20.474
I dream we're driving together,

00:32:21.462 --> 00:32:24.606
drinking coffee, watching the sunrise.

00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:26.913
That wasn't a dream.

00:32:27.106 --> 00:32:30.115
That happened. It was insanely romantic.

00:32:33.352 --> 00:32:35.627
I wish I could close my eyes
and feel it more clearly.

00:32:40.332 --> 00:32:43.772
I'll never get to do something like that again.

00:32:44.803 --> 00:32:48.565
Wave is so lucky, unlike Davin,

00:32:51.852 --> 00:32:54.335
who's stuck alone in this palace forever.

00:32:56.419 --> 00:32:57.853
What if I come to the palace?

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:02.095
Are you serious?

00:33:02.868 --> 00:33:04.177
Don't give me hope like that.

00:33:05.788 --> 00:33:06.571
I'm serious.

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:08.940
I always mean what I say
and do what I say.

00:33:09.456 --> 00:33:12.949
Then your dream can finally come true.

00:33:38.953 --> 00:33:39.851
Thank you.

00:33:44.723 --> 00:33:45.916
Hello, Mr. Lava.

00:33:46.301 --> 00:33:48.030
Welcome to Arantha.

00:33:48.749 --> 00:33:49.631
How have you been?

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.680
Hi, Paolo. I'm good.

00:33:54.912 --> 00:33:55.696
Whoa.

00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:58.523
You look cool in full uniform.

00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:01.079
You're not scared of me anymore?

00:34:02.414 --> 00:34:03.379
A little.

00:34:03.713 --> 00:34:06.104
The image of you shooting that guy
is still in my head.

00:34:06.515 --> 00:34:07.878
You're scarily accurate.

00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:13.582
You might need to train for that
if you're staying with Prince Davin.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.384
I'm the type who uses my heart,
not weapons.

00:34:20.772 --> 00:34:21.562
You're so handsome.

00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:22.678
Lava!

00:34:34.308 --> 00:34:35.207
How are you?

00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:36.788
Are you tired from the flight?

00:34:37.943 --> 00:34:38.750
Not at all.

00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:41.363
I could fly even longer,
if someone's waiting for me.

00:34:43.468 --> 00:34:44.861
You're starting here already.

00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:48.103
Let's go inside.

00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:49.898
Father and Mother are waiting.

00:34:50.976 --> 00:34:51.669
Okay.

00:34:53.569 --> 00:34:54.633
Thanks, Paolo.

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:06.754
Follow me.

00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:23.293
You helped our family so much.

00:35:23.832 --> 00:35:26.124
We must honor you with a title.

00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:30.103
Give him a big one, Father.

00:35:30.103 --> 00:35:33.810
He took care of Davin like a VIP.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.910
It's okay, Your Highness.

00:35:38.577 --> 00:35:43.865
I'm here because Prince Davin
Everett Delroy of Arantha invited me.

00:35:45.405 --> 00:35:47.089
No need for the full name.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.891
We're friends. Just call me Davin.

00:35:50.096 --> 00:35:51.907
I even memorized it.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.548
Lava doesn't want anything, Father.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.654
He just wanted to visit

00:35:59.501 --> 00:36:00.892
and spend time with me.

00:36:02.278 --> 00:36:03.850
Make sure you take care of him well.

00:36:04.826 --> 00:36:06.230
Let me know if you need anything.

00:36:07.591 --> 00:36:09.010
Since he came all the way here,

00:36:09.626 --> 00:36:12.209
we should take good care of him,
just like he took care of us.

00:36:13.903 --> 00:36:15.506
I'll take good care of him, don't worry.

00:36:16.045 --> 00:36:17.508
Arantha's reputation is safe.

00:36:19.973 --> 00:36:21.745
I'll make him not even want
to go back home.

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:31.699
Come in.

00:36:45.434 --> 00:36:46.722
This room is huge.

00:36:46.927 --> 00:36:50.173
Big or not, I'm still sleeping alone.

00:36:50.584 --> 00:36:51.975
It's still better than the resort.

00:36:51.975 --> 00:36:54.434
We had to squeeze into that tiny bed.

00:36:54.716 --> 00:36:59.671
But that was warm. I liked it more.

00:37:57.806 --> 00:37:58.615
It's weird.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.097
I feel like it's my first time,

00:38:05.177 --> 00:38:08.232
but you said we've done it
many times already.

00:38:11.184 --> 00:38:11.843
Of course.

00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:15.238
I remember every part of you.

00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:20.198
I know exactly where each part is
and what your scent smells like.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.498
Hey, enough.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.099
I believe you now.

00:38:25.689 --> 00:38:26.947
You have a great memory.

00:38:33.854 --> 00:38:35.902
I'll try to make time to take you sightseeing.

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:39.300
But we probably can't go just the two of us.

00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:43.022
Guards must be accompanying us.

00:38:43.318 --> 00:38:45.510
Then we won't have any time alone?

00:38:49.515 --> 00:38:53.211
We'll have to meet in secret rooms
or hidden places.

00:38:54.879 --> 00:38:56.299
I don't want people to suspect anything.

00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:02.033
Now I understand how Dr. Wut felt
dating Uncle Peng.

00:39:03.111 --> 00:39:04.125
Please understand me.

00:39:05.742 --> 00:39:12.080
Like I said, Father wants me
to rebuild my reputation since I was away.

00:39:13.749 --> 00:39:16.322
Image is important.

00:39:23.331 --> 00:39:27.277
Then can I go to work with you?

00:39:30.358 --> 00:39:31.801
Would you like that?

00:39:33.034 --> 00:39:34.962
It's basically just charity stuff

00:39:36.117 --> 00:39:39.146
and visiting kids in hospitals.

00:39:42.252 --> 00:39:43.226
I'd love it.

00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:45.762
I love kids, and kids love me.

00:39:48.047 --> 00:39:49.700
But what would your role be?

00:39:50.111 --> 00:39:52.831
My friend? My boyfriend?

00:39:54.423 --> 00:39:55.559
Or my royal bodyguard?

00:39:57.151 --> 00:39:59.190
Anything you want.

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.741
I'm ready to follow your orders.

00:40:16.684 --> 00:40:19.135
I've been training in music since I was five.

00:40:19.582 --> 00:40:22.113
I played both guitar and piano.

00:40:22.318 --> 00:40:24.652
Music helps me focus.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.090
And I use it to let out my feelings,

00:40:28.372 --> 00:40:30.902
whether I'm happy,

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.560
sad,

00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:51.885
angry,

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.990
or even in love.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.183
So, who here wants to be a musician?

00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:18.884
Me!

00:41:24.067 --> 00:41:26.241
Kids, look over here.

00:41:26.241 --> 00:41:27.586
This way, please.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:29.199
Look at this camera, please.

00:41:30.637 --> 00:41:32.845
Boy, could you move a little closer?

00:41:33.025 --> 00:41:34.507
That's right.

00:41:37.806 --> 00:41:39.321
I'm sorry. Could you step aside a bit?

00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:40.718
You're in the frame.

00:41:41.591 --> 00:41:42.368
I'm sorry.

00:41:43.769 --> 00:41:45.396
You can include Lava too.

00:41:45.524 --> 00:41:47.242
He's my friend from Thailand.

00:41:51.298 --> 00:41:54.678
It's okay. I don't want to trouble you.

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.000
Please go ahead.

00:41:56.745 --> 00:41:58.495
But I want you in the photo.

00:42:05.855 --> 00:42:07.055
Come closer.

00:42:12.066 --> 00:42:13.194
Look at the camera.

00:42:13.682 --> 00:42:15.994
One, two, three.

00:42:16.328 --> 00:42:18.624
Kids, smile.

00:42:45.588 --> 00:42:48.200
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:42:51.204 --> 00:42:52.880
Why didn't you come to send me off?

00:42:54.112 --> 00:42:55.751
You left me waiting at the pier for so long.

00:42:58.293 --> 00:43:00.190
I did go, but I was late.

00:43:00.524 --> 00:43:02.882
I'm not good at saying goodbye.

00:43:03.293 --> 00:43:06.209
I didn't want our last moment
to be a sad one.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.477
I wanted to remember us happy.

00:43:09.607 --> 00:43:10.698
You can choose what to remember?

00:43:12.444 --> 00:43:13.501
That must be nice.

00:43:15.298 --> 00:43:18.436
People like you can get happy so easily.

00:43:19.318 --> 00:43:21.343
Easily? Not at all.

00:43:21.343 --> 00:43:22.305
Who said that?

00:43:22.613 --> 00:43:25.940
Before you called me, I was totally a mess.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.974
I have a heart too, you know.

00:43:36.103 --> 00:43:36.842
Are you sulking?

00:43:41.232 --> 00:43:44.645
You're kind of cute when you sulk.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:44:00.283
You know what helps me remember everything that happened on the island?

00:44:03.826 --> 00:44:04.659
Songs.

00:44:06.995 --> 00:44:09.686
The song I used to listen to on
Uncle Peng's CD player.

00:44:11.868 --> 00:44:15.228
When I came back here, I looked it up.

00:44:17.385 --> 00:44:21.907
I remembered I used to listen
to this song with you.

00:44:59.624 --> 00:45:07.173
♪ The sky, the sea, and the breeze exist ♪

00:45:07.173 --> 00:45:14.052

♪ The moon and stars you dream of ♪

00:45:56.251 --> 00:45:58.258
Hey, you're a prince now.

00:45:58.258 --> 00:45:59.344
Do you still have to be scared
of your subordinates?

00:46:01.446 --> 00:46:05.387
I just don't want them gossiping
that I'm on a date with a friend.

00:46:06.491 --> 00:46:13.004

That's good.

00:46:38.159 --> 00:46:39.576
Your shot is pretty accurate.

00:46:39.756 --> 00:46:41.282
You just need a bit more practice.

00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:44.021
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:46:44.945 --> 00:46:46.797
I want to get even better,

00:46:47.336 --> 00:46:49.214
so I can protect the person I love.

00:46:52.269 --> 00:46:53.149
Good.

00:46:53.842 --> 00:46:56.368
As men, it's our duty to protect women.

00:47:06.331 --> 00:47:08.062
Your Majesty.

00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:10.262
You're right on time, Kate.

00:47:11.931 --> 00:47:13.786
Is there anything you'd like me
to do for you, Your Majesty?

00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:16.258
Nothing much.

00:47:17.182 --> 00:47:23.141
I want you to help advise Davin
on diplomatic communication.

00:47:24.399 --> 00:47:26.842
He'll soon have to take the throne,

00:47:27.484 --> 00:47:31.495
and I want him guided
by someone experienced.

00:47:31.983 --> 00:47:35.749
Of course, but I'm not that good yet.

00:47:38.727 --> 00:47:41.967
Kate, this is Lava.

00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:46.683
He's my friend from Thailand.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:47.874
Hello.

00:47:48.593 --> 00:47:50.806
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lava.

00:47:57.584 --> 00:48:00.651
Davin, take Kate inside.

00:48:00.933 --> 00:48:03.112
Lava and I will continue shooting.

00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:21.862
The ambassador's daughter is exactly
the type of woman who suits Davin.

00:48:29.689 --> 00:48:31.523
Don't rush, Father.

00:48:33.217 --> 00:48:35.945
Let Davin decide for himself.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.156
The ambassador's daughter is cute, isn't she?

00:48:59.799 --> 00:49:03.528
I'm sorry I never told you about this.

00:49:05.813 --> 00:49:06.907
I get it.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.283
The king wants his son
to marry a beautiful woman.

00:49:11.721 --> 00:49:14.215
But you're not actually
going through with it, right?

00:49:23.997 --> 00:49:29.956
Don't tell me you'd really marry someone
you don't feel anything for?

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:31.233
Would you lie to her?

00:49:31.438 --> 00:49:32.848
Then what do you want me to do?

00:49:33.259 --> 00:49:35.724
My life isn't that simple.

00:49:35.724 --> 00:49:36.647
It's simple.

00:49:36.647 --> 00:49:38.361
You're the one making it complicated.

00:49:38.618 --> 00:49:42.161
So you think if I just walked in
and said I like men,

00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:44.651
everything would be fine?

00:49:45.806 --> 00:49:49.048
That we'd get a happily-ever-after?

00:49:50.588 --> 00:49:51.994
You're making it sound too easy.

00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:55.427
You never have to think about anyone.

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.417
You never have anyone
you need to think about.

00:49:57.417 --> 00:49:58.723
That's the right thing to do.

00:49:59.057 --> 00:50:00.677
Why should we live for other people?

00:50:00.805 --> 00:50:03.651
Why be a puppet with no feelings,
no happiness?

00:50:04.113 --> 00:50:05.413
What do you want me to do?

00:50:06.543 --> 00:50:09.166
My life was set for me—

00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:12.990
what I must do, what I must be,

00:50:14.274 --> 00:50:15.510
and even who I must love.

00:50:17.307 --> 00:50:19.080
We can choose our own path.

00:50:19.491 --> 00:50:20.854
We don't have to listen to anyone.

00:50:24.269 --> 00:50:27.943
I used to think Prince Davin and Wave
were the same person,

00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:33.580
but now I don't think so

00:50:34.915 --> 00:50:37.580
because Wave is so much braver.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.770
How could you say that?!

00:50:39.463 --> 00:50:41.756
Wave has nothing to lose.

00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:43.426
He has no past to remember.

00:50:44.222 --> 00:50:46.167
His whole life is only you!

00:51:20.786 --> 00:51:21.732
I'm sorry.

00:51:24.351 --> 00:51:26.084
I didn't mean to insult you.

00:51:27.214 --> 00:51:33.729
Sometimes I wish I could be brave like you.

00:51:36.091 --> 00:51:39.493
Uncle Peng once said
I should try to understand others,

00:51:40.982 --> 00:51:42.312
not just myself.

00:51:50.795 --> 00:51:55.385
But I never thought our story
would end up like this.

00:51:59.287 --> 00:52:00.976
I came all the way here,

00:52:04.878 --> 00:52:06.008
but in the end,

00:52:06.983 --> 00:52:11.505
what we had was only a summer memory.

00:52:21.798 --> 00:52:24.687
I think I'll go back to Thailand.

00:52:30.233 --> 00:52:34.302
You don't want to stay with me anymore?

00:52:37.537 --> 00:52:38.370
I do.

00:52:40.527 --> 00:52:41.594
But if I stay,

00:52:43.699 --> 00:52:45.955
both of us will be even more uneasy.

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.565
Then can you wait for me?

00:52:54.619 --> 00:52:56.489
I don't know how long it'll take,

00:52:59.955 --> 00:53:01.476
but I'll try my best.

00:53:03.145 --> 00:53:05.342
When you're ready, you can come back.

00:53:06.369 --> 00:53:08.016
I'll be waiting in my place.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:11.972
Wait for me.

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.045
Just give me some time.

00:53:21.627 --> 00:53:22.820
I promise.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.318
I'll wait for you.

00:53:57.856 --> 00:54:00.809
ONE YEAR LATER

00:54:22.087 --> 00:54:25.324
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

00:54:25.466 --> 00:54:27.434
I would've closed the shop for you.

00:54:27.661 --> 00:54:29.217
Then it wouldn't have been a surprise.

00:54:29.416 --> 00:54:31.921
Man, you've changed Honey's bar so much.

00:54:32.085 --> 00:54:34.197
I didn't think you had such good taste.

00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:37.785
It's not his taste, but mine.

00:54:37.984 --> 00:54:39.236
We just spent his money.

00:54:43.893 --> 00:54:50.085
Tum, I've noticed your TikTok followers
have gone up a lot.

00:54:50.539 --> 00:54:52.593
I've been creating
couple content with Kratae.

00:54:52.593 --> 00:54:54.560
The shop got popular
and customers increased.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:55:00.321
You know, the money I used to take over Honey's place
all came from those couple videos.

00:55:00.747 --> 00:55:03.615
And once Kratae got on camera…

00:55:04.154 --> 00:55:05.328
Don't say it.

00:55:05.328 --> 00:55:07.340
Now she wants to be a TikTok star.

00:55:07.965 --> 00:55:09.406
And Honey?

00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:13.432
She's abroad now.

00:55:13.432 --> 00:55:14.311
She's got a foreign boyfriend.

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:16.652
She's moving to Germany
and getting married.

00:55:16.652 --> 00:55:18.601
How lucky she is!

00:55:18.601 --> 00:55:19.359
Yeah.

00:55:20.068 --> 00:55:22.151
Everyone's lucky in love.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.888
Guess I'm the only one.

00:55:27.234 --> 00:55:31.938
So you're really not talking
to Prince Davin of Arantha at all?

00:55:35.033 --> 00:55:36.096
No.

00:55:36.635 --> 00:55:38.483
He has his world,

00:55:38.483 --> 00:55:42.427
and I have to move on with mine.

00:55:43.762 --> 00:55:45.370
It's okay, Lava.

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:49.249
I'm sure someday you'll meet the person who's truly right for you.

00:55:49.618 --> 00:55:50.371
Mm.

00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:51.443
It's fine.

00:55:51.443 --> 00:55:53.725
I'm not trying to replace him anyway.

00:55:53.952 --> 00:55:55.728
Memories can't be replaced.

00:55:55.728 --> 00:55:59.100
Oh come on, stop pulling it into sadness.

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.230
No more.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.943
Since you're here, we're getting drunk.

00:56:04.255 --> 00:56:05.818
Drunk again?

00:56:07.181 --> 00:56:08.767
It's a special occasion.

00:56:08.767 --> 00:56:10.795
Our friend's here, right?

00:56:13.407 --> 00:56:15.644
You always use that excuse.

00:56:15.644 --> 00:56:18.584
Last time was a special occasion,
and today is another special occasion.

00:56:18.584 --> 00:56:23.052
Oh, Kratae, look at our friend's face.

00:56:23.052 --> 00:56:24.100
Look.

00:56:24.469 --> 00:56:26.516
He looks like a sad puppy.

00:56:27.304 --> 00:56:28.849
Just a little, okay?

00:56:29.133 --> 00:56:30.095
Fine.

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:37.302
Do you want one?

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:41.503
He has already planned where the kid will study—

00:56:41.503 --> 00:56:44.272
kindergarten, primary, secondary.

00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:46.404
The baby's only a few years old.

00:56:47.597 --> 00:56:49.765
We have to plan ahead, Doc.

00:56:49.964 --> 00:56:51.723
Our kid deserves the best.

00:56:56.266 --> 00:56:57.331
Do you want one?

00:56:58.694 --> 00:57:01.544
So, Dr. Wut, how's work at the hospital?

00:57:02.396 --> 00:57:04.917
It's much better.

00:57:05.343 --> 00:57:07.105
We just got new medical equipment

00:57:07.417 --> 00:57:09.881
and funding to build a patient ward.

00:57:10.846 --> 00:57:13.984
Thanks to donations
from the prince's foundation.

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:16.514
Prince?

00:57:16.855 --> 00:57:18.167
Prince Davin.

00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:20.734
He didn't tell you?

00:57:27.007 --> 00:57:30.193
Ever since I came back,
we haven't contacted each other at all.

00:57:32.777 --> 00:57:37.841
He sent people to donate money
to both the hospital and the school.

00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:40.086
We built a huge new music room.

00:57:40.796 --> 00:57:42.474
He must really love this island.

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.745
If you have time, you should go see it.

00:57:46.824 --> 00:57:49.624
Alright. If I have time, I'll go.

00:57:52.577 --> 00:57:54.121
So how long are you staying?

00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:58.963
Until Uncle Peng's new resort is finished.

00:57:58.963 --> 00:58:00.614
I already quit my job,

00:58:00.614 --> 00:58:01.950
so I'll probably stay for months.

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:04.743
Make yourself at home.

00:58:05.169 --> 00:58:06.676
Your room's still the same.

00:58:09.998 --> 00:58:11.563
Then I'll excuse myself for now.

00:58:12.159 --> 00:58:12.848
Yeah.

00:58:22.327 --> 00:58:23.700
Sweetie, do you want this?

00:58:23.927 --> 00:58:25.119
Here you go.

00:58:25.573 --> 00:58:26.449
Do you want some milk?

00:58:28.351 --> 00:58:30.102
Daddy will go get your milk, okay?

01:00:56.071 --> 01:00:58.487
It's alright. I'll do it myself.

01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:05.939
Are you asleep, Davin?

01:02:06.734 --> 01:02:09.299
No. What's up, Anya?

01:02:21.348 --> 01:02:23.162
Take good care of yourself.

01:02:23.446 --> 01:02:24.581
A big event is approaching.

01:02:27.165 --> 01:02:28.277
I know.

01:02:29.697 --> 01:02:32.778
I'm just letting my mind wander.

01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:36.765
Wandering all the way to that island
in Thailand too?

01:02:49.003 --> 01:02:51.177
I know you miss him a lot.

01:02:52.114 --> 01:02:53.913
But since things have come this far,

01:02:54.169 --> 01:02:58.384
and if you've made your choice,
then you have to live with it and be happy.

01:03:03.523 --> 01:03:08.729
So that means I have to lie to myself
for the rest of my life?

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:15.770
Davin, what matters most is your happiness.

01:03:18.297 --> 01:03:23.279
But no matter what you choose,
someone will be affected.

01:03:27.254 --> 01:03:30.120
If you choose to be Arantha's king,

01:03:31.369 --> 01:03:33.240
I'll stand by you

01:03:34.234 --> 01:03:36.690
and fight anyone who tries to hurt us.

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:41.023
But if you choose love,

01:03:42.982 --> 01:03:44.757
I'll also be right here,

01:03:46.688 --> 01:03:49.230
listening to all the sweet stories
you brag about,

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:53.008
and giving advice
when you're sulking at Lava.

01:03:59.425 --> 01:04:03.442
So you won't think I'm too selfish?

01:04:04.748 --> 01:04:05.982
Not at all.

01:04:07.629 --> 01:04:10.150
I see it as bravery.

01:04:16.766 --> 01:04:18.234
And more importantly,

01:04:18.887 --> 01:04:20.561
no matter what happens,

01:04:21.782 --> 01:04:22.876
keep this in mind.

01:04:24.154 --> 01:04:25.896
I'll never leave you.

01:04:51.426 --> 01:04:54.876
Then can you help me with something?

01:04:59.078 --> 01:05:00.105
What is it?

01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:03.223
Why did you call us in so late at night?

01:05:06.886 --> 01:05:08.117
Say it, son.

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:10.025
You can tell us anything.

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.163
Father, Mother…

01:05:20.485 --> 01:05:23.363
I can't be the next king of Arantha.

01:05:28.218 --> 01:05:30.819
Why, son? What happened?

01:05:32.977 --> 01:05:36.184
It's a position inherited
under the rules of Arantha,

01:05:37.575 --> 01:05:42.529
and I don't believe
I have the qualities to be a good king.

01:05:43.296 --> 01:05:44.854
But you're my son.

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:46.383
Why wouldn't you be able to?

01:05:49.592 --> 01:05:51.129
I'm a prince

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.142
who doesn't want a princess by his side.

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:01.318
I'm a prince

01:06:03.845 --> 01:06:06.280
who wants a prince of his own instead.

01:06:28.546 --> 01:06:30.834
I respect what you've built,

01:06:32.452 --> 01:06:34.513
and I respect our royal bloodline,

01:06:36.501 --> 01:06:38.272
but that's not who I am.

01:06:40.374 --> 01:06:42.782
I just want to live with the person I love.

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:53.523
That's all I am.

01:06:57.242 --> 01:07:02.462
And I want everyone to accept me.

01:07:18.699 --> 01:07:20.883
Son, I've never been disappointed in you.

01:07:22.445 --> 01:07:26.383
Life's too short to keep lying to yourself.

01:07:27.604 --> 01:07:32.260
Being a prince doesn't just determine
who you'll love.

01:07:33.396 --> 01:07:38.441
It's more about
having the courage to accept yourself.

01:07:49.763 --> 01:07:55.258
I'm sorry if I made you feel pressured,

01:07:57.501 --> 01:07:59.571
especially about finding you a partner.

01:08:02.439 --> 01:08:04.273
Give me time to learn.

01:08:06.772 --> 01:08:08.304
I love you,

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:15.308
and you'll always be Arantha's heir.

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:30.571
Anya, you knew?

01:08:30.969 --> 01:08:32.920
Why didn't you tell me?

01:08:35.532 --> 01:08:37.111
For something like this,

01:08:37.565 --> 01:08:41.140
it's better to let the person say it himself.

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:52.328
You mentioned the person you love.

01:08:53.066 --> 01:08:54.105
Who is it?

01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:08.955
The one who gave me a new life, Father.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.707
I still have something else to say.

01:09:22.707 --> 01:09:23.636
What?

01:09:24.601 --> 01:09:26.374
More surprise?

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:34.995
I believe the one who should rule
Arantha next is Anya.

01:09:36.244 --> 01:09:40.106
Davin, let's talk about this later.

01:09:40.674 --> 01:09:44.271
If I don't say it, you never will.

01:09:47.394 --> 01:09:50.423
Anya led our family through the crisis.

01:09:52.694 --> 01:09:56.478
I think she's the most suitable person.

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:02.638
Even if our rules never had this,

01:10:03.944 --> 01:10:08.704
I think it's time for a change.

01:11:09.388 --> 01:11:10.228
Hey!

01:11:16.957 --> 01:11:17.670
Prince!

01:11:18.039 --> 01:11:18.756
Prince!

01:11:21.283 --> 01:11:22.208
Prince!

01:11:22.407 --> 01:11:23.589
Prince!

01:11:24.043 --> 01:11:25.148
Prince!

01:11:25.659 --> 01:11:27.422
Hey, Prince!

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:32.298
Aren't you going to save me?

01:11:38.232 --> 01:11:39.676
How did you get here?

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:46.388
I took a boat, but it broke apart.

01:11:46.842 --> 01:11:50.560
So I ended up
washed ashore on this island by chance.

01:11:51.241 --> 01:11:52.632
Stop joking.

01:11:52.916 --> 01:11:54.381
How did you get here?

01:11:54.381 --> 01:11:55.913
Where are your bodyguards?

01:11:58.809 --> 01:12:00.261
No one came.

01:12:01.454 --> 01:12:02.988
I came alone.

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:06.395
And more importantly,

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:10.008
I'm staying here.

01:12:11.921 --> 01:12:13.667
How can you stay here?

01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:15.783
Who's going to rule Arantha?

01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:19.533
The one who's more suitable than me.

01:12:20.811 --> 01:12:25.644
Someone like me belongs with the sea,

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:30.125
the mountains, the nature,

01:12:33.873 --> 01:12:35.792
and the person I love.

01:12:40.704 --> 01:12:41.381
Hey.

01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:43.507
Don't tell me you ran away from the palace.

01:12:43.507 --> 01:12:45.430
I'm not involved. I don't want trouble.

01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:46.902
I didn't run away.

01:12:47.981 --> 01:12:51.544
My family lets me do what I want now.

01:12:52.879 --> 01:12:54.734
I can go wherever I want

01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:58.911
and love whoever I want.

01:13:01.012 --> 01:13:02.874
I can do anything that makes me happy,

01:13:03.101 --> 01:13:06.336
and they'll be happy too.

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:17.092
Here, I'm not Prince Davin.

01:13:18.938 --> 01:13:23.752
But I'm Wave, Nava Mahasamut,

01:13:26.478 --> 01:13:28.581
the one who belongs to you, always.

01:13:40.926 --> 01:13:45.365
If our first kiss was the one
where I saved your life,

01:14:00.048 --> 01:14:01.094
then this one…

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:04.552
you saved mine.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.999
Then let's keep kissing
for the rest of our lives.

01:14:45.425 --> 01:14:49.247
I told you I'd make it grander
than Uncle Peng's, right?

01:14:51.746 --> 01:14:52.666
Here it is.

01:14:53.347 --> 01:14:55.235
I want to propose in the middle of the ocean.

01:14:58.472 --> 01:15:02.055
You carry the ring with you all the time?

01:15:04.496 --> 01:15:05.884
Of course I do.

01:15:06.907 --> 01:15:09.086
You never know when the moment will come.

01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:19.246
Wave, will you marry me?

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:35.111
Well, since I gave up the throne,

01:15:36.673 --> 01:15:38.247
I guess we're getting married.

01:15:48.186 --> 01:15:49.365
Excuse me.

01:16:08.525 --> 01:16:13.401
From now on, my life belongs to you.

01:16:15.587 --> 01:16:16.827
It's “our.”

01:16:19.099 --> 01:16:20.987
Our lives belong to each other.

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:07.191
Whoa.

01:18:07.191 --> 01:18:09.451
We've actually been through a lot
since the very first day.

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:12.036
- Oh, we went through so much —
- Exactly.

01:18:12.036 --> 01:18:13.258
- The sea.
-The heat.

01:18:13.258 --> 01:18:14.119
- The sand.
- The island.

01:18:14.119 --> 01:18:14.619
The wind.

01:18:14.619 --> 01:18:15.185
The rain.

01:18:15.185 --> 01:18:15.970
The palace.

01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:17.167
The house.

01:18:17.167 --> 01:18:17.680
The kids.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.500
Yes, but everything has passed now.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.074
Please look forward to watching it.

01:18:21.074 --> 01:18:24.495
All the actors and the whole team
put so much effort into this

01:18:24.495 --> 01:18:26.415
even though they're not here
to speak right now.

01:18:26.415 --> 01:18:27.534
They've already gone home —

01:18:27.534 --> 01:18:28.702
they're totally fine, by the way.

01:18:28.702 --> 01:18:30.321
So yes, please support us, everyone.

01:18:30.719 --> 01:18:31.439
Yay!

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.782
Thank you.
