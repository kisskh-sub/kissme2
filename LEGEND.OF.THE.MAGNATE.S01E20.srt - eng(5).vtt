[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.920
[Episode 20]

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.590
How weird.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.430
Does he have any enemies?

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.950
Yes.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.950
He has a grudge against this man.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.640
Gu Pingwen,

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.300
how could you say that?

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.450
Your Highness,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.460
I'm merely serving

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.350
as the humble head

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.680
of the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.479
There used to be some misunderstandings

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.680
between Mr. Gu and me.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.380
But ever since he earned

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.040
the reputation
as the Top Tea Under Heaven,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.410
it has brought great honor

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.740
to our Anhui Tea Merchants' Association.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.890
I-I feel nothing

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.630
but sincere gratitude toward him.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.289
How could I possibly hurt him?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.870
Mr. Gu Pingwen,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.430
you shouldn't talk nonsense like that.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.290
Your Highness,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.360
I have already dispatched

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.470
all the tea merchants

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.480
from the Anhui Association in the capital

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.360
to search everywhere

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.710
for Mr. Gu.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.640
Your Highness.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm putting you
in charge of finding this person,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.150
so that when the Empress Dowager

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.960
asks me about it,
I will have something to say.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.690
Understood.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.960
The Empress Dowager

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.020
likes your Orchid Snow tea very much.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.360
Prepare 2 baskets of tea.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.120
I'll send someone

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.280
to collect them later.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.800
Also,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.680
when you find your brother,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.190
tell him to send a message to my mansion.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.120
I wish to see him.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.610
Farewell, Your Highness.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.590
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680
Go away.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.310
Mr. Gu,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.190
I think

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.750
you should hurry

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.520
to get the tea ready.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.560
You can totally entrust

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.290
Mr. Gu Pingyuan's matter to me.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680
Entrust it to you?

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.310
Had you not been constantly

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.520
bullying my brother and me,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.120
would he have suffered this?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.210
It's been so many days already.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.000
Mr. Gu,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.030
just do me

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.240
a favor,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.000
please...

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.280
It's the tea
that the Empress Dowager asks for.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.710
This is no trivial matter.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.570
Oh my goodness.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.870
Hurry up.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.079
Go.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.310
Hou Er!

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.400
Coming!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.090
Come out!

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.990
Old Master Hu!

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.400
What's wrong, Old Master Hu?

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.940
You bastard.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.010
Get on your knees!

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.310
Wait.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.840
Today, you should

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.930
kneel

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.160
inside this circle.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.630
Don't be mad. Well...

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.840
Let me explain it in detail.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.750
Wait, Old Master Hu!

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.120
Old Master Hu, please...

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.180
Stay on your knees!

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.100
Who are you?

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.640
Where are you taking me?

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.130
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.480
Rise.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.680
Bring a seat for the Sixth Prince.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.290
I am Qiao Song, Governor of Anhui.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.000
For your visit to Anhui this time,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.560
if you need

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.159
anything else from the imperial court,

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.290
you can tell the Sixth Prince about it.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.540
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.240
The battle in Anhui is over.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.480
I will follow Marquis Zuo

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.920
to reclaim the Northwest.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.240
Marquis Zuo wrote to me,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.560
asking me to purchase more foreign guns

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.159
and cannons from the inland to strengthen

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.310
our military supplies.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.950
However,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.950
it's extremely difficult to buy
even a single gun,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.810
and foreign gunpowder is
not easy to come by either.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.240
You can never trust
those foreigners when doing

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.440
arms deals with them.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.400
Some days ago,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.600
a customs official told me

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.270
that they bought

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.800
a warship from a British man

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.270
called Timothy.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560
And guess what?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.410
They took our Qing Empire's money,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.600
yet they still insisted
on keeping control of the ship

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.130
and only hired foreigners.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.880
Our people

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.750
weren't even allowed to take a look at it.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.810
How could they do business like this?

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.950
I already told Hart.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.240
Even if we have to give up the money,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.160
we must not let

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.430
these untrustworthy foreigners

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.800
walk all over us.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.960
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.510
Timothy is no more

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.720
than an unscrupulous British businessman.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.540
But if we let Mr. Hart

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.730
go negotiate with the German captain,

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.950
they would be

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.120
willing to return the money.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.980
What's the use of getting it back?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.750
After all that hassle,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.460
we end up getting nothing.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.530
What's
the Office of General Management doing?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.750
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.800
Anyway, I failed

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.070
in my duty.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.830
Rise, Sixth Prince.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.000
I'm not blaming you.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.920
About purchasing foreign firearms,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.800
go discuss it with Hart.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.750
If our forces
return defeated due to a lack

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.510
of sufficient arms
to reclaim the Northwest,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.310
causing the imperial censors to lose it,

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.970
I won't be able to protect you.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.600
Also, go ask

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.870
those merchants who trade with foreigners

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.330
to see if they can get some.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.530
Little by little, we'll get there.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.560
Let me go first when we talk to him later.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.210
Understood.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.120
Look at him.

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:46.070
Mr. Hart.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.630
[Hart, Maritime Customs Service]

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.480
Sixth Prince!

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.040
Sup?

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.750
Oh!

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.070
You sound more like a local than I do!

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.890
I just guessed

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.530
you weren't at the government office

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.330
and were chilling here instead.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.200
Come on, have a seat.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.920
Mr. Hart,

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.120
I am the Governor of Anhui.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.800
Waiter!

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.820
Two more premium ones.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.920
Coming!

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.220
Our shop just got some Orchid Snow tea,

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.910
the Top Tea Under Heaven.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.720
Mr. Hart, would you like to order some

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.870
for your two friends?

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.270
You're really ripping people off.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.160
Even the Empress Dowager

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.120
only got 2 taels.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:26.790
Off you go.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.310
Cut it out.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.040
Yes, sir.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.520
Sixth Prince,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.039
where's the tea you promised me?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.960
I didn't fool you.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.750
This gentleman is

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.600
the current Governor of Anhui,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.390
Qiao Song.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.000
He's in charge

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.150
of all the Anhui tea.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.880
Yes, indeed.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.690
From now on,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.320
if you want Orchid Snow tea,

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.950
just ask him about it.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.130
The Orchid Snow tea is

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.510
going viral everywhere.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.440
My ears are tired of hearing about it.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.120
But

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.260
I haven't had a single sip yet.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.790
Sorry for that.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.830
Sixth Prince,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.240
if you keep paying lip service,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.610
I won't be able to help you.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.630
Please don't.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.820
How about this?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.080
Well, I

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.120
just requested 2 baskets of tea

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.920
to offer to the Empress Dowager.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.490
Can't take more than that,

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.000
but I can try to keep

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.130
2 taels of it for you.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.280
There's no problem.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.000
I'll take care of it.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.120
Good.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.550
Mr. Qiao,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.610
go ahead with your matter.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.480
Mr. Hart,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.390
I,

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.510
by order of the Empress Dowager,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.390
will go to the Northwest

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.750
to reclaim our lost territories
after seizing Hefei.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.750
However, our guns and ammunition are

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.880
in severe shortage.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.670
Could you please help us

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.790
order some from Germany?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.000
The Office of General Management.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.610
sent this here yesterday.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.290
The capital's Tiger Spirit Battalion alone

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.200
[1,000 guns with 200,000 bullets
for the capital's Tiger Spirit Battalion.]

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.200
wants 1,000 guns

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.790
with 200,000 bullets,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.790
20 breech-loading howitzers,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.120
and 50,000 shells.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.270
All these behind are

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.000
orders from your provinces.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.000
You know,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.550
you must report
to the Office of General Management first

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.610
before I can process it.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.480
[Order]

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.720
Mr. Hart,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.870
please just spare 200 guns for me.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.600
The imperial court's
Tiger Spirit Battalion is

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.320
guarding the capital.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.080
They won't need

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.550
so many anytime soon.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.720
But I have to consider

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.120
the first-come, first-served principle.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.000
I really can't wait for a year or more.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.360
I'll lose my position.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.840
Or how about we request
an imperial decree?

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.120
No imperial edict can help.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.440
The Krupp foundry

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.640
doesn't listen to the Empress Dowager.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.480
The earliest batch of firearms

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.420
won't arrive until next spring.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.390
You'll have to

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.790
go to Qingdao and collect them yourselves.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.510
Waiter!

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.840
Mr. Hart.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.000
Here you are.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.050
Please help us figure out a way.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.080
I suggest you

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.360
go talk to the God of Wealth.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.870
Businessmen are

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.570
much more efficient

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.730
than the imperial court
in handling these matters.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.680
The God of Wealth has

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.000
plenty more people asking for favors.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.860
How could it possibly be my turn?

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.270
Just recently, I finally managed

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.800
to ask Gu Pingyuan for help.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.000
And guess what?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.840
He's gone missing!

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.270
Old Master Hu,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.150
let me go find Gu Pingyuan!

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.480
There's no use doing it that way.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.360
What's the point of you

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.690
getting bad in the room?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.520
Straighten it up before moving.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.330
Everyone, take it slow.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.270
Place the boxes against the wall

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.870
and arrange them in proper order.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.790
Old Master Hu,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.760
please let me go find Gu Pingyuan.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.480
Old Master Hu!

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.030
Let me go look for Gu Pingyuan!

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.360
-I'll get Gu Pingyuan back for you!
-Which Gu Pingyuan?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.120
Okay?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.460
Which Gu Pingyuan are you talking about?

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.280
What's it got to do with you?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.000
Is it the Gu Pingyuan from Anhui?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.270
A tall, young man?

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.080
You've seen him?

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.440
My dear lady,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.390
please! Please tell me

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.480
where Gu Pingyuan is, will you?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.480
Please tell me...

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.210
Did he really come to Beijing?

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.800
Wait,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.360
you don't know that?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.510
Then why are you messing around here?

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.080
Off you go.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.790
Old Master Hu!

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.510
Someone is here to visit Mr. Gu Pingyuan!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.030
Who? Who is it?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.840
Why is everyone looking for Gu Pingyuan?

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.630
Are you looking for Gu Pingyuan?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.550
Greetings, Old Master Hu.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.480
Isn't this Li Wantang's son,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.270
young Mr. Li?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:35.960
Well...

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.760
Yes, it's me.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.670
Do you know where Gu Pingyuan is?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.090
Look at the trouble you've caused!

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:45.910
What are you doing?

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.970
Everyone's looking for Gu Pingyuan!

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.840
Do you know where we are?

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.910
Ningguta.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.760
Commander Xu,

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.670
how have you been?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.550
I asked his brother.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.840
He said they sent that man surnamed Hou

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.440
to rent a carriage

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.440
with the Thirteen Great Guardians
to pick him up.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.340
And he passed out
after drinking a cup of tea.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.360
When he woke up,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.150
both the people
and the carriage were gone.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.120
Did he antagonize someone?

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.840
Or was he kidnapped by bandits?

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.500
But there should have been
some kind of message.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:55.670
I need to find him.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.670
Where would you even start looking?

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.000
The Tea Merchants' Association offered
tens of thousands of taels

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.200
of silver as a reward.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.030
So many people have
searched for him but failed.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.790
North, south, east, or west,

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.990
at least you need to know the direction.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.960
Come with me
to ask the major escort agencies

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.290
in the capital about it.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.750
They're on the way every day,

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.320
so they might have seen something.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.069
Your stomach is full of ice.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.900
If you get near the fire,
your internal organs will be damaged.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200
Don't worry.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.510
Two hours later,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.280
I'll take you outside again.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.690
Before you freeze to death,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.850
I'll definitely bring you back in.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.440
Comfortable?

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.750
Want to sleep?

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.840
No way.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.200
If you're asleep, who else can I talk to?

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.680
If you want to sleep now, I'll just

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.110
take you outside to cool off again.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.070
Wait! Hear me out. Wait.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.550
You're just

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.260
trying to torture me a little longer.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.030
If I freeze to death,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.190
who will
keep you company in this game? Huh?

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.150
You need to keep me alive.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.700
I'm starving right now.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.910
Give me something to eat.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.440
Please.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.550
Have some wine.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.740
It's been quite a while since you escaped

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.880
to lead that dreamlike life,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.480
and now you've finally woken up.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.650
Was it worth it?

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.310
Yes.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.470
Absolutely worth it.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.160
The places I've been are

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.790
somewhere you'll never reach
in your lifetime.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.650
Are there places more prosperous

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.300
than Fengtian?

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.000
Fengtian.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.200
So that is

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.840
the best place
you've ever been to in your life.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.940
After I escaped from here,

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.390
I went to the vast grassland.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.030
There,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.270
tens of thousands of herdsmen

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.260
fought against each other

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.080
for a stretch of grassland.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.920
Later,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.310
I went

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.910
to Shanxi,
where the world's wealth gathered.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.110
There,

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.070
I saw

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.200
giant Buddha statues
and the Eighteen Arhats

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.400
made of pure gold.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.720
Their eyes

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.240
and clothes were

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.790
all inlaid with huge gems.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:48.920
Next,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.530
I returned to Jiangnan.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.270
That place was awash

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.530
with beautiful women.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.030
I even went to Beijing

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.540
and saw Empress Dowager Cixi.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.060
She drank our Orchid Snow tea.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.050
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.780
[Top Tea Under Heaven]

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.060
Go ahead and brag all you want.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.400
Aren't you afraid that you might
strain your tongue with all that hot air?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.240
I never brag.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:43.650
What about you?

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.400
How have you been these past two years?

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.640
Me?

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.310
Thanks to you,

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.680
I'm here managing this horse camp.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.490
There are 9 months
of winter here every year.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.360
I've been living like a rat,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.050
feeding on the meat of frozen dead horses.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.140
Judging from your condition,

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.240
I doubt you'll last much longer.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.270
Don't worry.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.030
I'll live long enough to see you die.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.240
Wait.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.900
Let's have a good talk.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.640
For all the suffering
you've endured these years,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.170
I can pay to compensate you.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.720
In this godforsaken place,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.000
even if you offer me
mountains of gold and silver,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.030
it would be useless to me.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.120
Let's go!

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.880
Let's go outside to cool off!

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.270
No.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.480
Stop!

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.750
Let's talk! Don't!

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.310
I'm not leaving!

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.010
I'm staying right here.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.640
No! Don't shoot me!

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.840
Move one more inch and see what happens!

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.790
Wait.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.510
This is a foreign gun.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.350
A breech-loading model, right?

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.010
This place is close to Russia.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.030
You bought it from the people

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.270
who came from there, right?

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.640
You talk too much.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.070
If you can trade with them,

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.750
why can't you do business with me?

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.770
If you stay and work here forever,

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.270
you'll never be
more than a battalion commander,

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.330
a nobody with an insignificant rank!

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.600
Have you ever considered

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.480
that you could be a guerrilla leader,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.480
or even a general?

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.170
I'll be the one who screws you!

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.070
Okay! Whatever!

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.730
But do you want to be a general?

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:17.970
Listen to me.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.750
The imperial court is now

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800
planning to reclaim the Northwest.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.430
They need to purchase
a large quantity of arms,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.170
exactly like the foreign gun
you're holding.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.320
If you've got a source for them,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.520
we can work together.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.770
Let's collaborate!

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.030
I traded

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.240
four wolf pelts for this gun.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.200
How many guns
would I need to become a general?

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.200
Several hundred.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.960
The more the better.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.040
I have money.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.170
I have plenty of it.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.160
Xu.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.550
Xu!

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.450
Let's talk again, shall we?

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:01.480
Please!

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.240
Please!

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.510
Xu!

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.920
Let go of me!

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720
Xu!

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.690
If you have the guts, just kill me!

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.590
Kill me!

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.350
Xu!

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.270
Xu!

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.160
Xu!

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.350
Please let me go.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:56.830
♪ This year sees
the most enchanting spring ♪

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.150
Is Ms. Su inside?

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:58.910
Hey,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.300
why won't you let me in?

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.960
What is she busy with?

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.920
There's an opera performance inside.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.770
She can't be busy!

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:04.770
Ms. Su!

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.880
Ms. Su!

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.680
I need to speak with you!

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.310
Ms. Su!

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.180
-You may leave.
-It's urgent!

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.400
Just let me in!

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.410
Stop making a scene. Let him in.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.180
Welcome, Young Master Li.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.230
What brings you here?

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.170
Where have you taken Gu Pingyuan?

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.480
I know who you are.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.790
Who am I?

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.790
You were humiliated in Pingyao.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.430
Isn't he your enemy?

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.510
Since when have you been
on good terms with him?

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.960
I also don't know why,

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.790
but I am worried about him.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.110
You should worry about yourself

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.160
and your father.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.310
Do you really think

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.640
being Li Wantang's son

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.320
means you're safe and sound?

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.750
This enormous wealth

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.200
and overwhelming power

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.030
can vanish overnight.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:29.880
Just tell me

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.210
where he is. That's all.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.490
You really want to know?

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:34.920
I...

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880
Don't answer yet.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.140
I'll ask you three questions.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.680
After that, if you still want to know,

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.540
I'll keep my promise and tell you.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:46.750
This man

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.050
ruined the big plan of your father and me.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.490
Do you really want to save him?

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.600
Yes, I do.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.640
Are you curious

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.500
about what kind of big plan it was?

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.320
Listen to me.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.320
If we collect a cart of guns,

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.570
we can sell them and make a fortune.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.840
You need to become an official.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.920
Otherwise, money is useless to you.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.480
We'll get

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.260
as much as you need.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.950
It's between just you and me.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.480
I was also there
at the Grand Tea Competition that day.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.050
I knew the Empress Dowager would come.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.710
I prepared a cup of poisoned tea for her,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.350
but Gu ruined it.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.480
Such an extremely rare opportunity was

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.740
just wasted like that.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.480
The chance of finding
another opportunity like this is

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.680
almost zero.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.550
If you save him,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.730
you'll be making an enemy of me.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.350
Now that you've heard what I've done,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.350
you share half the responsibility.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.310
If you save his life,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960
you'll be an accomplice.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.760
You can't stay out of it anymore.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.110
Usurpation leads to punishment
more than just beheading.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.930
The entire clan will be
sentenced to death by slicing.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.530
Do you still want to save him?

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.680
I must save him.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.140
You really don't get it.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.000
If that woman dies,

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.270
the Sixth Prince
can immediately become regent,

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.070
promoting commerce
and expanding diplomatic relations.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.960
When that happens,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.480
who do you think will oversee

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.880
all commercial affairs?

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:53.690
If you save him,

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.830
you'll get in the way
of your father's rising to power.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.580
Do you really want to save him?

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.610
These big issues you mentioned

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.240
don't concern me.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.160
All I know is

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.480
that he's my only friend.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.290
I must save him.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.310
If Gu Pingyuan dies,

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.040
everyone will have some peace.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.550
You're the only one who cares about him.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.680
This man

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.000
has got brains and tricks way better

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.880
than yours.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.480
He's no ordinary man for sure.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.400
Once he gets the upper hand,

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.860
you'll be no match for him.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.680
Do you want to keep an enemy for yourself?

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680
Do you want to let someone

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.400
who outdoes you

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.330
in every way survive in this world?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.760
Do you still want to save him?

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.880
Answer me.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.030
Mr. Li.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.890
Who's there?

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.980
You're Mr. Li Qin,

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.960
son of Li Million in Beijing, right?

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.290
We met in Shanxi before.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.030
I've been looking everywhere for Mr. Gu.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.290
Do you know where he is?

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.150
You've got the wrong person.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.040
You...

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.970
And you are?

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.240
I'm Chang Yu'er.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.280
My father is Mr. Chang Si.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:13.720
We came
from the Tea Merchants' Association

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.120
in Shanxi with our goods.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.200
I...

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:18.440
I want to see him.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.440
Can I trust you?

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.160
You know

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:26.510
how he risked his life

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.830
to save my father.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.120
I don't know where he is.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.800
Just tell me.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.100
What if he's already dead?

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.630
If he were dead,

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.590
he would have said goodbye to me.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.490
I haven't dreamed of that.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.360
Since you put it that way, I believe you.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.620
He's in a place of bitter cold.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.880
In the past few years,

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.070
these wolf cubs have bullied me a lot.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.240
Before I leave, I need to tell them

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.230
that I'm going to be a general.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.030
Do the Russians live

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.830
far from here?

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.840
Cross the Argun River

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.440
and head further north,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.370
and that's where

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.440
the Cossack cavalry is stationed.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.290
That's a trading area
between the two states.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.440
Grilled meat! Come take a look!

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440
Fresh meat!

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.510
Grilled meat! Check this out!

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.920
Fresh meat! Fresh meat for sale!

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.320
Grilled meat! Come take a look!

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.280
Great prices!

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.070
Come and take a look!

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.960
Come check out the fresh lamb!

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.840
Freshly butchered lamb legs! Take a look!

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.760
Here's some nice stuff!

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.280
The freshest meat! Come on!

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.590
It's cheap.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.550
This is called Shashlik.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.150
It's local grilled meat.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.360
Bigger piece! Bigger!

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:24.800
Here.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.920
Try it. Very delicious!

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.670
Thank you very much.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.060
Bigger piece! Bigger!

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.880
Handsome guy.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.800
Come on, let's dance.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.800
Look.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.440
Who's this guy from the Qing Empire?

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.330
Are we going to buy guns from them?

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.920
Excuse me.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.290
Excuse me. Let me through, please.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.030
What are you doing?

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.590
Sorry.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.480
Get lost.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.110
Get out of here.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.230
Shoot! They have a gun!

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.490
Don't let them escape!

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.670
After them! Let's go!

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.700
[Good Weather]

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.510
Why did you run around like that?

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.150
How would I know

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.210
what that place is?

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.710
Tie yourself to the horse!

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.070
We're hitting the road tonight!

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:23.920
Were it not for me,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.050
they would have eaten you alive by now.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.880
How can you still laugh
on the brink of death?

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.590
Karma finally caught up with you.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.850
Now you know how I felt.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.480
Get out.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.480
Are you Tartars?

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.850
The Qing Empire.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.410
We're from the Qing Empire!

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.660
I'm a merchant.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.440
I am

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.400
a merchant doing business.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.530
I have a lot of money!

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.900
Let me see what you've got.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.440
Boots!

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.150
In the b-boots.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.320
You cunning man.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.890
Do you have any?

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.030
I have boots.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.030
Guards!

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.020
Take this man away.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:54.320
Gu Pingyuan!

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.650
Gu Pingyuan!

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.660
Ask them not to kill me!

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.880
Tell them not to kill me!

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.800
No, no! We're together!

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.030
We're both merchants!

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.590
-Business partners!
-Partners!

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.510
Hold on.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.570
Bring him back.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.710
W-We are

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.240
business partners.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.800
Buy guns.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.820
We want to buy guns!

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.360
Buy guns!

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.230
Haven't you done business with him before?

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.430
How do you say "guns"?

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.400
Guns.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.360
Guns!

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.070
Did he get it?

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.440
How would I know?

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.510
I bought my gun

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.710
from another hunter.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.630
I've never dealt

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.760
with them directly.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.690
You've really screwed us over.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.630
They're going to make us

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.360
into Shashlik (grilled meat).

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.670
No!

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.700
No, no, no.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.500
No, no, no.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.190
No, no, no.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.110
No, no, no.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.240
It's not expensive.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.510
So he got it.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.920
The Governor of Anhui, Qiao Song, told me

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.670
that they bought guns

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:12.940
at 16 taels of silver each.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.630
We only need to pay
3 taels of silver for each.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.360
This is a real bargain.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.180
You're buying over 100 guns at once.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:20.880
How will you take them back?

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.760
We have money.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.320
We can buy a huge cart

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.880
and use horses to transport them back.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.070
Once we reach
the military station in Ningguta,

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.070
everything will be easy.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:28.800
I have the permit issued

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.800
by the imperial court to purchase guns.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.590
As long as you're telling

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:33.670
the truth about the imperial court's plan
to buy guns.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:34.300
Come on,

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.550
just rest assured.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.320
You got it this time.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.630
You can gain an official position

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.760
and make money, too.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.400
Nobility for generations

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.730
and wealth till old age.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.400
Let's call it even between us.
