00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720
That's enough, don't shout.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.960
Does it hurt so much

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.130
for such a small wound?

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.270
How can it not hurt?

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.630
I'm going to die.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.200
It's not his fault.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.270
I gave him medicine to enhance his five senses.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.430
Fu Sheng, you're awake.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.910
Is this what you call unstable?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.480
This elevates the five senses,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.150
so the pain will be elevated as well.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.720
So when will the effect be gone?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.390
I don't know.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.310
It's my first time using it too.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.030
I seem to owe you in my past life.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.120
If I had known,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.430
I would have stayed in Shangyi and been executed.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.150
I'm sorry.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.840
Fu Sheng.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.360
I suffered this for you,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.720
so think about how to compensate me.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.880
Then

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.350
let's write it down.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.650
You...

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.310
Enough. Stop this show.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:22.960
Do you know

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.080
how dangerous it was yesterday?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.390
If I hadn't gotten there in time,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.000
you two would have been buried today.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.960
What about

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.120
Master Lin and Sun Siming?

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.960
Sun Siming is still alive,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.380
but

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.640
Master Lin is dead.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.600
Who killed him?

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.920
I don't know.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.310
I was afraid that the Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.480
would take revenge on you,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.960
so I didn't care about anything else.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.150
I asked Jiu

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.880
to bring you back.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.790
I really don't know

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.850
what happened after that,

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.510
but

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.120
Lin's Mansion was set on fire

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120
by the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.200
On fire?

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.720
Did you see a woman

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.550
in black?

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.030
Were there other women with you?

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.270
Who was she?

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.910
I'd like to know who she was too.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.510
OK.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.430
By the way, this is the third time

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.760
I've saved you.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:17.790
Tell me.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.200
How do you plan to repay me?

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.670
I wanted to thank you for saving my life,

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.200
but I thought I couldn't repay you with thanks,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.880
so I promised to work for you

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.390
forever in my next life.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.670
Don't say these meaningless ones.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.350
I don't care about your labor.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.430
Wen Jue.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.650
No matter what,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.190
I really don't know how to repay

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.960
being saved by you so many times,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.150
so I only have to do my best

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.120
to save Lord Wen

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.720
in order to live up to your saving grace these three times.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.670
That's what you said.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.390
If you can cure my father,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.600
the favor of saving your life

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.480
will be written off.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.240
I'll open a medical center for you

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.430
in Xichuan, okay?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.000
That would be great.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.880
That would be great.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.360
But I need to warn you

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.670
that if you can't cure him,

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.760
you two will pay back everything

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.310
I've given you.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.310
Why is it that if he can cure your father,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.390
you're only giving him a clinic

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.030
while asking us both to pay back if he can't?

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.030
I don't care.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.630
I must have my share in the clinic.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.310
Young Mistress.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.910
The city lord wants to see you.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.790
Jiu,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.910
can't you see

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.150
I have a patient here?

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:32.910
My leg.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.050
- My leg hurts. - I'll bandage it.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.000
I'll bandage it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.480
Come on.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.120
Be careful.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.240
- I'm hurt bad this time. - Look.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.120
I'm sure that their condition

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.080
is not bothering you.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.720
Jiu, you're right.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.600
My father must want to see me

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.270
because he has something big to discuss.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.270
I can't keep my dad waiting.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.550
So,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.480
you guys,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.160
take care of it yourself.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.310
Such a big Xichuan

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.950
cannot do anything without me.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:04.800
Jiu.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.830
Can you not embarrass me

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.520
in front of my friends?

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.160
My nephew.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.400
Have you come today

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.370
with many possessions

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.160
because you have something to say to me?

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.310
Lord Wen.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.430
I'm a rough man who doesn't know how to talk.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.590
I have come today

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.950
to offer a bride price.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.920
I have admired Young Mistress for a long time,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.350
so please

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.400
fulfill us.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.640
Okay.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:40.850
Okay.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.280
What is OK?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.470
Come on.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.950
Young Mistress.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.550
Take your things and disappear.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.640
I don't want to see you.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.240
Don't take it personally.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.550
Jue.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.280
Young Mistress.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.550
If you don't like these,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.470
what do you like?

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.760
I'll get them for you at once.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.670
I like you to stay away from me.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:00.710
Listen.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.950
If you ever come to propose again,

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.800
I'll ask Jiu to throw you out.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.000
Don't take it personally.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.960
Lord Wen.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.720
Sooner or later, we'll all be family.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.830
Goodbye.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.910
Who's your family?

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.350
Jue.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.200
Be well.

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.150
Jue.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.550
Dad.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.350
[Firm as a Rock]

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.520
You sold me out

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.550
for these things?

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.240
You are the most precious thing I have.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.240
How can these things

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.440
compare to you?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.310
So you're just tired of me

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.680
and want to get rid of me?

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.800
I'm not.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:31.900
Jue.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.790
You have to realize

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.310
that I'm doing this

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.590
so that you can have a firm foothold

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.920
in Xichuan in the future.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.830
Can I, the Young Mistress of Xichuan,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.830
be messed with by any fool?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I know.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.000
You just love Xubu Huai

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.150
and want him to be your son.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.910
I don't.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.070
I have to tell you.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.870
I'll die before I marry him.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.910
Jue.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.550
Jue.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.520
Jue.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.800
Dad.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.070
- Sir. - Dad.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.520
Sir.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.440
Come on.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.150
Fu Sheng.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.800
How is my father doing?

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.760
Wasn't he cured last time?

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.720
Why did he faint?

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.510
Lord Wen is nothing serious.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.110
Just heatstroke.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.040
- Heatstroke? - I'll give him some medicine

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.990
to relieve heatstroke,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.720
and he'll be fine.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.960
Jue.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.200
Physician Fu is here, don't worry,

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.120
but I woke up

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.000
feeling hungry.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.040
Go see if there's

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.680
any lotus seed congee in the kitchen.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.310
Okay.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.420
I'll be right there.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.700
Fu Sheng.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.720
Come out for a moment.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.590
I want to talk to you.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:12.980
Fu Sheng.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:14.950
Do you know

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.070
why my father suddenly fainted?

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:26.960
I lost my mother when I was young.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.680
My father brought me up.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.530
My father

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.160
is my only family in this world.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.500
He's like

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.160
my living faith.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.740
You probably understand

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.830
that feeling, right?

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.930
Ever since my father got sick,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.220
he's been hell-bent on me marrying Xubu Huai,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.670
worried that I, a woman,

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.000
would be swallowed up by those two gangs

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.560
if anything happened to him.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:00.760
It was as if

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.350
he was handing over his most beloved treasure

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.260
to another who seemed

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.330
to be able to protect it,

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.470
so he tried to keep me away.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.260
Lord Wen

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.590
is a good father.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.080
He is always protecting me,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.910
so I want to save him.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.350
Fu Sheng.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.280
If you can save my father,

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.760
I can give you great wealth or help you

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.590
find the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.760
I can give you anything.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.240
I just want him to live.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.910
But

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.830
I'm not sure now.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.790
Wen Jue.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.640
Today, I kneel down and beg you

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.750
to save my father.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.550
I am only what I am

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640
if he is alive.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.790
If he dies,

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.900
I will have no one else

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.510
in the world to hold on to.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.390
Fu Sheng.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.550
Please.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.000
Do what you can

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.400
to save him.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.720
Get up.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:35.500
Come on.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.920
Get up.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.000
I would have done everything

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.640
even if you hadn't said so.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.640
Siming.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.640
Nice work.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.400
Monkey.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.200
You're a great benefactor to me.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.270
Siming.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.230
Why are you saluting this monkey?

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.470
Li Zhizhuo tried to kill me again.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.300
Thanks to Young Mistress arriving in time

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.070
and saving my life.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.900
Didn't you say

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.000
he wouldn't kill you again?

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.750
Then if he wants to kill you,

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.230
he can do this at any time.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.080
We'd better go.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.560
Go?

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.510
It's an opportunity.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.470
Opportunity?

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.120
How did he die?

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.200
This traitor thought

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.600
he could rest easy

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.750
in the haunted mansion,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.470
but one of my carriage stewards

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.270
found him

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.120
and killed him

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.510
on the spot.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.500
This man's name was Sun Siming,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.400
and he was a man with a quick mind.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.120
My lord has ordered you

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.310
to purchase for him the blades

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.560
to be auctioned at the Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.240
But if the Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.040
calls for so much

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.960
to participate in the Golden Bloom Banquet,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.310
will it arouse

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.040
the suspicion of other forces?

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.070
This is your business.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.590
Figure it out yourself.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.760
Your head will leave your body

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.630
if you screw this up.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.280
Get out of here.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:16.590
I want to be alone for a while.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.910
Senior.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.390
I've lost the last of my family.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.680
Hurry up.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.350
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.350
If you can't cure city lord,

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.200
Wen Jiu will kill us.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:16.200
How about this?

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.310
Now write a prescription.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:19.440
It's the kind of prescription

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.680
that will cure city lord.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.280
Then tell Wen Jue we're going out of town

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.910
[Aloofness]
to pick up some medicine.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.630
Wen Jiu will certainly not stop us.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.960
Once we leave the city gates,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.030
we'll ditch Wen Jue and run,

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.590
and never return to this hellhole.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:32.520
No.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.550
I've promised Wen Jue

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.390
I'd save her father.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.520
Why are you so stubborn?

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.680
Why do you still care

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.960
about promises at this point?

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.040
A man's got to keep his word.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.350
Besides, if Wen Yu dies,

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.070
Wen Jue will be an orphan, right?

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:47.550
Aren't you afraid

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.870
that if she becomes an orphan,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.720
we'll both become ghosts?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.240
Gu Tian.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.070
You have two younger brothers.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.830
You'd better not get caught up

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.110
in this trouble.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.150
How about this?

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.480
I'll tell Wen Jiu

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.960
that you can't help much with the cure,

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.390
but you have to go back home

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.760
because of a family matter.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.350
You've arranged it plainly,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.240
but I also have my creed.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:21.520
I never

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.760
owe anyone.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:23.960
Well,

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.350
I'll help you one last time

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.680
before I go.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.150
Is there anything else you want to do?

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.960
You really can't help

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.270
with the treatment,

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.530
so just look up

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.560
tussah silk for me.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.630
Okay,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.760
but I'm afraid

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.040
it involves Breakwall.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.110
It's too dangerous.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.150
That counts as two favors.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.800
In that case,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.800
you owe me one.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.040
Give me a portion of the Treasure of the Sealed Book

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.800
when you find it.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.870
And if I die?

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.280
Simple.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.280
I get your

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:05.480
Bird Jade Plate.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.000
All right.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:11.720
So

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.910
don't die.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.480
[Chunyun House]

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.720
Regarding the tussah silk,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.910
I need to trouble you.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.280
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.870
I'll go to Feng Qianli.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.480
Still one day?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.390
Yes.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.800
Mr. Gu, you're so powerful.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.550
You've come to order my brother around.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.760
[Graceful and Attractive]

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.720
I didn't want to bother you today.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.910
But you came to my house anyway.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.070
I'm leaving.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.000
I didn't want to be in such a hurry,

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.680
but since I came to Xichuan,

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.280
everything has gone wrong.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.280
Not only have I made no money,

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.870
but also I've gotten into trouble.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:14.350
If I don't leave,

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:15.550
I'm afraid I...

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.910
You can leave if you want to.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.440
No need for words.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.610
I didn't understand

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.550
why I wanted to come

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.520
into your room today.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.650
It was only when I got to the door

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.070
that I realized

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.760
I couldn't leave

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.200
without seeing you.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.830
Now you've seen me.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.740
So

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.240
I am reluctant even more.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.000
Get lost.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.680
Yes, ma'am.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.680
After thinking about it,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.480
I think what happened at Lin's Mansion

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.720
is a big conspiracy.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.200
Li Zhizhuo tried

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.110
to burn Lin's Mansion many times.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.870
Why does he keep holding on

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.680
to Lin's Mansion?

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.640
He wants to force Master Lin to show up.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.150
But Master Lin

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.440
is a traitor to Breakwall,

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.040
so is Li Zhizhuo also a member of Breakwall?

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:05.960
In that case,

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.040
Song Jingye and your father's deaths

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.830
were the work of Breakwall

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.680
in order to find the Bird Jade Plate

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.680
and the Cloud-shaped Jade?

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.310
But they didn't realize

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.280
that Master Lin gave us

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.150
the Cloud-shaped Jade to protect himself

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.280
or that the Bird Jade Plate

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.830
they wanted so badly

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.390
was right in front of their eyes,

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.070
but no one found it.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.760
It was all just luck.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.630
The woman who appeared

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.310
in Lin's Mansion didn't kill us.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:39.960
But since she appeared in Lin's Mansion,

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.200
she should have something

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.310
to do with Breakwall.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.200
Moreover,

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.390
I found

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.440
a horseshoe-shaped mark

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.240
on her neck before I fainted.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.110
If we find this person,

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.870
we will interrogate where the Sealed Book is located.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.240
At that time,

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.150
will we be able to open

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.760
the Treasure of the Sealed Book?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.590
Will the treasure

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.150
be countless?

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.130
Yes, it will.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.870
I heard you were having trouble with your eyes.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:21.040
How do you feel now?

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:22.720
Mr. Chairman.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.550
What brings you here?

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.350
They're good horses,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.440
but

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.880
will they be still so good

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.200
if another owner keeps them?

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.070
Mr. Chairman.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.870
Have I done something

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.150
to displease you?

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.280
We're all brothers,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.590
so why do you make such a fuss?

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.280
How dare I be a brother

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.040
to Mr. Chairman?

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.830
I wouldn't dare.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.000
What's wrong with that?

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:51.910
Didn't you hurt your eye

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.150
for the Jibei Chamber of Commerce?

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.720
How did Lin hurt you

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.620
so badly?

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.960
So did he

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.240
press you for something

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.440
or did he

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.680
want you to do something for him?

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.070
The old man was arrogant.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.680
He despised me

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.040
through and through.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.520
My injuries didn't come out of Lin's Mansion.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.760
They came out of nowhere.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.520
My brother said I was possessed

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.240
and suggested I see a witch doctor.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.630
Is that true?

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.000
Don't lie to me.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.240
I have good intentions.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.070
If I tell you a lie,

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.390
I'll go blind in this eye.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:37.870
Good.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.070
You have been smart

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.720
and done a great job for me,

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.910
so I'll give you a great gift.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.680
Be sure to accept it.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.510
What does Mr. Chairman want to give me?

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.440
Siming.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.680
A beautiful woman is in your room.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.910
Come on.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.630
You have been smart

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.720
and done a great job for me,

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.550
so I'll give you a great gift.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.440
My brother.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.520
Come here.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.080
Do you want a wife?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.900
Yes, I do.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:54.960
Of course.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.240
Even in my dreams.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280
The woman there

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.680
is the wife I give you.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.760
Really?

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:06.240
So...

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.390
Go.

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.680
Darling.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.800
Who are you?

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:23.900
- You're my wife. - Stay away.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.160
Stay away.

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:26.390
A perfect match.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:29.200
Nice.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.870
Everyone's looking for the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.120
If it were me...

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.590
Where did you get it?

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.590
Master Lin gave it to me before he died.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.440
Ever since I took it,

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.590
I've kept it in plain sight

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.630
just so you could listen to me

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.040
when you came.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:41.520
What do you want to say?

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.360
He died with a grievance,

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.000
so he had something to say.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.360
With a grievance?

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.010
You didn't kill him?

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.110
He was a good fighter.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.440
I, as a non-fighter,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.190
couldn't even get close to him.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.470
You still don't believe

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.320
what I say,

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.640
but before he died,

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.280
he told me

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.640
he had something else

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.910
that would make you believe me.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.240
Before he died,

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.120
he asked me to tell you

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.470
to go as far away as possible

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.560
from Li Zhizhuo.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.800
He is no longer

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.720
with the organization.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:48.390
If you get too close to him,

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.390
he will hurt you.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.680
Why should I believe you?

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.720
Li Zhizhuo said you killed him.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.910
If you asked him, he must have said so.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.600
If you give me time,

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.950
I'll prove it to you.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.080
OK.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:06.480
I believe you this time.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.480
Take it.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:11.230
With it, you can find me anytime.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.190
Yes, ma'am.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.790
Siming.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.040
Siming.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.500
It's probably a venom attack.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:08.870
What should I do?

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:09.640
What should I do?

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.030
I'll go to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.280
Fu Sheng.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.200
Go to Fu Sheng.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.760
Okay, Fu Sheng.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.680
Let's go.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.200
Be careful.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.720
Serious illnesses need strong medicine.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.390
If he wants to cure Wen Yu,

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.470
he must use a powerful medicine

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.800
to tonify him.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.560
When he becomes energetic,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.950
he'll definitely not get sick.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.830
That will kill him.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.800
Treatise on Febrile Diseases mentions

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.560
that those who have retch,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.600
salivation,

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.720
and headaches

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.800
should mainly drink fructus evodiae.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.240
He has had a lot of soup like that.

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:56.510
I think he should

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.950
soak ginseng in water

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.560
and then have the city lord drink a bowl of that every two hours.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.040
Nonsense.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.280
What are you thinking?

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.600
I'm wondering

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.120
if you guys fight

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.990
when I'm not around.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.160
Oh, no.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.830
Crazy Fu is so crazy.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:16.990
We're a figment of your imagination.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.870
This house doesn't exist without you,

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:19.830
and neither do we.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.870
How could we fight?

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.720
You'd better figure out how to save Wen Yu.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.390
Annoying.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.760
My brother.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.830
Why did you push him?

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.560
If he falls and gets hurt,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.310
who will treat me?

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.350
Help him up.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.430
Why did you push me?

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.080
Save him.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:39.720
Physician Fu.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.180
My arm is in pain.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.600
Please check it for me.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.390
Is the snake venom acting up again?

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.760
There's no swelling or ecchymosis.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.470
Move your arms and legs.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.930
Your limbs also move normally.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.470
Stick out your tongue.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.030
No poisoning

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.800
on your tongue or eyelids.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.950
Have you had any dizziness lately?

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:09.830
No.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.160
Then this is not snake venom.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.600
But I can't lift my arm.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.560
Come here.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.280
I'll take your pulse.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.640
Your Excellency.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.280
Please take the medicine.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.640
No.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:36.730
What are you doing?

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.600
Get up.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.510
I'll drink it.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:10.410
Get up.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.160
Let him in.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:15.910
Yes, sir.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.640
Come in.
