00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,560
They started using this because of you.

169
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,040
Because you stabbed him in the chest.

170
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,440
And he ended up being transferred
to a patrol station.

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,680
I heard from him recently. He said
the patrol station was a perfect fit.

172
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
Really?

173
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,880
He even sent me a gift card.

174
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,080
What about me?

175
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,400
Why didn't he send me one?

176
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,600
He must have had his reasons.

177
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,320
I'm starving.

178
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,720
Let's go eat.

179
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,600
(Motel)

180
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
Front desk.

181
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,600
I hear it too.

182
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,520
The second floor?

183
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,760
Okay, I'll tell them.

184
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,520
What are they doing
in the middle of the day?

185
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,040
Sir.

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,960
If you break anything,
you'll have to pay for it.

187
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,360
Do you want to get beat up?

188
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,480
(The days are getting slightly warm,)

189
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,840
(but the fact that we can breathe
without wearing masks)

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,480
(makes it a happy day.)

191
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,800
(Although the world has changed
since before the Covid-19 pandemic,)

192
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,400
(we've learned to appreciate
average days.)

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,240
(I hope)

194
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,160
(you all have a happy afternoon)

195
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,280
(during which you can see
each other's faces and smiles)

196
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,760
(and look up at the blue sky
and take deep breaths.)

197
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,520
(Enjoy the rest of your day.)

198
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,760
(I'll be back tomorrow...)

199
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,680
(We never know
when there will be another epidemic.)

202
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,040
(Jung Yi-hyun)
Here.

203
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,120
Here.

204
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,720
Do you still want to play baseball
with your bum knee?

205
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
They pay me if you play as a ringer.

206
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,040
-What's the case?
-A murder.

207
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,320
You didn't even know that?

208
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,720
I came because I was told to.

209
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,480
I even gave up my day off
and a baseball game.

210
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
-You should be grateful.
-Ever so grateful.

211
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,760
-Here.
-Babe.

212
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,960
The next room reported it.

213
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,160
-When we came out...
-Excuse me.

214
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,280
-Who's the victim?
-The clerk.

215
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,120
Let's go.

216
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,400
-And then...
-What is going on here?

217
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,640
What did he do to his neck?

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,840
I don't know.

219
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,080
It looks like it was a blunt knife.

220
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,080
Maybe to make it hurt?

221
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,600
Who's the suspect?

222
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,960
The one staying in this room.

223
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,280
People complained like crazy
because he was so loud.

224
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,320
Who covered him up?

225
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,040
Did you cover him up?

226
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
No, sir. That was how we found him.

227
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,640
-Any witnesses?
-Not yet.

228
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,520
They found him like this.

229
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,120
Did they check the security videos?

230
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,520
The security...

231
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,640
Why you...

232
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
What about the security videos?

233
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,280
They're checking them now,

234
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,720
but they don't have any footage
of the suspect leaving.

235
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,280
He covered the dead
before fleeing the scene.

236
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,240
But he wasn't caught leaving on camera.

237
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,200
He must've filled out an entry form.

238
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,360
But we won't get access, I'm sure.

239
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,440
Since it's a violation of privacy laws.

240
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,520
Murderers don't have rights.

241
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,840
We should round them all up
and send them to prison.

242
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,640
I just don't get it.

243
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,880
Not you.

244
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,240
What?

245
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,640
I assume they didn't look in here.

(Jung Yi-hyun)

247
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Hey, I know you're the type to drill
into the investigation with pure luck--

248
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
I'm not.

249
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,480

Come out.

252
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Are you joking around?

253
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,120
You're dead meat if you are.

254
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Darn it.

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
I looked him in the eyes.

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,520
Hey, we caught the criminal.
So don't come in.

257

259

Did you do it, Mr. Sung Woo-je?

260
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
I don't know.

261
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,440
Did you cover the body
because you were scared to look at it?

262
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,920
But why did you kill him?

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,840
You can't remember that either?

264
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,080
I think I had a dream.

265
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,080
Was that dream about killing him?

266
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,600
Covered in blood like this,
you weren't able to run away anywhere.

267
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,040
And the police barged in
when you weren't in your right mind.

268
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,640
So that's probably why you hid.

269
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,480
But where's the weapon?

270
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,160
How did you kill him in your dream?

271
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,110
You're right.

272
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,110
The court won't accept it
if we don't have the weapon.

273
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Well...

274
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,480
I was strangely thirsty.

275
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,200

You know where
the National Police Agency used to be?

287
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,120
It's currently under development.

Seniority, number of dependents,

and marital status are all scored,

but arrest records and performance scores
take up the highest proportion.

296

You're in charge of trainees

The culprit bought some drug
from an SOU trainee.

I heard it's a completely legal drug.

That just means you'll never get caught.

Do you have any drugs left?

317

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,160
so guard my food.

333
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,720
It's more important than food?

334
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,880
(Follow the code of conduct
to prevent re-spreading!)

335
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,800
That's so not like her.

336
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
Don't worry. I warned everyone

337
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,560
not to eat your pork cutlet.

338
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,600
What are they doing?

339
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,160
Don't tell me they're having sex here.

340
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
Those punks.

341
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,120
Trainee Lee Jong-tae?

342
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,760
Trainee Lee Jong-tae!

343
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,880
Save me!

344
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
What's wrong with him?

345
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
Stop right there, Lee Jong-tae.

346
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,920
Seung-young, take him outside!

347
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,480
It's your pelvis next.

How would I know?

350
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,880
I'll stay here, so go get him some help.

351
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Come on.

352
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Emergency! Is there no one here?

353
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,000
This is a real situation!

354

Ma'am.

358
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,160
Ma'am...

359
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Get me the shelf.

360
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,200

-You should've told me he's dangerous!

364
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,840
I almost died

365
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,200
I almost died!

366
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,680
What do you mean? Why would you die?

367
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,600
How is he fine after being shot?

368
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,040
Who shot who? Are you okay?

369
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,320
Of course, I'm fine.

370
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,280
How did you catch someone like that
without a gun?

371
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,160
I persuaded him.

372
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,720
Was that even possible?
Were you able to communicate with him?

373
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Tell me in detail what happened.

374
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,960
Did you meet Lee Jong-tae?

375
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
(I did.)

376
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,280
Did he try to bite you?

377
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,440
You know very well.

378
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640

There's a chance
he has an infectious disease.

390

what's going on?

Senior Officer Yoon

415
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,960
needs to be tested as she had contact
with an infected trainee.

416
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,520
But she's okay now, right?

417
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,720
She's already been vaccinated
since she's an essential worker.

(He bit a man's neck.)

425
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,960
Is that related to the infection?

I'll meet you there.

So you're saying

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,840
this disease makes people bite others
once they're infected?

as if airborne transmission wasn't enough?

have that pill?

461

No. Maybe it's not an infectious disease.

462

Don't you think
it's a side effect of a hallucinogen?

Hey, Il-ho.

498
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,920
Hey! Why didn't you play today?

499
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,960
Come with me.

500
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,040
Hey, either call me
or at least pick up when I call.

501
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,280
What was I supposed to do?

502
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,960
Okay, I heard you.

503
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,840
Anyway,

504
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,190
take a look.

505
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,710
What's that?

506
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,800
Some kind of drug.
But I don't know what it is.

507
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,520
Why are you giving me a drug?

508
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,960
Don't get the wrong idea.
Hear me out first, okay?

509
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,320
You got kicked out for using drugs.

510
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,920
I thought it was an herbal tonic...

511
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
Seriously. And you call yourself a friend.

512
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,400
That's not true.
You did it to play baseball better.

513
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,440
I wanted to play well too,
but it didn't work out.

514
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,560
Don't bring that up. It's all in the past.

515
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,840
Yes, in the past.

516
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,150
You got your act together
and studied hard afterward.

517
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,630

518
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,560
This is important, that's why.

519
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,360
This isn't a drug.

520
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
Why not?

521
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,760
See that serial number?

522

Who puts in that much effort for a drug?

523

-Look it up for me.
-Me? When do you need it by?

527
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Right now.

528
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,960
Wake me when you find it.

What is this place?

532
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,640
It's not a hospital.
It looks like a school.

533
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,200
We can't let an infected man

534
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,840
who may bite people's necks
loose in a crowded place.

535
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,360
Will I end up like Lee Jong-tae?

536
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,800
Just kidding.

537
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,960
I won't bite you.

538
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,960
-You'll get hurt.
-Exactly.

539
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,480
Give me some answers.

540
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,960
I thought you were putting ointment on it.

541
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,760
What should I do until we get the results?

542
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Give your statement.

543
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,600
Tell me what happened today.

544
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,600
I saw Lee Jong-tae
attacking a fellow trainee,

545
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,040
so I tried to stop him.

546
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,920
How did Lee Jong-tae appear?

547
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,280
He looked very bad.

548
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,560
A little more specifically.

549
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,600
Both of his eyes looked white and cloudy

550
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,120
like he had cataracts in both eyes.

551
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,520
He tried to maul me
as if he were an animal.

552
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
I shot him twice,

553
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,480
but he didn't seem to feel pain.

554
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Is this

555
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,520
something like rabies?

556
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
It's similar.

557
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,000
My detective friend said
he was probably high.

558
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,040
If someone goes insane
and mauls another person,

559
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,200
the police will believe
it is drug-induced.

560
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,120
Because that is the easiest answer.

561
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,800
And it's easier for you
if it's an infectious disease.

562
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,960
People see what they believe.

563
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
However,

564
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,320
aren't you a cop too?

565
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,560
Well... We specialize
in terrorist attacks.

566
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,600
The police agency pays our salaries,
that's all.

567
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,160
Is Lee Jong-tae

568
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,840
all right?

569
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,120
He's recovering miraculously.

570
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,240
I'll find you a place to rest
while we wait for the test results.

571
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,160
Wait. May I get my phone back?

572
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,040

into one unit?

I'm so cold.

582
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,320
Do they not care about
the electricity bill?

583
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
How do you feel? Did you get tested?

584

(Yes. Everything but a colonoscopy.)

585
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,600

586

They say to stay here
until the results are out.

to reach you because of training.)

594
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,400
Anyway, where are you?

595
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,080
No clue. It looks like a college dorm.

596
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,920
I'm sure they won't kill me.

597

for our suspect.

He's clean.

601

Really?

602
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,320
Is it really an infectious disease?

603
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,160
I think it was drugs.

604

606
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Just something.

607

Anyway, I'll catch the perp

so that you can sleep at night.

00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,240
Okay. I'll be waiting.

659
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,600
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom. Come outside.

660
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,800
Lieutenant, when did you...

661
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,040
Are the test results out?

662
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,440
We're going to test you again.

663
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,120
Lieutenant.

664
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,560
Tell me before you remove
a piece of my skin today.

665
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,560
Or I'm really going to feel hurt.

666
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,680
Are there other patients here?

667
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,320
Lee Jong-tae?

668
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,920
Let me talk to him for a second.

669
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,120
You can't.

670
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,760
Ms. Yoon!

671
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,800
Ms. Yoon!

672
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,960
It won't take long.

673
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,840
Are you okay?

674
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,840
It's a bit cold,

675
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,840
but I'm fine.

676
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,240
Do you remember getting shot by me?

677
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,880
Yes.

678
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,880
What about biting the other trainee
and attacking me?

679
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,480
I'm not sure.

680
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,920
So you do.

681
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,840
Ms. Yoon, back away.

682
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,000
He might be dangerous.

683
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,560
It's all right.

684
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,080
He looks fine.

685
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,640
Did you go crazy after taking some drugs?

686
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,800
Where did you get them?

687
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

688
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,400
The guy you gave the drugs to
has already been arrested.

689
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,800
You know you'll be additionally punished
because you're a police officer, right?

690
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,720
See this?

691
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,520
You did this to me, Jong-tae.

692
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,360
They say it's an infectious disease here,
but I'm not entirely sure.

693
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,360
I need to know

694
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,200
whether this is a disease

695
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,600
or if it's because of the drug,

696
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,400
Jong-tae.

697
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,520
That way, I can get tested at ease.

698
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,680
Can't I drink some water?

699
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,880
He absolutely can't!

700
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,480
I'm so thirsty.

701
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,120
She says you can't.

702
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,760
I'm thirsty.

703
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,480
Hey, what are you doing?

704
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,800
Open your eyes. We're talking.

705
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,640
Hey.

706
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,520
Lee Jong-tae.

707
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,640
Give it your best today.

708
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,280
Come on!

709
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,240
Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok,

710
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,320
you're there, aren't you?

711
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,640
(No development plans for
Wonjung University's specialized street.)

712
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,960
(Residents, do not be deceived.)

713
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,760
(You're approaching your destination.)

714
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,320
(Opposing redevelopment and reconstruction
without alternatives)

715
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,000
(You've arrived at your destination.)

716
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,200
(Stop)
(You've arrived at your destination.)

717
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,280
(Stop)

718
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,080
(Stop)
(Route guide will end.)

719
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,640
(Stop)

720
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,360
What brings you here?

721
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,520
Isn't this Wonjung University?

722
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,080
It was shut down due to insufficiency.

723
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,880
The military is currently using it.

724
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,360
(Jung Yi-hyun)

725
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,480
(Jung Yi-hyun)
I'm with the police.

726
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:32,560
(Jung Yi-hyun)

727
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,080
(Jung Yi-hyun)
May I meet the person in charge?

728
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,160
(Jung Yi-hyun)

729
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,240
I'm afraid you can't.
This is a military classified area.

730
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,720
Then,

731
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,200
pass along a message
to Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok

732
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
that I brought the drug
I mentioned before.

733
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,800
Let him in.

734
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,440
You made me meet Lee Jong-tae on purpose,
didn't you?

735
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,360
You even installed surveillance cameras.

736
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,960
I wanted to know when he'd feel thirsty.

737
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,360
Thirsty?

738
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,200
When infected,
people lose reason and bite others.

739
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,800
They feel severe thirst,

740
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,960
but water can't quench it.

741
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,800
Even if they return to normal,
they keep feeling thirsty

742
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,040
and lose reason again.

743
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,680
We're looking into the conditions
when they feel thirsty.

744
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,280
I was curious

745
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,800
what Lee Jong-tae would be like
once he saw you.

746
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,880
So you wanted to know what he'd be like
once he saw the person who shot him?

747
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,000
He recognizes his family,

748
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,360
but I was wondering about others.

749
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,160
That wasn't the only thing.

750
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,040
His heart was beating slowly,

751
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,920
he seemed to feel less pain,

752
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,240
and his wounds healed quickly.

753
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,200
It'll make a lot of money
if it can be controlled.

754
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,120
Is that why
you're investigating it in secret?

755
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,240
Though it's not highly contagious,
it will scare people.

756
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,800
The degree of fatigue concerning
infectious diseases is already high.

757
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,120
There's no reason to make a fuss.

758
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,520
But why do you have
the air conditioner on?

759
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,440
The outbreak of the disease slows down
under low temperatures.

760
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,960
Is this also a test?

761
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,120
To see if I'm thirsty or not.

762
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,600
The test result showed
you're totally fine.

763
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,200
But I'm not such a lucky person.

764
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,200
Get some rest for the time being.

765
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,120
You mean, here?

766
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,640
No. Wherever you'd like.

767
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,120
Are you sure? Is that allowed?

768
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,240
It can be done if we say

769
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,560
you were hurt physically and mentally
while serving our country.

770
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,800
And we'll have to draw your blood
every two weeks.

771
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,200
You're not exhibiting any symptoms yet,

772
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,280
so you may already have antibodies.

773
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,840
(Temporary Pass)

774
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,720
(Important)

775
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,000
I guess I'm kind of important.

776
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,200
Do me one more favor.

777
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,840
You said earlier
that I served my country well.

778
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,600
Then I want the highest score
on my performance review for this year.

779
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
Sorry?

780
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,240
The public rental apartment in Seyang.

781
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,840
They reserve a few units for the police.

782
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,400
But it's a point system.

783
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,160
Marital status, number of dependents,

784
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,000
seniority, and performance review scores.

785
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,080
They add it all up.

786
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,960
I suppose you have that much influence.
Am I wrong?

787
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,080
I think I could arrange that.

788
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,440
You've been managing
a pretty good record anyway.

789
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,200
I'm the best.

790
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,320
I was born to prevent
and fight terrorist attacks.

791
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,120
I'm glad we're on the same page.

792
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,680
We don't shake hands anymore.

793
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,960
No, my phone.

794
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,240
Do you not serve breakfast here?
That's so petty.

795
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,960
Thank you. I'll go home and savor this.

796
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,800
Do you have a boyfriend?

797
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,000
I don't dislike you,

798
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,560
but the age gap is too big.

799
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,120
The highest performance evaluation score
won't be enough.

800
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,640
You'll need more points.

801
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,280
Do you have plans to get married soon?

802
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,480
Plans? I'll start planning now.

803
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,080
Are you not worried?

804
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,280
I'll get one of the apartment units,
no matter what.

805
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,320
So you don't need to worry about that.

806
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,840
I'm talking about what you saw
yesterday and today.

807
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
If things go wrong,

808
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,760
the world we knew up until yesterday
could collapse.

809
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,920
Will something change if I worry?

810
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,120
The world might not collapse after all.

811
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
Ma'am.

812
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,640
Where are my clothes?

813
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,840
We burned them.

814
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,080
I see.

815
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,880
Then do I have to go home like this?

816
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,840
Sae-bom! Hey.

817
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,760
Are you all right? Let me see.

818
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,400
You still don't trust me.

819
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,360
My feelings are actually hurt.

820
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm fine. I can go home.

821
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,840
I'm sorry for getting you into this.

822
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,960
Your face looks gaunt.

823
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,440
Really?
It's because I didn't have any breakfast.

824
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,640
By the way, how did you get in here?

825
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,880
Did they bring you in?
Were you bitten too?

826
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,520
No, I came to save you.

827
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,920
Wait here.
I have to go talk to someone quickly.

828
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,520
Impressive.

829
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,640
Looks like you could play baseball again.

830
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Is this

831
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,640
that pill?

832
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,800
That's right.
Apparently, it's a failed pneumonia cure.

833
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,160
Tons of people have taken it,

834
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,480
so it couldn't have caused the madness.

835
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,120
But I promised I'd find it,
so there you go.

836
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,200
Just because it was fine yesterday,

837
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,160
it doesn't mean it'll still be fine today.

838
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,540
I'll be off, then.

839
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,700
Let's go. I'll take you home.

840
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,380
Yes. He was right next to me all along.

841
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Yi-hyun.

842
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,260
Are you seeing anyone by any chance?

843
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,860
What? That's so random.

844
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,420
-Are you?
-No.

845
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,260
Do you snore
or grind your teeth in your sleep?

846
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,740
I don't think so.

847
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,100
Then how about we get married?

848
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,100
Yi-hyun. Tell him you don't want me
to be punished.

849
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,940
He wants to arrest me.

850
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,140
Hey, Sae-bom.

851
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,380
Want to go out?

852
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,540
No.

853
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:52,500
Hey, I told you that day
that I was only joking.

854
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,860
I'm not joking.

855
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,940
I mean it.

856
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:12,940
=Happiness=

857
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,580
(If people suddenly start going crazy...)

858
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,380
(Missed Call: Wife)
(If people suddenly start going crazy...)

859
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,060
(If people suddenly start going crazy...)

860
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,660
You asked me to gather intel
on Han Tae-seok.

861
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,180
(I really can't stand that guy.)

862
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,300
I own a home now.

863
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,420
(It's locked. The units on this floor
and below are public rental units,)

864
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,420
(The ones on the upper floors
are for general sales.)

865
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,260
(We welcome all new residents.)

866
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:54,380
(The ones on the upper floors
are for general sales.)

867
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,420
(A reporter called me.)

868
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,380
There is a way

869
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,380
(-to make money and stay safe.)
-Lee Seung-young!

870
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,100
(There's a problem at the dormitory.)

871
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,340
Where are the critically-ill patients?

872
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,660
(But they're alive.)

873
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,860
(If we stall, more people will be hurt.)
