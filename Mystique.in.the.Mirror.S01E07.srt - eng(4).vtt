00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.660
And about his hospital escape,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.650
how did he manage to get out?

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.990
He might have escaped
through the cemetery.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.970
Why did he escape?

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.990
He's never escaped before.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.170
Who is this man?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.260
You've known him, right?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.620
Who is this man?

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.980
This is all I can help you.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.250
You have to find answers
on your own, boss.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.290
Did you scheme up with
those doctors to deceive me?

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.370
Answer me, Win!

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.500
Would you take me to that room?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.659
There must have
been some connection

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.420
between me and
that room, for sure.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Dad?

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.100
Come back to me.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.660
He's not your father.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.940
Why did you come back?

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.620
We've just parted ways.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.940
I have a bad feeling about this,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.500
so I wanted to come
see if you're alright.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.220
I'm fine.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.380
You should just leave.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.780
I saw your reaction in that room...

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.980
you didn't look so good.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.900
Wait...

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.260
you were crying again?

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.140
Why your eyes seem red?

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.060
No.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.780
I'm just tired.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.900
I want to get some rest now.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.460
Let me stay with you.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.220
I know you're in shock.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.020
I was shocked too.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.260
But I'm worried about you, Alan.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.579
What do you think

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.300
my father has to do with this?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.460
How was he in

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.060
a photograph

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.020
with that guy?

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.820
Did your father know

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.620
that the man you saw in the mirror

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.980
looked like this?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.940
Listen to me, Alan.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.220
It's because you're sick.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.420
You never wrote
down what I said, right?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.380
Don't forget to
take you medicine.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.540
I don't know.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.220
But I think
something's not right.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.380
He said that my dad

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.940
wasn't my dad.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.659
And you believed him?

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.060
Remember.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.420
He is not your father.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.860
Remember.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.340
He is not your father.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.659
Remember.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.020
He is not your father.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.100
Alan.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.580
Alan.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.980
It's me, your dad.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.260
I don't know what
the truth is anymore.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.780
Maybe

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.740
you don't need to find
out the truth right now.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.840
After you're treated,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.020
you'll find out.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.500
It's easy for you to say that.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.580
You're not in the
same situation as me.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.500
Do you know what I feel?

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.980
I feel like everyone's

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.060
trying to hide something from me.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.980
I don't trust anyone anymore.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.020
Even you,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.659
you're hiding something from me too.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.780
Alan.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.820
I've kept something from you

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.220
out of concern
for your feelings.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.620
Win.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.940
If you really loved me,

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.580
you wouldn't have
done this to me.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.100
Something, when you know it,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.620
might take all your
happiness away.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.580
One day, you'll understand.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.100
But I wanted to let you know

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.300
that everything I've done

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.990
I just wanted you to be
happy with the moment.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.180
What did you mean?

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.300
I want you to be
happy with the present.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.820
The past...

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.300
If knowing it makes
you feel this way,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.060
then it'd be best to forget it.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.060
I love you.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.100
Who's that?

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.140
You should go now.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080
Hurry.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.340
Nobody's coming this late.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.500
You're the one who told me

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.020
that if someone
found us together,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.140
you would get in trouble.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.360
Quick.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.300
You have to go now.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.380
Fine.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.820
I don't know.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.300
But I think
something's not right.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.820
He said that my dad

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.900
wasn't my dad.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.980
I don't know what
the truth is anymore.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.980
I feel like

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.220
everyone's trying to
hide something from me.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.980
I don't trust anyone anymore.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.620
Are you sure

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.140
you left them in my car?

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.930
Yeah,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.020
I was the last
person on your car.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.780
Your documents
were brown, right?

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.500
I don't think they're here.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.700
Lemme see.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.260
Guess they're not here.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.140
I'll go look for
them at my home.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.200
Hey.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.100
Next time

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.220
don't leave your stuff around.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.380
So...

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.180
how are things
between you and Pete?

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.300
Why?

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.300
Can't I ask you as a friend?

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.700
Nothing special.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.820
He's adorable, though.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.660
Are you guys dating now?

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.060
Why'd you want to know that?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.940
Are you worrying
about something?

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.060
Hey,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.900
listen.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.520
If you wanna date him,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.860
then go for it.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.180
Even if something goes wrong,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.140
I'll be here anyway.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.660
Okay.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.220
Thanks a lot.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.500
I gotta go.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.500
Get home safe.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.820
Don't assault anyone, okay?

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.580
Asshole.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.380
Doctor O.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920
Hey, you.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.540
Stop messing around,

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.050
I hate that.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.980
Sorry.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.780
So...

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.340
What are doing at your car?

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.660
I was looking for my friend's stuff.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.680
What about you?

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.540
What brings you here?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.860
My shift's just ended,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.480
and then I saw you,

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.060
so I thought I'd
come to say hello.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.580
That's it?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.090
Yeah.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.460
Or

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.340
do you

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.270
want me to do something more?

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.150
Don't be nonsense.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.540
If you don't have any businesses here,

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.780
you should go get some rest now.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.660
Okay.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.580
Doc.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.540
I'm worried about Alan.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.350
What's wrong?

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.980
I was working on my shift earlier,

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.780
and I heard something
coming out of his room.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.700
Wasn't that normal?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.140
No,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.710
I think this time was different.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.860
I'm feeling that he's been
talking to himself more frequently.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.660
Are you sure

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.340
you gave him all the medication?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.860
I gave him all the
pills every time,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.540
and I always double-checked.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.340
If that's the case

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.700
then I'll try to talk
to him tomorrow.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.100
Okay.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.180
Hold up, Doc.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.580
There's actually
something else I'm worried.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.740
Go ahead.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.420
Mister worrisome.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.900
I'd like to speak to you about
Alex's visit to take Alan home.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.540
I believe that won't do anything
good for Alan's condition.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.450
Doesn't this mean we have
to start counting again from 1?

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.420
Wait a second.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.620
Calm down.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.700
First off, you must understand
that this is case

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.660
is Doctor Nil's.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.840
Regardless of

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.580
what Doctor Nil has decided,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.180
we should respect

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.980
his decision.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.180
Come on.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.020
You're now the
owner of Alan's case.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.860
Have a voice in this, will you?

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.580
You really know how to stir things up.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.620
Will you do as I urge?

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.860
I will.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.100
You're the cutest thing ever.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.820
Thank you.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.540
Hey.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.580
What's up?

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.660
I'm going to take back what belongs to me.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.020
I'm just wondering where it is.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.220
Your stuff?

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.850
Did you ask me to keep anything?

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.820
Watch this.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.860
Here, look.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.020
You...

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.380
You really are hasty.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.940
There's no one around here.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.300
Only just the two of us.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.180
Hurry up.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.780
Make it quick!

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.180
Others will see us.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.020
Then you better close your eyes,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.770
so you don't have to see anyone.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.580
Quickly.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.220
I gotta go now.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.180
Got my stuff back.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.580
Bye bye.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.620
Come in.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.420
I'd like to speak to you about Alan's case.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.220
Alex's coming to take Alan home.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.380
Are we really going to allow that?

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.900
That's what the
patient's relative wants.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.580
I'm sorry,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.540
I don't think you should use your personal
feelings when making this decision.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.940
I also disapprove

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.380
with how you asked me to
handle Alan's case for you.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.380
First of all, It wasn't
personal feelings.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.760
Alex and I,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.210
we're just doctor

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.420
and patient's relative.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:45.860
Since we're going to talk now,

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.900
I can be straight
with you, right?

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.900
About you and Pete.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.140
You know about that?

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.380
Actually...

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.860
I didn't want to interfere or
step in with your personal life.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.940
And it's tough for
me to talk about this.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.609
However, many people

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.140
have begun gossiping this,

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.420
and not in a good way.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.420
I don't care

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.780
how people'd percieve me.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.540
I can differentiate

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.900
between work and
personal matters.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.339
I understand
everything you said,

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.940
and I have faith in how
professional you are.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.020
But I had to bring this up

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.040
because I just wanted you
to keep being professional.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.620
I don't want you to waste your time

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.420
on such ridiculous matter.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.820
It's not worth it.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.820
I've been through
that point before.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.900
When we feel good

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.860
or special with someone,

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.860
that's not a ridiculous matter.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.820
And whether or not
it's worth it is irrelevant.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.860
Sometimes we just have to choose, O.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.940
Between work and personal life,

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.540
you can't...

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.700
It's not possible to have them all.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.620
Nil.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.900
With all due respect,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.540
you're a very good doctor,

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.460
and I've always
looked up to you.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.940
But in terms of love,

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.840
I'm not sure whether I'm strong enough

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.820
to be alone as you are.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.260
For me,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.740
I believe it is worth
making a sacrifice

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.100
if that means having
someone in our life

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.740
who'll be by our side every day.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.220
I'd like you to try discussing
this with Alex one more time.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.580
Maybe he would understand

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.220
what we've been
dealing with right now.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.540
Alan.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.620
Time for your medications.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.060
Doctor O.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.660
Where's Pete?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.060
Pete's shift has ended,

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.780
so I'm here to look
after you instead.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.140
Oh.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.250
Have you

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.060
still been sleepwalking lately?

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.940
Not anymore.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.110
Doctor.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.120
Hmm?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.750
Can I ask you

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.780
about the memory?

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.190
What'd you like to know?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.870
Is it possible

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.700
to bring our memory back?

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.900
I mean

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.420
If I have forgotten about it,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.260
would we be able
to draw it back?

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.300
Why are you

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.460
curious all of a sudden?

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.700
I couldn't remember anything about myself.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.500
Who I was.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.060
or who was associated with me.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.220
I have no clue at all.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.340
So I think

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.100
there might have been
some connection between me

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.900
and the old man in the mirror,

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.020
but why was I

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.900
so fearful of him.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.540
Isn't that right?

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.780
Here's the thing.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.700
Few years ago,

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.220
while I'd been studying for
a specialist admissions test,

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.580
I studied the books from morning to night

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.340
to ensure that I
remembered everything.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.500
And I listed my
lectures into topics,

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.940
but one of the topics was missing.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.630
It was

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.940
the cycle of forgetting

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.860
The cycle

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.550
of forgetting?

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.700
You see

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.700
I had researched so many
variations of memory cycles,

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.160
but no matter how hard I looked,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.700
I couldn't find this
"cycle of forgetting."

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.500
So, I went to ask my professor.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.380
Do you know

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.220
what he told me?

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.690
There's no such thing

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.220
as a "cycle of forgetting."

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.940
Only a "cycle of
remembering" exists.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.500
Our brains

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:30.940
have no process of forgetting.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.780
Whenever we started
having memories,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.380
our brains would record them.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.100
Hello, Mr.Alan.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.060
Are you going to the cafeteria?

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.620
Hello, Alan.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.500
The only problem was
that we couldn't find them.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.360
You mean my memories
have never gone missing,

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.620
but I just couldn't find them?

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.060
Correct.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.540
Do you know

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:06.980
that our memories

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.780
are alive?

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.300
They're always
prepared to emerge.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.620
If you concentrate

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.910
and reflect carefully,

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.860
sometimes

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.020
they may resurface old memories

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.860
back for you.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.500
So how come I couldn't
remember much?

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.660
You could remember.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.900
However, your brain

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.260
may have ordered you
not to find the memories.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.860
Maybe it was some kind of mechanism

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.260
that our bodies had developed

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.310
to protect us from
the past trauma

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.220
that was too much to handle.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.020
You were trying to say

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.940
that I had a past trauma,

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.980
and I wanted to forget it.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.260
Then should I try to remember it, doctor?

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.360
If the brain

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.900
instructed us to forget,

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.460
it may have had reasons

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.300
for doing so.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.500
And I also can't

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.140
advise you

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.260
which way is the best for you.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.060
Because acknowledgement

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.880
and acceptance level in a person

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.100
varies amongst individuals.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.530
Take your medicine, Alan.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.580
Good job!

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.660
Then,

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.980
If you'd excuse me.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.700
Alan?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.940
Why did you come back?

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.580
What are you doing here?

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.540
I just needed to
use the restroom.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.770
Nothing else.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.080
Why did you do this?

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.780
How many times
have you done this?

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.830
I've been trying to help you.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.460
Help?

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.580
What have you done to help me?

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.100
I still couldn't
remember anything.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.560
Everyone in this place

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.020
has been trying to help you.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.460
Do I look better?

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.140
If this is all that everyone's
method of helping me can do,

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.210
then don't bother.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.540
Get out, leave me alone.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.900
Get out!

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.740
Nobody needs to help me.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.380
Calm down, Alan.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.140
If you want to get better,

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.340
it's better to cooperate.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.340
Remember.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.420
Remember.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.740
Remember.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.420
Who?

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:49.810
Who's there?

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.280
Remember.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.590
You think you're tough?

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:56.870
Alan.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.020
Remember.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.660
Calm down, Alan.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.860
Leave me alone!

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.380
Leave me alone!

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.460
Alan!

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.180
Alan.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.160
How on earth did
you let this happen?

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.900
You think I wanted
something like this to happen?

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.810
Alan.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.260
Are you alright?

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.620
Are you hurt somewhere?

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.140
I'm fine, Dad.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.060
You don't have to make
a big deal out of this.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.520
I've examined him.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.580
He only got a minor concussion.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.500
Nothing to be concerned about.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.900
When something like this happened,

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.140
how could I not be worried?

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.500
I'd never trust this place again.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.020
I'm taking Alan home.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.620
Let's go, Alan.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.900
Go grab your stuff.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.040
We're going home.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.050
Come.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.180
Wait.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.100
I have something to ask you.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.260
You have a question for me?

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.940
Have you been hiding
something from me?

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.460
No.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.010
I'm not hiding anything.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.940
I'm going to ask you again.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.060
Have you been hiding
something from me?

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.360
Alan.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.190
I told you I didn't hide
anything from you.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.740
I'm going to ask you one last time.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.510
I'll count to three.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.100
1

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.940
2

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.620
3!

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.780
What is this?

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.140
Who is the man in this picture?

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.990
How did you get that picture?

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.660
Doesn't matter
where I got it from.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.170
Answer me!

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.940
How did you get to
take a photo with him?

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.730
Alan, calm down.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.300
Don't yell just
yet, listen to me.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.940
Answer me.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.380
Who is he?

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.140
Well...

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.820
The person I took the picture with

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.300
was someone that I

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.140
and doctor Nil knew.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.100
Who is he, doctor?

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.180
Well, he was the director of this hospital,

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.820
and he brought you here for treatment.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.580
You're indebted to him, Alan.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.700
Right, Doctor Nil?

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.500
Yes.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.940
The man in the picture is
a former hospital's director.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.610
Alex's once donated
to the hospital,

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.380
so they took a picture as a memento.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.100
Then why have I been seeing

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.540
this old man in the
mirror all the time?

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.050
Is this the person

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.700
you mentioned as the old
man you saw in the mirror?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.180
Yes.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.180
Is that so, Alan?

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.580
I've never known before

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.700
that the old man you saw in the mirror

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.740
was him.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.460
That's pretty odd.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.180
If everyone keeps coming
together to deceive me like this,

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.420
I'll have to stick
to doing what I believe in.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.420
- Alan.
- Don't touch me.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.060
Just go home, Dad.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.820
Get out now!

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.300
I don't think we're
doing the right thing.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.740
We're just following orders.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.820
There is no right nor wrong.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.900
That's what I think

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.500
we're doing wrong.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.920
But you're aware that everything I've done

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.220
I was following
orders he requsted me.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.580
And I've tried my best
to accomplish it as well.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.180
I love him just as
much as you do.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.140
I understand.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.740
I didn't think that you and Doctor O

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.620
hadn't given him
proper treatment.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.820
I believe everyone
has tried their best.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.180
But, are you really going
to let him be like this?

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.060
Today, I've seen

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.740
that it wasn't easy

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.140
to deal with him.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.540
Nil.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.900
You're someone
I trusted the most.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.580
And I'm sorry

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.500
if sometimes my words hurted your feelings.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.180
But it's because I was worried.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.300
If we keep doing this,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.530
no one will gain from it,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.620
not even ourselves.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.660
Alex.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.260
Are you tired, Nil?

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.740
Are you?

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.880
Thank you.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.140
Thank you for everything.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.820
Thank you.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.820
I'm okay.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.420
Why?

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.860
You know how I feel,

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.300
and I also know

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.389
- how you feel.
- Alex.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.239
Alex, we shouldn't do this.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.000
You know it's impossible.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.580
The only one who's
making it impossible

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.380
is nobody but you.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.900
Are we ready, Alex?

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:36.980
Are we ready?

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.580
Will you just stop
looking for reasons?

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.900
You've been using
your brain your whole life.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:49.780
Try give your heart a go

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.659
and follow what it says.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.260
At least just for
this moment, please.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.140
Alex, stop.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.100
How long will you be walking around?

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.620
I'm dizzy.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.220
I've gone through every page
of this notebook I got from Si.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:01.780
But, apart from stories about you,

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.220
my true name,

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.540
my father's name,

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.620
a friend's name,

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.060
and this hospital...

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.900
I didn't see anything
else beyond those.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.340
Then why the hell did I see the director?

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.780
He and I must be sharing
some sort of connection.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.860
That must be it.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.180
You've been looking at
the notebook the whole day.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:23.940
Wanna go for a walk
in the garden with me?

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.260
We can do it discreetly,

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.260
so we wouldn't get caught.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.820
Please.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.380
Where's the room...

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.980
Do you know

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.180
where they keep the
patient medical records?

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.420
I...

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.100
don't know.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.820
How would you not know that?

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.900
Haven't you been here for a long time?

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.580
I thought you knew
about everything.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.460
Come on, please tell me.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.800
I really don't know that.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.340
Nevermind,

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.940
I'll go look for it myself.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.500
Alan, chill out.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.020
This is going too
far, don't you think?

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.620
This's always been a big deal, Win.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.020
I know nothing about myself

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.780
and I must find out the truth.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.780
What makes you so sure

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.820
that knowing it will
make you life better?

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.820
We'd been doing well together

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.100
until...

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.100
until you got that
stupid notebook.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.100
Had we really been doing well?

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.540
We're still stuck in this place.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.380
Did boyfriends

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.020
and lovers

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.060
have to go sneaking
in the garden

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.780
or secretly climb windows
just to meet each other?

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.740
Answer me.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.780
And if I have to choose

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.560
between the truth

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.060
and you,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.660
I'd best go with the truth.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.060
Because, at least,

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.340
the truth won't lie to me

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.340
and treat me like an idiot.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.860
Alan.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.350
I have never thought
of you that way.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.180
Enough, Win.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.260
You were the only one I trusted,

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.020
yet you still lied to me.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.140
It's fine if you're
not going to help me.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.340
I'll do it alone.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.020
Please don't do this.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.420
Are you going to leave the room,

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.830
or will I have to?

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.190
Alright.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.980
Scan here, please.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.860
Hold up,

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.070
doctor O has already
informed

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.020
that this patient has diabetes.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.500
He can't have this tray.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.620
I'll have to go check the
record in the computer.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.060
Do not serve the meal yet.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.900
How the heck do I get in?

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.860
Oh, Pete.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.540
Alan.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.100
Perfect timing.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:26.340
Would you...

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.380
Where's your keycard?

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.940
In the pocket over here.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.160
In my pants's pocket.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.220
Could you please
take it out for me?

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.460
Thanks.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.660
Thank you.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.220
Do you need help
carrying those files?

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.220
Sure, Alan.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.900
Alright.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:51.700
Alan.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.900
May I have my keycard back?

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:55.580
Oh.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.110
Thanks.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.980
Let's get inside.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.860
Put it right over there, Alan.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.340
Thanks.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.820
I need a moment to update the
patient's information into the computer.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.100
Okay.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.660
Are you alright, Alan?

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.300
Sorry, I accidently
knocked down these files.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.060
That's alright, I'll help
putting them back.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.740
I'm really sorry.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.690
It's okay, let me help.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.980
Sorry.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.540
I'm making you
work slower, am I?

00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.820
Don't worry about it.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.420
Give me a moment to
update the patient's information.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.940
Okay.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.370
Thanks, Alan.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.460
Alright.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.180
Alan,

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.940
Alan, where are you going?

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.220
Alan!

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.840
Wait!

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.240
Alan.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.380
What now!

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.580
Are you never going to trust me?

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.380
Trust?

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.980
This word again, Win?

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:38.660
I once trusted you most, you know?

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.060
But so what?

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.200
You've lied to me

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.940
even more than those fuckers!

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.340
Stop!

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.700
I not letting you go.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.420
Don't you feel the
same way about me?

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.980
Do you realize how
much pain I've been in?

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.540
Hmm?

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.860
The lies from others
weren't that bad.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.500
But the lies you told

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.580
were the most agonizing!

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.780
And how could you be so sure

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.260
that the truth you've
been seeking...

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.700
wouldn't hurt you?

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.140
What if it separates
us from each other?

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.060
You'd let that happen?

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.900
Let me tell you something, Win.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:24.180
The lies

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.340
can never develop into love.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:29.920
Will you let me go?

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.490
No.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.500
Please don't go.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.280
Help.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.200
Help, a patient's escaping.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.380
Help me.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.100
Help!

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.860
- Help!
- Keep your voice down.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.960
Win.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.540
Please help!

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.380
This way!

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.780
Help!

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.100
Help.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.860
Help!

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.700
Help, a patient's escaping.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.050
Help!

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.540
Help...

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.100
Does it hurt?

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.380
Please understand me.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.140
But today, I must learn the truth.
