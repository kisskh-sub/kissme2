I don't even understand why I did that.

I guess I wanted to do something...

43
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,360

all of them...

were totally crazy.

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,480
What more can we do?

58
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,761
How did you know a flash grenade would work?

59
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:49,430
The soldiers wouldn't carry them
unless they worked.

60
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:51,271
They are here to surveil the infected,

61
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,840
not to stop terrorist attacks.

62
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,670
A number of the infected
tried to escape the facility once.

63
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,040
That's when we found out.

64
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:02,581
So you're just locking them up there
and waiting for them to die?

65
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,451
What else could we do then?

66
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,350
They are not rational.
They are only looking for fresh blood.

67
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:09,850
Should we give them living humans
for every meal?

68
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,621
But they are still alive.

69
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,061
We must hold out somehow.

70
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,821
We are holding out now.

71
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,030
We are protecting patients
who show mild symptoms.

72
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,501
And we're isolating patients
who show severe symptoms.

73
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,530
Look, Mr. Han.

74
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,501
What if your family was in there?

75
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:28,240
Let's be honest.

76
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:30,540
You consider them monsters.

77
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,441
You have no problem shooting them
if they come at you.

78
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,180
Do you know what we learned from COVID-19?

79
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,350
What?

80
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,590
The importance of washing hands?

81
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,061
Getting by is more important than...

82
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,360
a few people biting and killing each other.

so I can protect my family.

84

How much longer will you
keep running this operation in secret?

85
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:11,151
Disclose everything to the public.

86
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:13,751
And we need to discuss
and decide on how to treat the infected.

87
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:14,980
We will.

88
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,951

Do it quickly.

90

Or I'll expose you.

Let's not cross paths
if we can help it.

Oh, right.

93
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:43,350
They are still holding out too.

94
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:45,780

in a separate account.

98

And I already planned my itinerary for my trip.

99
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:03,790
I can't believe this.

100
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,030
Give me your hand.

101
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,910
Hey, it's almost healed.

102
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,780
This will sting.

103
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,991
Is it okay that I'm the only one
who's getting better?

104
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:36,231
Hey, it's a relief
that you're getting better at least.

105
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:40,101
I'm sure they'll develop medicine
and vaccines for this soon.

106
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:43,930
And I'm sure...

107
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,341
we'll be able to get through this too.

108
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,971
So don't you worry.

109
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,780
Can those people...

110
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,810
come back too?

111
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:03,190
I hope so.

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,241
Did you look into the T-shirt?

114
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:26,481
The large T-shirt.

115
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,611
I was busy today.

116
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,710
I'll bring it next time.

117

Sae Bom! Mom, she's the SOU officer
who lives across the hall.

118
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:58,570
Hello. Seo Yoon told me how you took care of her.

119
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:00,410
Thank you.

120
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,991
That place was nice, wasn't it?

121
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:26,940
Is he your husband?

122
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,141
He's handsome.

125
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:15,351
I found it.

126
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:17,651
Okay.

127
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Are you okay?

128
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:32,901
It's nothing...

129
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:36,210
It feels a bit strange
to go back to our lives so easily.

130
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,741
Should we do this later?

131
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:42,210
No, we're doing this
so that we can get back to our lives.

132
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Let's do it.

133
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
But...

134
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:51,320
do you think she'd believe
that we're getting married?

135
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:54,420
Of course.
She'll think that we're madly in love,

136
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:55,491
so don't worry.

137
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,601
Here. Chamomile tea.

138
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,861
It'll warm you up.

139
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,030
Do I look okay?

140
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Yes.

141
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,271
Look at me and then answer.

142
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,180
Okay. Let me see.

143
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,950
You look pretty.

144
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:27,621
Who would think we got married
because of an apartment?

145
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,491
Of course, they'd think we like each other.

146
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,060
- You're so...
- Sae Bom.

147
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,501
Hello, Mother.

148
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,731
I knew you guys would end up together
from the moment I saw you.

149
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,440
I went to school,
and you guys were sitting in the ambulance together,

150
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,570
and you looked great together.

151
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,741
Oh, that photo is from that day.

152
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:48,210
We didn't want to forget where we started.

153
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:52,381
Sae Bom, there's something I wanted to tell you.

154
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,320
Yes, what is it?

155
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,991
Son, can you excuse yourself?
I have to say something to Sae Bom.

156
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,960
Just tell me later.
I'll relay the message to her.

157
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,930
Are your upstairs neighbours noisy?

158
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:08,530
That'll end up causing problems.

159
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,170
Go tell them to be quiet.

160
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,710
What do you want to tell me?

161
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,381
Sae Bom. Thank you so much.

162
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:25,280
I think Yi Hyun is living a normal life
thanks to you.

163
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:30,290
Mother, Yi Hyun has always been okay.

164
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,190
He's a good kid,

165
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,361
but he gets emotional sometimes.

166
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,731
After he had to quit playing baseball,

167
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,991
he started hanging out with the wrong crowd.

168
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,330
That's why I was planning on immigrating to the US,

169
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:44,001
but he said he didn't want to go
because he couldn't speak English.

170
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,971
I think he likes being a detective.

171
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,570
He can catch bad guys.

172
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:02,320
It's late, but I was wondering
if something happened.

173
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,450
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't come to get an apology.

174
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:08,091
I'm really worried. Are you okay?

175
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,991
Yes.

176
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Hello.

177
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,330
I live downstairs, and it's a bit noisy.

178
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,570
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:20,940
Wait.

180
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,611
I couldn't say anything yesterday,

181
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,981
but my wife is sick.

182
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:31,710
She keeps throwing things and screaming.

183
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,881
Who is she?

184
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:38,391
She's a manager at my wife's dermatology clinic.

185
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,690
She came here to help as she was worried.

186
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:48,361
She took some sleeping pills and went to bed,

187
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,800
so it'll be okay soon.

188
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:51,800
Does she bite or scratch?

189
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:56,040
No, she doesn't.
It just seems like she's sensitive.

190
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,910
We won't be loud again. I'm sorry.

191
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,810
What's wrong?

192
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,021
What's...

193
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:15,320
the name of the dermatology clinic?

194
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,930
I feel like we should have a wedding.

195
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,200
Who should officiate it?

196
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,501
Well...

197
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:25,901
Jung Guk?

198
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,440
I guess that makes sense.

199
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:31,310
But is he good at speaking
in front of people?

200
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,381
No.

201
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,780
We could just forgo the officiator.

202
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,851
We could just say, "We'll be happy."

203
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:41,881
That sounds good.

204
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,290
Seung Young is a great singer.

205
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,761
It would be nice if he got better by then.

206
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,930
Do we need to go on a honeymoon?

207
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Where do you want to go?

208
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,861
Anywhere you've always wanted to go.

209
00:17:56,871 --> 00:18:00,041
What are you going to do
if I say I want to go on a buffet tour?

210
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:02,670
We can't leave until you have at least ten plates a place.

211
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,510
Excuse me. I'm a former baseball player.

212
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:07,281
I eat an alarming amount of food.

213
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:09,081
Gosh.

214
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,811
Thinking about food is making me hungry.

215
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,450
Let's go to sleep.

216
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,450
Okay. Good night.

217
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,420
- You too.
- Okay.

218
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,670
The number of patients suffering
from mad person disease...

219
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,710
where you bite and suck the blood of others
is increasing.

220
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,010
However, the government is saying
they have not verified...

221
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,381
the nature of this disease...

222
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,910
- and is wary of making statements.
- Honey.

223
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,220
- Meanwhile...
- Honey.

224
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:23,321
We don't have that kind of money.

225
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:25,020
Are we going to just live like this?

226
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:26,891
What if she ends up collapsing?

227
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:29,791
Why would you say something so unlucky?

228
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,631
She didn't have any problems until now.

229
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,500
She'll be fine if we help her manage it well.

230
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,401
She already gets discriminated against
for living in a rental.

231
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,930
What if they find out she's sick?

232
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm going to visit Sae Bom.

233
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,740
We could say it was to study the language and go quietly.

234
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,341
Nobody will know.

235
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:44,970
Honey.

236
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,680
Where can I get the money for that?

237
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,990
Sae Bom. It's me, Seo Yoon.

238
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,031
Hello! I have some leftover rice cakes.
Want some?

239
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:09,301
Can I eat some?

240
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,341
Love can face a crisis too.

241
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:20,141
It must've been a serious crisis.

242
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,740
Where's your husband?

243
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:23,811
At work.

244
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,781
He had orders from the higher-ups.

245
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,051
(Skin and Hair Dermatology Clinic)

246
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:29,121
(Park Min Ji, Chief of Dermatology)

247
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,851
- Hello?
- Hello.

248
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,591
Is Dr. Park Min Ji in?

249
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,730
Oh, right. Dr. Park has taken the week off.

250
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,891
She can take appointments starting next week.

251
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,930
Did the manager take off too?

252
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:45,930
The manager? Which manager are you talking about?

253
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,571
She has long hair down
to her waist and double eyelids.

254
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,970
Ms. Woo Sang Hee.
She took the day off.

255
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,281
There she is. Hold on.

256
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,121
What is this?

257
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,351
Are you going to get a facial?

258
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:05,891
It's because of the people
who live upstairs from us.

259
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,960
Oh, are they noisy?

260
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,490
That could drive people crazy.

261
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,960
Hey. By the way, that car wash?

262
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,000
They want us to stop investigating.

263
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,170
Another team is going to take care of it,

264
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,470
so they want us to stop.

265
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Han Tae Seok?

266
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,071
Are you sure things will be okay?

267
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,210
Are you sure it's not a dangerous disease?

268
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,420
(Ms. Kim Bok Nam)

269
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,031
Hi, Mom.

270
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,331
Are you all right?

271
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,561
You got tested for the mad person disease.

272
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,270
I'm fine.

273
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,301
But I have to be quarantined.

274
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:55,940
Turn on the TV.

275
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,811
There's a huge fuss.

276
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,811
Is...

277
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,651
someone there?

278
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,321
They're not human.

279
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:18,131
None of them are.

280
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:22,000
The clip you just saw...

281
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,801
was sent exclusively to us.

282
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:25,670
I will repeat.

283
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,500
Our station is the only one
to get a copy of this.

284
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:32,440
An anonymous informant infiltrated a government facility,

285
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:35,311
took this with his phone, and sent it to us.

286
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:36,980
- The government...
- Are you seeing this?

287
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,381
didn't admit it existed,

288
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,581
and this disease only existed in rumours.

289
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:43,791
This so-called "mad person disease" actually exists,

290
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:46,621
causing the infected
to bite humans and drink their blood.

291
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,420
The government covered this up...

292
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,690
I'll call you back.

293
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,690
This is the only evidence we have.

294
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,260
The informant sent us this video from their phone,

295
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:56,930
but we've since lost touch.

296
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,240
Our staff is doing all they can to find out...

297
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:03,000
what happened to the informant.

298
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,111
Darn it.

299
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,821
What's this?

300
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:17,151
Will the government ban public gatherings
when I just opened?

301
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:23,490
I want to bite everyone.
Send me to a hospital.

302
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,791
You just said you thought it was COVID-19.

303
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,091
It's mad person disease!

304
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:30,531
Get him off me.

305
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,041
Don't say such dangerous things.

306
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,510
Play nice.

307
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,051
Are you all right now?

308
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,051
Where are you going?

309
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:51,351
We need to get tested.

310
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,621
I'm going to a hospital.

311
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,720
Darn you...

312
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,520
Then the investigation will get pushed back.

313
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,960
Welcome.

314
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:27,690
- Have a taste.
- Okay.

315
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:38,670
Do you want one?

316
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,341
Yes.

317
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,801
Do I leave this here?

318
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,770
Bye.

319
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:48,740
Are you going camping?

320
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:53,321
They sent out a warning text
and no one's hoarding?

321
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,480
We get them all the time now.

322
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:57,690
We can't react to every single one.

323
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:00,920
If a few people die and thousands get infected,
then maybe.

324
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,460
Do you need this delivered?

325
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,591
- Just the rice and bottled water.
- Okay.

326
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,141
(Please cooperate)

327
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,311
(A resident kicked open a door.)

328
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,940
This is me.

329
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:20,240
What's the matter?

330
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,210
I'm the resident representative.
I live in Unit 1202.

331
00:25:27,781 --> 00:25:29,881
I blurred your face for privacy's sake.

332
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,990
From now on, I'd like you to be more careful.

333
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:35,220
What if a fire broke out
and that door was locked?

334
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,190
That door is called...

335
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,831
a firewall and is meant to block flames.

336
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,000
It's to make sure the fire doesn't spread.

337
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:46,031
What would happen if it were kept open?

338
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,871
The fire would spread.

339
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,341
You can keep the door shut
but not blocked or locked.

340
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,141
Then no one can evacuate either.

341
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,041
The decision was made by the fire marshal.

342
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,480
Excuse me.

343
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:59,351
The fire marshal is someone
who works for the company we hired.

344
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,520
Do you mean to say
you're following their opinion?

345
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:03,291
Who are you?

346
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,151
I'm in Unit 401.

347
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,490
Public rental...

348
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:14,861
You know the doctor in Unit 601, don't you?

349
00:26:15,361 --> 00:26:18,301
She says random visitors
are giving her a hard time.

350
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:20,170
Her husband says...

351
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,041
she's so sick and stressed out,
she can't even see patients.

352
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,611
They said that?

353
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,210
After making loud banging noises at night?

354
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,341
Miss.

355
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,611
You can't pinpoint the origin of a sound
when it's through walls.

356
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,821
What I'm saying is that you can't be sure
who's making the noise.

357
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,020
Stop fighting...

358
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,321
and come to church.

359
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,551
The Lord knows everything.

360
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:40,621
(How much does Jesus love you?)

361
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,391
The lady from Unit 601 must be having a hard time.

362
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,831
She could get a lot of peace
if she were to believe in the Lord.

363
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,541
She has her husband,
so I'm sure she'll be fine.

364
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,901
You damaged the steel door,

365
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,071
but I'll make sure you're not held responsible.

366
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,341
I am so grateful.

367
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,831
- This is a lot of stuff.
- Thank you.

368
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,930
Hello.

369
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:00,740
Is your boss still sick?

370
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,910
Yes. She's taking a break for a while...

371
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,371
and told me to get some stuff.

372
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,210
She must be quitting.

373
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:09,010
You packed all her personal belongings.

374
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:10,651
What are you doing?

375
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,720
I'm a detective.

376
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:18,151
I'll ask a few questions.
Think carefully before answering.

377
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,420
What is happening...

378
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:23,220
in that apartment?

379
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:33,101
Are you sure your wife's okay?

380
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,000
Yes. I'll have her admitted today.

381
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,670
Will you bear with us?

382
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:42,841
What is this?

383
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,051
Were you bitten?

384
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,020
Did she bite you?

385
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:54,190
Ma'am!

386
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:55,760
What are you doing?

387
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,430
You can't barge into my house.

388
00:28:58,131 --> 00:29:00,160
Housebreaking is against the law.

389
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,230
Report me, then.

390
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,200
I'm from downstairs.

391
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,801
- Are you okay?
- Don't do that.

392
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:10,940
Don't knock.

393
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,910
How long has she been like this?

394
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,180
For two days.

395
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:16,950
She lunges at people.

396
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:18,281
I was going to...

397
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:22,651
call a psychiatrist friend of mine.

398
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,020
And her eyes?

399
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:25,950
The pupils turned white.

400
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:29,960
They're not like this all the time.

401
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,091
She's quiet.

402
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,101
She could be normal now.

403
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:44,970
Ma'am.

404
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,520
Ma'am.

405
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,881
It's okay.

406
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,190
You can get better.

407
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,631
Your husband is worried about you.

408
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,430
If you come out...

409
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:07,230
Mister!

410
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,121
Ma'am.

411
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,121
Ma'am.

412
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:11,391
Calm down.

413
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:15,331
Ma'am.

414
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,470
Emergency services?

415
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,071
I think my wife has mad person disease.

416
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:28,980
My downstairs neighbour could be in danger.

417
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:32,811
- Do you want to get out?
- Come to Seyang...

418
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:33,881
I will...

419
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:37,250
- open...
- It's Unit 601 in Building 101.

420
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:38,450
the door.

421
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:42,861
No. It's Unit 601 in Building 101.

422
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:48,531
You're frustrating me.
It's Building 101, not Building 102.

423
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,430
Send them over now.

424
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,970
I'm serious. It's an emergency.

425
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,841
You have to hurry!

426
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,450
Someone could be dead!

427
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,920
Please hurry. You have to come here now.

428
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,821
Come on. It's an emergency.

429
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,920
Hurry. Gosh.

430
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:15,821
Hey.

431
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,601
What... Min Ji.

432
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,801
Min Ji!

433
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,680
- Sae Bom.
- What?

434
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,881
Don't go upstairs.
Even if you hear any sounds, ignore them.

435
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,210
I'm already upstairs.

436
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:41,651
I'm all right. But that couple...

437
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,101
Sir! No one is home.

438
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:55,531
Sir!

439
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:33,325
Seo Yoon, hurry!

440
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:44,165
Please help!

441
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,466
Are you okay?

442
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:13,696
I think so.

443
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:21,406
That lady...

444
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:23,636
What's wrong with her?

445
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:29,315
She's just very angry.
You're all right.

446
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:32,486
Her husband is over there.

447
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:49,366
Hey.

448
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:52,205
You live downstairs from us. Right?

449
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:53,736
Is everyone all right?

450
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:55,506
Are you all right?

451
00:35:03,216 --> 00:35:05,386
You're lucky I punched you.

452
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:07,785
You would've been dead
if Sae Bom punched you.

453
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:12,056
Breathe.

454
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:13,285
Over here.

455
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:16,355
He must be in shock to see his wife like that.

456
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:52,026
(Receipt)

457
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:01,265
You have to see her yourself.

458
00:37:01,565 --> 00:37:03,236
We need a weapon.

459
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,236
No. Not a gas gun. Something stronger.

460
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:08,205
You're just leaving?

461
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:09,875
Is that all you're going to do?

462
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,105
We'll disinfect the building as well.

463
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:13,475
Avoid leaving the house.

464
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:15,076
And follow the guidelines set by the government.

465
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:34,866
- Let's go.
- We should hurry too.

466
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:23,245
(Water, toilet paper, shampoo, eggs,
rice, marinated beef ribs)

467
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:25,815
(Apple juice, orange juice, and raspberry juice)

468
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,886
(Order)

469
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:29,855
(Notice for delayed delivery)

470
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:35,426
Honey.

471
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:37,665
Honey?

472
00:38:40,665 --> 00:38:42,765
Honey. Do you know what happened?

473
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:44,006
You didn't even feed me.

474
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:46,265
Where were you all day?

475
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:47,576
Gosh.

476
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:51,506
- Everyone.
- Hey, Dong Hyun.

477
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:54,475
I assure you that when the stock prices start to go up,

478
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:56,515
- that means they've been rigged.
- Dong Hyun.

479
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:57,846
You can't start buying...

480
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:00,046
only stocks of bio-enterprises
because of the mad person disease.

481
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:01,116
Promise me.

482
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:03,756
Dong Hyun, you know,
I was on the sixth floor today.

483
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:05,926
Mom, can't you see
that I'm on my show right now?

484
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:07,156
Let's talk later.

485
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:10,156
- Gosh. Hey.
- My mom can be dense sometimes.

486
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:17,535
(The briefing will begin shortly.)

487
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:21,335
I will share our information
on the mad person disease.

488
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:25,205
The authorities have confirmed
that there were patients...

489
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:26,506
who began biting people...

490
00:39:26,506 --> 00:39:28,676
at the nursing homes and homeless shelters.

491
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:32,446
And while conducting a thorough analysis
on the patients,

492
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,486
we have confirmed that the mad person disease...

493
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:38,656
is indeed real.

494
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:42,826
According to our analysis,
it is a variant of the virus.

495
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:45,826
Once infected, they only attack other people...

496
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:47,696
and try to bite their necks.

497
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:49,136
And we have confirmed...

498
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:52,705
that they experience extreme thirst
right before their symptoms show up.

499
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:53,866
(Call 1639 when symptoms appear.)

500
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:55,276
When you feel any of these symptoms...

501
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:58,105
or find anyone with these symptoms,
please call...

502
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:02,015
the Central Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters
immediately.

503
00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:03,415
(Call 1639 when symptoms appear.)

504
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:07,756
He's made it to the big league.
He's on TV now.

505
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:12,225
He didn't talk about
how they were going to isolate the infected.

506
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,926
The mad person disease alone is shocking.

507
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,926
They'll criticize the government
for not developing the medicine...

508
00:40:18,995 --> 00:40:20,765
and ask when it'll be ready
for the time being.

509
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:22,395
They'll focus on that first.

510
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:24,966
That's not important right now.

511
00:40:25,835 --> 00:40:27,406
Don't go into other people's houses alone.

512
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:28,975
Tell me before you do that.

513
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:30,636
I was going to.

514
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:32,006
I was just going to check
if it was the mad person disease...

515
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,576
and call 911 then.

516
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:36,846
But the lady upstairs...

517
00:40:38,585 --> 00:40:40,315
only went after her husband.

518
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:42,716
I'm sure there's something going on.

519
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:45,225
Pushing me wasn't a mistake either.

520
00:40:46,526 --> 00:40:49,026
I'll look into it, and if there's a problem,
I'll arrest him.

521
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,125
Okay.

522
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,096
It's nice to have a detective friend.

523
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:53,725
Of course.

524
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:04,645
Want to go for a walk?

525
00:41:05,406 --> 00:41:07,076
We haven't left the house together
since we moved in.

526
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:16,886
Are you guys going out?

527
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:18,455
Yes.

528
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:20,026
Is something wrong?

529
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:26,125
I wanted to ask
that you keep what happened today a secret.

530
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,895
Don't post it up anywhere...

531
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:29,796
and don't tell people about it.

532
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:33,335
A lot of people saw the incident though.

533
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:36,076
They all live in our apartment.

534
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:38,375
It's hard for outsiders to get in here.

535
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:40,645
It'll be okay
as long as we are in agreement to keep quiet...

536
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,245
and brush it off as nothing.

537
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:44,645
You must think
that it'll make everything go away then.

538
00:41:46,716 --> 00:41:49,386
Bad rumours don't help the price of our apartment.

539
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:52,285
Are you thinking about the price of our apartment now?

540
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:57,296
Aren't you planning on living here
for at least the next ten years?

541
00:41:58,026 --> 00:42:00,225
Wouldn't it be better for you to live...

542
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:02,196
in an expensive apartment?

543
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:17,515
The resident representative is right.

544
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:20,185
The world is turned upside-down,

545
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:22,216
but this place is so peaceful.

546
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,085
I would want to enjoy the pleasures of...

547
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:27,256
high apartment prices...

548
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:29,855
and happiness.

549
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:32,765
Even if that means erasing those
who have been infected if necessary.

550
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:25,015
Thank you for your kind gesture earlier today.

551
00:43:25,846 --> 00:43:27,346
It really hit the spot.

552
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:28,955
Did they tell you to go home?

553
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:31,026
My tests results came out so clean...

554
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:33,526
that they told me to go home and self-quarantine.

555
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,995
Be understanding if it's a bit noisy at night.

556
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,625
You'll be quarantined in prison soon.

557
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:39,796
Don't worry too much.

558
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:41,096
Prison?

559
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:43,895
When I'm done quarantining,
you'll be the first person...

560
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:45,806
I file a complaint against.

561
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:47,435
You messed with the wrong person.

562
00:43:47,506 --> 00:43:49,435
I'm amazing at filing complaints...

563
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:51,205
and suing people. I'm the king of it!

564
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:08,196
I found this in the home of a person
who's been infected.

565
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:17,035
It seems like you took care of the dealers
in the car wash too.

566
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:20,835
You get mad person disease
if you take that pill, right?

567
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:26,375
I doubt you came...

568
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:29,216
all the way here just to ask me that.

569
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:33,185
Park Min Ji is here, isn't she?

570
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,116
I'd like to meet her.

571
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:50,736
Be careful.

572
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:55,605
Ms. Park?

573
00:45:02,475 --> 00:45:04,346
Shouldn't she be back to normal?

574
00:45:06,815 --> 00:45:07,915
She should...

575
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:09,616
be dead already.

576
00:45:10,455 --> 00:45:12,185
The disease developed right before she died,

577
00:45:12,756 --> 00:45:14,285
and she's alive right now thanks to the virus.

578
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:16,656
So when she comes back to normal...

579
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:18,926
She'll probably die.

580
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:21,636
The inside of her head is a mess.

581
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:23,835
It seems like she knows this...

582
00:45:24,406 --> 00:45:25,565
as she's continuously in that state.

583
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:28,736
It could be because she feels like it's unfair.

584
00:45:28,806 --> 00:45:31,006
She wants to tell the world who killed her.

585
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:35,815
Ms. Park.

586
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:38,685
Don't worry.

587
00:45:39,346 --> 00:45:40,616
I will catch...

588
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,585
the person who did this to you.

589
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,076
Darn it.

590
00:46:34,306 --> 00:46:35,475
I know I'm late.

591
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:37,736
I had a lot to take care of.

592
00:46:41,346 --> 00:46:42,576
Where am I?

593
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:44,046
If I were to borrow your words,

594
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:46,386
this is where we keep our guard dogs.

595
00:46:47,145 --> 00:46:49,355
Your friends are behind you,
so be careful not to wake them.

596
00:46:53,725 --> 00:46:56,596
An ordinary woman living in
an ordinary apartment complex...

597
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:57,895
developed the disease,

598
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:00,526
but we found this in her home.

599
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:02,765
Did you sell this to the people...

600
00:47:05,265 --> 00:47:06,366
at Seyang Forest Le Ciel?

601
00:47:08,776 --> 00:47:09,806
Will you let me go...

602
00:47:11,846 --> 00:47:12,906
if I tell you?

603
00:47:14,006 --> 00:47:15,846
Why do you think you're here?

604
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,026
If...

605
00:47:27,426 --> 00:47:29,125
If you promise to let me live,

606
00:47:29,895 --> 00:47:31,096
I'll tell you everything.

607
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:39,136
If there's something that you really want,

608
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:40,705
you don't surrender until you get it.

609
00:47:40,906 --> 00:47:41,975
So...

610
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,375
think about...

611
00:47:49,446 --> 00:47:50,676
what you really want.

612
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:00,902
Aren't you going to cook?

613
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:03,973
How long are you going to lay down for?

614
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:05,743
I don't have energy...

615
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:09,212
after being so surprised yesterday.

616
00:48:10,243 --> 00:48:12,453
You're so weak.

617
00:48:12,683 --> 00:48:13,913
Goodness.

618
00:48:14,112 --> 00:48:16,353
- I'm going to go out and eat.
- Honey.

619
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,893
I want a hamburger.

620
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:21,362
You should eat rice!

621
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:22,692
Bread isn't as good as rice!

622
00:48:22,763 --> 00:48:23,962
Goodness.

623
00:48:24,522 --> 00:48:26,132
My gosh.

624
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:36,402
Hello?

625
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:39,672
Ms. Park just passed away.

626
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:42,842
In the end, she didn't even try to come at people.

627
00:48:42,913 --> 00:48:44,043
She just laid there in a daze.

628
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:47,313
Thank you for telling me.

629
00:49:01,763 --> 00:49:02,833
This is the report from the NFS.

630
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:06,533
Let's go.

631
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:09,043
Right now? Will it be okay?

632
00:49:09,103 --> 00:49:10,643
We're not even sure yet.

633
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:12,043
Don't worry.
I know someone who can help us.

634
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:13,342
Hey, be careful.

635
00:49:13,842 --> 00:49:16,342
If you fail to catch him after this,
it'll only cause more trouble!

636
00:49:19,552 --> 00:49:20,652
We're the police.

637
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:21,783
Excuse us.

638
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:24,752
Why are you shoving your way into my house?

639
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:28,623
How can you both be so rude?

640
00:49:33,732 --> 00:49:34,862
Ms. Park Min Ji.

641
00:49:36,862 --> 00:49:38,103
She's dead.

642
00:49:47,743 --> 00:49:48,743
My wife...

643
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:53,913
She had a tough life.

644
00:49:56,822 --> 00:49:59,152
Hey. What are you after?

645
00:50:02,163 --> 00:50:06,132
Gosh. You cleaned up in the meantime.

646
00:50:07,493 --> 00:50:10,433
I didn't like the smell of blood,
and I feared the germs too.

647
00:50:10,502 --> 00:50:12,172
That's why. So what?

648
00:50:21,543 --> 00:50:22,612
By the way,

649
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:25,212
did you wipe your golf clubs too?

650
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:29,422
Your wife's skull was smashed in.

651
00:50:31,183 --> 00:50:33,453
Exactly where you hit her with your golf club.

652
00:50:34,353 --> 00:50:35,623
It was self-defence.

653
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:38,433
She was trying to bite me.
What else could I have done?

654
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,263
If not for the mad person disease,

655
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,203
you'd have gotten your way.

656
00:50:42,263 --> 00:50:43,833
- Right?
- What?

657
00:50:43,902 --> 00:50:45,672
She should've died...

658
00:50:45,732 --> 00:50:47,703
when you hit her with the club.

659
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:49,442
But then she got infected...

660
00:50:49,502 --> 00:50:51,473
and just wouldn't die.

661
00:50:51,743 --> 00:50:53,013
If not for that,

662
00:50:53,413 --> 00:50:55,382
you'd have managed to discard her body...

663
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:57,712
and commit a perfect crime.

664
00:50:57,982 --> 00:51:01,212
A perfect crime? What are you talking about?

665
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:05,853
This is the NFS report on the blood
found on the golf club.

666
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:08,862
"A swing that requires the full power of a grown man."

667
00:51:09,623 --> 00:51:11,563
"Shards of the occipital bone
and brain tissue were found."

668
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:14,563
"The weapon was swung with intent to kill."

669
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:17,163
I told you. I was scared.

670
00:51:17,232 --> 00:51:19,902
Her eyes were white,
and she rushed at me to bite me.

671
00:51:19,973 --> 00:51:21,942
If you were me, would you...

672
00:51:22,002 --> 00:51:23,842
just let your wife bite you to death?

673
00:51:23,902 --> 00:51:25,373
Do you love her that much?

674
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:28,612
That's why I checked your court files too.

675
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:30,212
I was quite impressed.

676
00:51:30,513 --> 00:51:32,382
Illegal medical practices and a revoked license.

677
00:51:32,453 --> 00:51:34,083
You even filed for bankruptcy.

678
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:38,353
You handed over your clinic to your wife.

679
00:51:38,752 --> 00:51:40,322
You must've thought that...

680
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:43,462
you could make a comeback if she died.

681
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:47,732
So what? What are you trying to say?

682
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:51,603
Dozens of people saw my wife
walking around completely normal.

683
00:51:51,672 --> 00:51:53,603
How on earth will you prove...

684
00:51:54,473 --> 00:51:55,473
that I...

685
00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:58,272
killed my wife?

686
00:52:00,212 --> 00:52:01,473
We have a witness.

687
00:52:08,683 --> 00:52:09,822
Sang Hee.

688
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:15,922
Oh Ju Hyung, you're under arrest
for murdering your wife Park Min Ji.

689
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:43,083
Honey.

690
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:12,482
Cordon off as planned.

691
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:13,982
Sir.

692
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,422
Delay it, and more will get sick.

693
00:53:25,563 --> 00:53:26,563
Yes.

694
00:53:34,473 --> 00:53:35,473
(Orange juice)

695
00:53:42,643 --> 00:53:43,643
Can you...

696
00:53:47,112 --> 00:53:48,353
Excuse me.

697
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:07,272
I decided to get the surgery.

698
00:54:09,172 --> 00:54:10,272
You made up your mind?

699
00:54:11,103 --> 00:54:13,272
Mom's worried about it,

700
00:54:13,373 --> 00:54:16,342
but she's also worried the disease will spread here.

701
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:19,482
My wounds take a while to heal.

702
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:21,752
I use antibiotics too.

703
00:54:23,183 --> 00:54:26,592
I said we should pack up now
and leave quietly for surgery.

704
00:54:27,623 --> 00:54:28,723
When do you leave?

705
00:54:28,993 --> 00:54:31,763
Mom will take me to get tested
once she's back.

706
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:36,333
That's the guy I saw on TV.

707
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:39,873
Is he your friend?

708
00:54:40,603 --> 00:54:42,703
No. He's just someone I know.

709
00:54:44,002 --> 00:54:45,172
Why are you here?

710
00:54:45,643 --> 00:54:48,942
The mad person disease is spreading in your complex.

711
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:55,882
There was one positive case.

712
00:54:57,322 --> 00:54:58,652
Are there more?

713
00:54:59,453 --> 00:55:01,123
I grilled the dealer.

714
00:55:02,322 --> 00:55:04,723
He sold the pills in the basement gym.

715
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:08,632
He said they would improve concentration and weight loss.

716
00:55:09,163 --> 00:55:10,163
The buyers...

717
00:55:11,502 --> 00:55:13,533
included Park Min Ji from Unit 601.

718
00:55:14,002 --> 00:55:16,672
- Hello.
- Hello.

719
00:55:19,643 --> 00:55:20,643
Thank you.

720
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:39,732
Hello.

721
00:55:39,793 --> 00:55:41,862
Oh, hello. How are you?

722
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:43,063
I'm good. You?

723
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:44,132
Me too.

724
00:55:45,002 --> 00:55:46,502
- Take care.
- Thank you.

725
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:48,072
Have a nice day.

726
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:50,603
(Beom, Senior Personal Trainer)

727
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:52,112
(Heon, Senior Personal Trainer)

728
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:55,913
There will be many others like her.

729
00:55:56,413 --> 00:55:57,942
Some will live alone,

730
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:00,482
hiding the fact that they're infected.

731
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:04,083
Cases will increase,

732
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:06,152
then come into the open at once.

733
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:07,652
Then why are you here?

734
00:56:08,393 --> 00:56:09,822
You need to start investigating.

735
00:56:10,663 --> 00:56:12,033
Would that help...

736
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:13,763
when there's no cure or vaccine?

737
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:16,763
Where can we keep all these people,

738
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:18,572
not knowing when they'll show symptoms?

739
00:56:19,603 --> 00:56:21,103
We can't kill them off either...

740
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:22,873
like pigs with swine flu.

741
00:56:23,873 --> 00:56:25,272
What will you do, then?

742
00:56:26,413 --> 00:56:28,712
Do you have another option?

743
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:30,842
There is...

744
00:56:32,353 --> 00:56:33,453
an option.

745
00:56:50,632 --> 00:56:53,272
(Exit)

746
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:06,453
What are you doing?

747
00:57:15,092 --> 00:57:16,922
What is going on?

748
00:57:17,822 --> 00:57:20,163
Why are you walling us in?

749
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,462
What's all this?

750
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:23,263
What are they putting up?

751
00:57:25,802 --> 00:57:27,603
Will you do something?

752
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:29,342
Are we dying?

753
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:48,293
Fortunately for us,

754
00:57:48,353 --> 00:57:50,123
only residents are allowed to use the gym,

755
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:51,763
and only half the complex is occupied.

756
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:54,132
The preschool on the grounds...

757
00:57:54,192 --> 00:57:55,502
isn't open yet either.

758
00:57:58,263 --> 00:58:00,373
You'll cordon off the whole complex?

759
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:01,902
Until we can secure...

760
00:58:01,973 --> 00:58:04,172
a place and the manpower to handle everyone.

761
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:07,143
You should inform the residents.

762
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,712
So they can be prepared.

763
00:58:10,813 --> 00:58:12,413
They won't prepare themselves.

764
00:58:13,482 --> 00:58:15,252
They'll escape and spread the disease.

765
00:58:17,482 --> 00:58:19,123
You can leave.

766
00:58:19,192 --> 00:58:23,063
Situations like this always require decisive people.

767
00:58:30,502 --> 00:58:31,563
It's my fault.

768
00:58:34,172 --> 00:58:36,902
When I found out
what you were doing in that dormitory,

769
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:40,473
I should've gone to all the papers and TV stations.

770
00:58:41,513 --> 00:58:44,283
That wouldn't have changed anything.

771
00:58:45,482 --> 00:58:47,313
We must prioritize.

772
00:58:48,112 --> 00:58:49,783
Who is more needed,

773
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:52,092
and what is more useful.

774
00:58:53,252 --> 00:58:54,993
Am I someone you need?

775
00:59:05,373 --> 00:59:07,272
I decided to live here,

776
00:59:07,703 --> 00:59:09,342
and this is my home.

777
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:13,072
Whether it's noise pollution
or mad person disease,

778
00:59:13,473 --> 00:59:14,913
running away...

779
00:59:16,013 --> 00:59:17,283
isn't my style.

780
00:59:19,353 --> 00:59:20,353
Good luck.

781
00:59:31,063 --> 00:59:32,063
Yes.

782
00:59:32,533 --> 00:59:34,663
Hey, I'm in front of your house.

783
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,902
How can I go back? I came all the way here.

784
00:59:39,873 --> 00:59:40,902
Yes.

785
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:58,283
I live in this apartment.

786
00:59:58,853 --> 01:00:00,092
Is there something wrong?

787
01:00:00,223 --> 01:00:01,692
If you enter now, you cannot come back out.

788
01:00:01,922 --> 01:00:02,922
What?

789
01:00:03,223 --> 01:00:04,563
What on earth is he talking about?

790
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:07,763
Hey, which floor are you on?

791
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:08,902
I'll go in now.

792
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:30,453
Yi Hyun.

793
01:00:31,022 --> 01:00:32,322
I'm locked inside.

794
01:00:32,993 --> 01:00:35,223
Don't try to fight your way in.

795
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:37,993
If my mom calls you, tell her I'm fine.

796
01:00:38,692 --> 01:00:39,933
What are you talking about?

797
01:00:39,993 --> 01:00:41,362
Where are you?

798
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:44,163
I will protect...

799
01:00:45,302 --> 01:00:46,533
the apartment.

800
01:00:46,603 --> 01:00:47,703
Sae Bom.

801
01:00:47,772 --> 01:00:49,402
Explain that to me again.
What do you...

802
01:00:51,172 --> 01:00:52,212
Darn it.

803
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:55,813
Well,

804
01:00:55,982 --> 01:00:57,283
I was going to tell you once I knew...

805
01:01:07,692 --> 01:01:09,293
I thought I was all alone.

806
01:01:17,962 --> 01:01:20,572
Sae Bom, I have to catch him.

807
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:22,973
It's all right.

808
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:24,902
No one can get out now.

809
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:03,783
=Happiness=

810
01:02:20,592 --> 01:02:21,592
Let me get out.

811
01:02:22,533 --> 01:02:24,263
It's very likely that you two were infected.

812
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:26,103
We don't know...

813
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:27,572
how things will change out here.

814
01:02:28,103 --> 01:02:29,603
Did you take the drug too?

815
01:02:30,743 --> 01:02:32,212
You know whom you sold them to, right?

816
01:02:32,513 --> 01:02:35,212
No one knows how people will change
when they are cornered.

817
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:37,382
What are you doing?

818
01:02:37,442 --> 01:02:38,683
We can't get out now.

819
01:02:38,743 --> 01:02:40,552
The other buildings took a vote.

820
01:02:41,482 --> 01:02:43,123
Sae Bom, are you all right?

821
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:44,583
It's blood.

822
01:02:45,752 --> 01:02:48,092
- Come out unless you want to die!
- Help me!

823
01:02:48,152 --> 01:02:50,663
It will be over in 72 hours.
