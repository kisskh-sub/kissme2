Oh Ju Hyung, you're under arrest
for murdering your wife Park Min Ji.

00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:28,358
- Let me have a word.
- Take your time.

18
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:31,767
How could you kill your wife?

Face-reading is a science.

20
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:43,208
Thank you for cooperating.

21
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,178
I believed him when he said he'd get a divorce.

22
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:47,417
But look at what happened.

23
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:51,248
Come to the police station
and give a witness statement.

24
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:53,958
You just have to tell us what you saw.

25
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:55,917
Later.

26
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,428
Right now,

27
00:01:58,357 --> 00:01:59,928
it's a bit too much.

28
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:03,327
I'll get my stuff and then leave.

29
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,027
You do that.

Hi, Sae Bom. Where are you?

32
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:34,357
I'm locked inside.

33
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:37,298
Don't try to fight your way in.

34
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,937
If my mom calls you, tell her I'm fine.

35
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:42,497
What are you talking about?
Where are you?

36
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,368
I will protect...

37
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,008
the apartment.

38
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:50,077
Sae Bom. Explain that to me again.
What do you...

39
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:52,577
Darn it.

40
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:57,988
Well, I was going to tell you
once I knew...

41
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,027
I thought I was all alone.

42
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:17,108
Sae Bom, I have to catch him.

43
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:20,877
It's all right. No one can get out now.

44
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:36,418
Who's there?

45
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:38,488
Hi. Your rice cakes are here.

46
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:42,057
Here. Enjoy it and order more again.

47
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,967
Are you a policeman too?

48
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,027
How'd you know?

49
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:48,198
Oh, you saw this?

50
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,138
I'm not a weird guy.

51
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,108
I'm your neighbour’s friend.

52
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:55,638
Oh. You have two jobs?

53
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,948
Why do you have your gun, then?

54
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:01,277
It's so I can catch bad guys and take them away.

55
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:04,287
People need to see this to know what I am.

56
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:05,587
Can I see it up close?

57
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:08,018
No, you can't. It's dangerous.

58
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:12,627
To be honest with you,
I've never used it in my life.

59
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,157
I just carry it around.

60
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,728
It looks good, doesn't it?

61
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,368
I'm home.

62
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,007
Are you dead?

63
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,777
I got back, and you won't even look at me?

64
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,148
Here's your hamburger.

65
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:33,377
What? Oh, dear.

66
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:36,216
You're getting up only
because I brought you food?

67
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:38,687
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:40,958
You said it was a hamburger.

69
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,988
It's the same thing with bread.
What's the problem?

70
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:45,888
If you don't want it, don't bother.

71
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:49,858
Honey, I didn't say I wouldn't eat it.

72
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,428
Your skin's cracking again?

73
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:52,497
No.

74
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,798
My gosh.

75
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,437
You're old. Use hand cream and lotion.

76
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,578
No, it's not because of that.

77
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:03,407
I fell yesterday and sprained my wrist.

78
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:05,078
That's nothing, then.

79
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:08,577
Honey, if someone says they got hurt,

80
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:11,088
don't you even want to know why?

81
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,858
Fine. Did something happen to you?

82
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:20,298
Yes. Yesterday, on the sixth floor.
You know...

83
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:23,228
Mom! I have a meeting!
Why didn't you wake me?

84
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:27,468
Hey. How would we know you had plans?

85
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:29,137
Are we telepathic?

86
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,868
Dong Hyun, do you want a sandwich?

87
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:34,478
You eat all you want and live long lives.

89
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,576
He's such an obnoxious kid.

90
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:42,077

00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:52,757
My gosh.

93
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:58,897
I have over 1,000 subscribers.

94
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,538
I will turn a profit at this rate.

95
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:04,007
Just cover the initial cost.

96
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,408
Don't you trust me?

97
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:09,338
Okay, fine. I'll be right there.

98
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:24,088
Who parked like this? Mister.

99
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:25,158
What's going on?

100
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,798
Darn it. What's going on?

101
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:33,228
Why are the shutters down?

102
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:34,767
Why aren't you moving?

103
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:37,408
What is the matter? I'm dead busy.

104
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:38,838
My schedule's messed up.

105
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:40,108
Oh, come on!

106
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:49,178
The small room's pretty big too.

107
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:50,247
It is.

108
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:57,627
(SY Home Cleaning)

109
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,197
Gosh, what lovely weather.

110
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:07,197
You can't smoke indoors.

111
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,267
Hey. This is called vaping.

112
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:26,858
Happy now? Yes?

113
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:28,257
All good?

114
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:31,788
Come on.

115
00:07:32,757 --> 00:07:34,057
Gosh. That jerk...

116
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,257
Honey.

117
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:37,528
Can we hire someone else?

118
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:39,598
He's so weird.

119
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:42,038
Just put up with him. Okay?

120
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:46,207
He's a gem.
He's not even asking for minimum wage.

121
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:49,877
Even his name is weird.

122
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:51,447
Andrew?

123
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:53,594
Seriously?
Does he think he's Andrew from "My Secret Identity"?

124
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:55,478
Come on. Goodness.

125
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:13,127
The sirens have been going off all morning.

126
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,338
Is there a fire?

127
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:18,238
Then we would have heard about it by now.

128
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,738
Well, I know this firsthand.

129
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,727
You can't tell there's a fire without the smell.

130
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:24,108
There was a fire in your house?

131
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,278
Yes.

132
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,817
I kept hearing the sirens from outside.

133
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,894
And there was a line of firefight trucks on the main road.

134
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,094
I wanted to find out where the fire was.

135
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,848
So I opened the window and looked around.

136
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,517
A guy in the apartment building across from mine
yelled at me.

137
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,788
- What did he say?
- "Hey, miss! Get out!"

138
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:40,258
"There's a fire in your apartment!"

139
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:43,728
There was a fire at the top unit
in my apartment building.

140
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,728
It might be really easy to see it from outside.

141
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:48,437
But you won't know if you're inside.

142
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:50,937
No way.

143
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,887
Yes. This is Attorney Kook Hae Seong.

144
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:07,057
Hello.

145
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:08,557
I live in Unit 601 across the hall.

146
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:11,887
I urgently need a consult.

147
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:15,197
I see. Hello. Gosh.

148
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,627
You must be worried about your wife.

149
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,897
I'm at home right now. Are you home now?

150
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,468
Should I visit you at your house?

151
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:26,108
No. I'm outside right now.

152
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,577
I see. Okay.

153
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:30,277
Then go ahead. What's this about?

154
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:32,907
The cops arrested me without a warrant.

155
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:35,147
Isn't arresting someone...

156
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,178
without an arrest warrant illegal?

157
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,287
What are they charging you with?

158
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:41,657
Murder.

159
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:46,228
So you fled after I arrested you. Right?

160
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:49,828
I need help! Help me!

161
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,328
I live in Building 101.

162
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,198
I'm a doctor!

163
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:54,637
- Please!
- And I'm a cop!

164
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,796
- Go ahead.
- Miss.

165
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,006
Wait. You're too old to be called that.

166
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,113
Anyway, he's your husband. Right?

167
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:01,338
I'm going to report you to the Human Rights Commission.

168
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:05,478
Don't just stand there.

169
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,067
Beat him up without making it obvious.

170
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,088
Let's just go.

171
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:14,017
- Okay.
- And put on your shoes.

172
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,458
They blocked everywhere.

173
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:22,228
- It's all blocked?
- My goodness.

174
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,674
- I can't believe this.
- What's this?

175
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,738
- This is really happening?
- I can't believe this.

176
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:30,738
What are we going to do?

177
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:32,108
This is absurd.

178
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:47,458
=Happiness=

179
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,228
=Episode 4=
I'm so disappointed.

180
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:56,397
Hey, I'm your only brother.

181
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,198
You can't lend me 150,000 dollars?

182
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,497
I have no money.

183
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:02,267
See? I know that's just a lie.

184
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:04,308
You know how much this apartment costs.

185
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:06,037
Hey.

186
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,407
You hit the jackpot.

187
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:08,684
Are they doing construction outside?

188
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,978
Or should we just move in here?

189
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:14,677
It would be great
if my kids could study in a house like this.

190
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:18,247
Hey, you have a lot of rooms here.
My kids can take a room each.

191
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:21,017
And let's be honest.
Living alone will be lonely for you.

192
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:24,088
You've heard how some people die alone, right?

193
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:25,427
Yes.

194
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:27,204
That's why I have a newspaper subscription.

195
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,757
So everyone will know once I'm dead!

196
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:32,068
Be honest with me.
You lived here with the deposit from Dad.

197
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,297
And thanks to that, you won this unit.

198
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:35,897
You got your inheritance too!

199
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:37,568
You got cash and land!

200
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,608
I got mine ten years ago.

201
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,537
- Don't you know about inflation?
- Be quiet.

202
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:44,848
Hello, residents of Building 101.

203
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:46,947
This is the resident representative from Unit 1202.

204
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:50,448
I'm sure you are confused about the noise
around the apartment.

205
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:54,787
Our apartment is completely sealed off from the outside.

206
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,617
- What?
- The authorities have something...

207
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:59,387
to tell us regarding the mad person disease.

208
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:03,797
There will be a resident meeting
in the basement gym at 5pm.

209
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:05,197
The authorities have acknowledged...

210
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,828
the existence of the mad person disease.

211
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:09,537
Along with three nursing homes and two homeless shelters,

212
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:12,708
an apartment complex in Seyang
were put into quarantine as well...

213
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,647
due to the infection of the mad person disease.

214
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,483
- Was it like that on your way in?
- As of now, the number...

215
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:18,653
- Yes.
- of quarantined facilities...

216
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:20,717
- has reached six.
- I thought it was construction.

217
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,618
To prevent any additional spread of the disease,

218
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:25,488
it was inevitable to make this decision.

219
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,988
The government assured the public
that they would hold...

220
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:31,558
diagnostic tests and devise a plan
to stop the disease from spreading.

221
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,527
I'm sure I can get out.

222
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,058
This place is nice.

223
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:44,667
My mom is inside.

224
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,507
Let me just pop in for a second.

225
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,037
- Please?
- You cannot.

226
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,188
Your mother must be worried too.

227
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:07,397
I'm sure she'll call you very soon.

228
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,127
- Mom.
- Are you all right, Seo Yoon?

229
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,397
Is everything okay inside?

230
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:13,468
Yes.

231
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,037
I'm at Unit 501.

232
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,338
I'm in front of the apartment.

233
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,167
I'll do whatever it takes to get in.
Hang in there. Okay?

234
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,777
They won't let people come out.

235
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,407
But they won't stop me from going in.

236
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,007
Okay.

237
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,677
Can you put her on if she's next to you?

238
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:39,287
Hello?

239
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,098
I'm so glad that you are with her.

240
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:45,997
Thank you so much.

241
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:49,438
I'll be there shortly.

242
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:52,438
Please watch her for a bit longer.

243
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,208
Don't worry.

244
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,938
I like spending time with Seo Yoon too.
It's fun.

245
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:58,108
Seo Yoon...

246
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:00,448
has a bad heart.

247
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:03,348
She has mitral valve regurgitation.

248
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,017
Blood tends to pool in her heart.

249
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:08,017
She cannot exercise rigorously.

250
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:09,718
And she cannot bleed.

251
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:12,328
Just the other day, she hurt her nail.

252
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,534
She had to get admitted to the hospital
and get antibiotics.

253
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:15,997
I'll keep a close eye on her.

254
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:18,598
I left her alone. For what? For some money?
I should've stayed.

255
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,188
I couldn't pick up the phone
when she called earlier.

256
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,568
I'll try to see
if there's a way to get her out of here.

257
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,208
Thank you so much.

258
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:31,708
Gosh. It's not your fault.

259
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:34,777
Don't worry too much.
I'll take good care of her.

260
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:36,277
Okay.

261
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:53,728
Mom.

262
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:56,637
Can I eat the rice cakes?

263
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:08,177
(Ms. Kim Bok Nam)

264
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,517
Yes, Mom?

265
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:13,688
You said you were fine.
What happened?

266
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:16,318
Your apartment complex got cordoned off. Right?

267
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:18,558
They are taking action to prevent the spread.

268
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,828
So don't worry.

269
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:22,157
I heard a lot of people got infected.
So stay home.

270
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:23,868
Don't do anything.

271
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,698
I would like that too, but...

272
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,767
But we cannot just do nothing.

273
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:35,708
- What?
- I'm busy. I'll call you later.

274
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,208
(Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok)

275
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:44,618
Mr. Han?

276
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:46,287
Let's meet.

277
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:48,618
When do you think?

278
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:49,858
As soon as possible.

279
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,334
You knew
that Ms. Park Min Ji was taking the drug, right?

280
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:56,797
Did you take the same drug too?

281
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:00,667
Was that...

282
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:02,838
because of the drug?

283
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,708
Well, you can't run now.

284
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,407
Just stay here.

285
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:10,137
Right.

286
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,457
If you want to consult with a lawyer,
go for it.

287
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:17,298
Do I have to stay here too?

288
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,218
But I don't live here.

289
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:22,058
No one can get in or out.

290
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:26,287
But you're a cop.
Can you find me a way?

291
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:27,897
Even I can't get out of here.

292
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,728
There's a resident meeting.
You can attend it with me.

293
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:34,938
No.

294
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,344
Everyone must have heard
what happened by now.

295
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:39,238
What would they think of me?

296
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:42,078
Then you're going to stay here
with Mr. Oh Ju Hyung?

297
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:52,218
Hold on.

298
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,438
What is it this time?

299
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,108
I'm worried about Ms. Woo.

300
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:20,677
I'll uncuff you later, so take a nap.

301
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:23,877
What are you doing right now?

302
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,547
Why are you doing this to me?

303
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,917
What about the bathroom?

304
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:29,517
How am I...

305
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:31,927
Should I just go in my room?

306
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:39,897
Don't miss.

307
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,438
Darn it!

308
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:47,838
Darn it!

309
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:54,728
You're really going to stay?

310
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:57,278
Of course, I want to go.

311
00:17:57,518 --> 00:17:59,487
But you know how sensitive I am.

312
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,417
With mad person disease going around,

313
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,047
if I go to places with a lot of people,

314
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,957
I can't be at 100 percent.

315
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:09,457
Then what about me?
Do you think I'm not scared?

316
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:11,998
That's why I trust in you wholeheartedly.

317
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:14,967
On days like today,
clients will line up to talk to me.

318
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,008
This lock down can cause a lot of legal issues.

319
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,877
I get it. I'll try to bring in as much business as I can.

320
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,578
- So Yoon.
- Yes?

321
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:26,348
Good luck!

322
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:35,818
Hello.

323
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:40,457
I heard you arrested the man
who lives across the hall.

324
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,558
Where is he right now?

325
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:45,368
He's in his apartment.

326
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,538
Because of the lock down.

327
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:51,359
He has been handcuffed,
so if your husband was to give him a consult,

328
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:52,637
tell him he can go in.

329
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:54,707
Do you...

330
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,308
have evidence of murder?

331
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,808
You should ask Oh Ju Hyung yourself.

332
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:02,278
But if I were you guys,

333
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:05,088
I wouldn't represent him.

334
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:15,397
Sang Hee, are you outside?

335
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:18,028
Sang Hee, let's talk. Please.

336
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:20,427
You and I are on the same boat right now!

337
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,667
No.

338
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,508
Hey. Do you think you'd be able
to live happily without me?

339
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:28,508
Everyone knows I had an affair with you,

340
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:30,784
and you won't even be able to leave
since you're stuck here.

341
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:32,984
You don't have any money,
and you'll get fired from the clinic.

342
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,877
The only person who can understand you...

343
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,147
is me, Sang Hee.

344
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,318
You know me.

345
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:41,088
Right?

346
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,927
Sang Hee. I'll give you money. Okay?

347
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,498
Sang Hee?

348
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,268
How much are you willing to give me?

349
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,808
(Congratulations on your move!)

350
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:08,647
Hello.

351
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:11,447
I live in Building 602,
and I'm Attorney Kook Hae Seong's wife.

352
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:13,487
If any of you have any legal issues,

353
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,088
please call us at this number.

354
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:19,358
They don't know anything about drugs.

355
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,897
He got angry at me and said...

356
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,258
he doesn't take steroids.

357
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:37,827
Is our building the only ones coming here today?

358
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:40,008
Just Units 1 and 2 on each floor.

359
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,167
I think everyone else is meeting separately.

360
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,498
Dear respected residents
of Seyang Forest Le Ciel Apartment.

361
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:01,298
Because of the possibility of additional infections,

362
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:04,967
we have decided on cohort isolation for a week.

363
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,538
Excuse me, miss!

364
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,608
I don't even live here.
Am I still stuck here?

365
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:12,548
We will be sure to reimburse you
for any losses you have suffered...

366
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,008
for being unable to leave...

367
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:15,876
while we work on doing a complete enumeration.

368
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:16,877
That's not the problem.

369
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:19,294
We will make sure to provide you
with everything that you need...

370
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:20,618
including meals.

371
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,387
Please be patient with us.

372
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,627
If there is anything you need in the future,

373
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:26,358
please discuss it among yourselves...

374
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:28,427
and let us know. That is all.

375
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:30,828
- No, that won't do. Excuse me!
- What?

376
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:32,268
- That's...
- Is she serious?

377
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:35,137
- Miss! Wait!
- We are stuck here?

378
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:37,098
You must all be surprised,

379
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:39,844
but I believe the residents
of Seyang Forest Le Ciel Apartment...

380
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:43,008
can overcome this trial calmly.

381
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:44,977
- That's not the issue here!
- Calmly?

382
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:48,477
Please. If you all talk over each other,
I can't hear you.

383
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:51,088
I'll give you each a turn to speak.

384
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:55,487
Is this because someone was infected here yesterday?

385
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:58,588
Then they should quarantine the people
who had contact with her.

386
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:01,427
I've never even seen that woman.

387
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:05,498
Your wife...

388
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,538
bumped into the lady from Unit 601 and fell.

389
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:09,998
She didn't tell you?

390
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:11,068
Really?

391
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,108
I guess you guys don't talk to each other a lot.

392
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:18,048
If this is a contagious disease,

393
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:20,054
isn't it bad for us to be gathered around like this?

394
00:22:20,078 --> 00:22:21,248
Didn't you see it on TV?

395
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:24,147
It isn't spread through the air,
so don't worry about it.

396
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,788
- What should we...
- But...

397
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:28,387
what if one of us is infected...

398
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:30,457
and suddenly attacks and tries to bite us?

399
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,828
Since we're all in this small space together,

400
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:36,998
we'll all end up tearing...

401
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:38,103
- each other apart.
- My head hurts.

402
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,967
To be honest, I don't think...

403
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,798
anyone else here is infected.

404
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,868
Everyone here is sophisticated.

405
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:49,477
Luckily, we have some detectives here too.

406
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:51,177
Detectives?

407
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:55,748
Don't look at me. It's suffocating.
You should go up.

408
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:05,088
Some unique behaviours are present
before the disease develops.

409
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:07,328
They get extremely thirsty,

410
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,998
and the irises of their eyes get small,

411
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,498
- and their eyes turn white.
- What?

412
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:14,028
They also partake in compulsive behaviours such as...

413
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:15,798
knocking on the walls
when they're alone.

414
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:18,297
When you meet someone,
try to meet in groups of two or more.

415
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:21,578
Always keep your doors open
when you interact.

416
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:25,207
If you see suspicious behaviour,
ask for help right away.

417
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,278
I live alone,

418
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,794
so how can be in a group of two or more?

419
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:28,977
- Hold on.
- It's a week.

420
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:32,717
You just need to be patient...

421
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:34,917
for one week.

422
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:03,778
You did the lock down
when kids were at school,

423
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,788
and you stopped the school buses from coming in.

424
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:09,788
You wanted to do the lock down
without any kids here, right?

425
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:12,028
That looks better.

426
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:14,917
There's a kid who didn't go to school today.

427
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:16,258
Let her go out.

428
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,667
You can do that, can't you?

429
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:20,927
Park Seo Yoon.

430
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:22,897
Her parents are getting tested.

431
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,927
There's a high chance
that they've been infected.

432
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:28,207
Are you sure?

433
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,484
Delivering packages is hard,
so he probably took the drug...

434
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:31,877
to help wake himself up.

435
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:34,348
They called their kid and said,

436
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:36,778
"I love you. I miss you." Am I right?

437
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:39,348
It's all meaningless.

438
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:40,916
You don't know...

439
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:43,237
how a person will transform
when they're pressed for time.

440
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:45,558
Lieutenant Colonel Han.

441
00:24:46,328 --> 00:24:49,528
You can talk about your negative ideas
on family during blind dates.

442
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:51,568
What do you want me to do?

443
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:57,907
I'm saying she's safer here with a good guardian.

444
00:24:58,707 --> 00:24:59,707
You don't know...

445
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:05,677
how things will change outside.

446
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,487
Excuse me, officer.

447
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:14,717
The walls outside...

448
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:17,678
If someone tried hard enough,
they might be able to get over it.

449
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,558
If someone were to get over it,

450
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:20,758
will they be punished?

451
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:22,896
I don't know about that,

452
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,328
but the reporters outside would have a field day with it.

453
00:25:26,197 --> 00:25:28,677
If you're lucky,
you might even make it on the 9 o'clock news.

454
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:30,737
- I see.
- What about food?

455
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:34,778
Should we all eat by ourselves?

456
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:37,437
We'll give you meals starting tomorrow morning.

457
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:39,207
You have food for dinner tonight, right?

458
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:40,348
Well...

459
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,977
Where is everyone from the management office?

460
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:45,187
The apartment went into lock down at 9:30am,

461
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:47,348
but nobody came into work before then.

462
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,717
The person on duty is at another building's meeting.

463
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:51,588
It's ridiculous.

464
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:53,088
What?

465
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:57,397
So the other buildings are having a meeting without us?

466
00:25:57,457 --> 00:26:00,227
They're afraid of us
because our building had the first case.

467
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:02,768
They have failed to fulfill their duties.

468
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:06,368
So nobody from the management office is here right now?

469
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:13,177
No, I guess not.

470
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,778
Something we cannot overlook has happened.

471
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:18,318
There's someone outside.

472
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:25,858
My husband and I were living in the States,

473
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:28,798
and we were impressed
by Korea's disease prevention and came back.

474
00:26:28,858 --> 00:26:30,258
Excuse me, ma'am.

475
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:33,298
Someone from the management office
is right outside.

476
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:40,568
Aside from this,
there is a lot of corruption in our apartment.

477
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:42,278
Did you know that...

478
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:44,824
they secretly fixed the elevators
when there was an inspection?

479
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:47,608
They only collect the recycling once a week.

480
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:50,618
Did you know they're spending more money
on maintaining the trees?

481
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:52,848
If you trust and follow me,

482
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:56,358
I will become the representative
for the entire apartment,

483
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,457
and I will actively resolve...

484
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:01,088
all the issues of our apartments.

485
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,427
Let the rental units use the gym too.

486
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,767
My husband studied theology in Kentucky.

487
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:13,008
- I want to work out.
- Because we're on lock down,

488
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:15,907
many of you must be wondering
how to attend church.

489
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,078
Hallelujah.

490
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:23,147
- The Lord is always with you.
- Amen.

491
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:25,487
You who believe...

492
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:27,687
can come to me.

493
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:33,157
If you have any difficulties calculating your losses,

494
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:36,227
or if you need any legal advice,
you can come to me.

495
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:39,368
We offer high-quality legal services.

496
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:40,967
Come to Unit 602.

497
00:27:42,137 --> 00:27:43,298
Let's go.

498
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,568
Come along.

499
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:46,538
How annoying.

500
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:57,118
I heard you're something like a police officer.

501
00:27:57,947 --> 00:28:00,647
I need you to cooperate
and keep things in order.

502
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,788
I'm in a different field.

503
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:05,157
I only learned how to fight terrorism.

504
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:07,927
If you need cooperation, talk to me.

505
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,790
Do I get paid extra?

506
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,259
I doubt it.

507
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,060
I'm sure it'll help me get promoted.

508
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:27,330
I didn't come here
knowing what would happen.

509
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,499
I want to go home and help deliver rice cakes.

510
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,939
What is going on here?

511
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,570
You need to tell me if
I'm to tell you anything.

512
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,509
- Why lock...
- Let me ask you something.

513
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,110
Do you know this guy well?

514
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,279
Ju Heon?

515
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,749
No. I work every other day,
so I almost never see him.

516
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:50,019
He missed the last few days of work,

517
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,360
so I've been filling in.

518
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,199
You're drinking way too much water.

519
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,370
Do you feel thirsty all the time?

520
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:06,100
I usually drink lots of water.

521
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,640
Can you open this?

522
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:10,540
I'm SOU.

523
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,709
Okay.

524
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:15,850
Take a look.

525
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,749
The guy you worked with...

526
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:24,689
sold drugs here.

527
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:26,759
The government thinks...

528
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,130
that drug causes mad person disease.

529
00:29:30,189 --> 00:29:31,429
You know the symptoms, right?

530
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,759
Extreme thirst.

531
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,870
Hallucinations.

532
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:42,810
Tell the truth.

533
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,969
Did you take any?

534
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,439
No. I really didn't take anything other than supplements.

535
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,370
You know who bought them though, right?

536
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,519
If you don't tell us now,

537
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,249
you could be charged with distribution too.

538
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,419
I really don't know anything.

539
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:01,729
Lying won't get you anywhere.

540
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,830
Do you even know
you people are the reason for the lock down?

541
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,229
It's not like that!

542
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,509
Well, you two kept cornering me,
making me look like the bad guy.

543
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,580
I really did not take such drugs.

544
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,449
It's true.

545
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,759
We have a full schedule for the week.

546
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,070
Do you think you can help us out?

547
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,499
Sir, I came here totally unplanned,

548
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,800
and I'm stuck too.

549
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,640
They said they would compensate for any losses,

550
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:51,739
so let's wait and see.

551
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,050
Do you two...

552
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,810
have a place to stay?

553
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,320
No, we don't.

554
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,419
We even have a child at home.

555
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,050
How old is your child?

556
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,219
Seventeen.

557
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,320
Oh, 17...

558
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,689
I'll see if they'll let you sleep in...

559
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,300
the unit you were cleaning.

560
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,070
Is that person with you?

561
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,429
Oh, well, he's our employee.

562
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:19,640
- He...
- What's your name?

563
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:22,509
I'm Andrew.

564
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,969
Pardon?

565
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,310
Excuse me. Just a moment.

566
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,519
That kid is a bit slow,

567
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,850
but he's sweet.

568
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,360
He hurt his face as a kid and has a huge scar.

569
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:41,729
He stayed at home all the time,

570
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:45,060
but these days,
people don't mind if you wear a mask,

571
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:47,830
so he plucked up the courage to work.

572
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,229
Okay.

573
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:52,839
Do you all have your ID cards?

574
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,600
- Yes.
- Let's see them.

575
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,739
They need a list of the people inside.

Ahn Guk Jin.

579
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:17,390
Why did you say your name is Andrew?

580
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,459
Because...

581
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:22,400
I wish I had superpowers.

582
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
There was a drama about that.

No, it's...

Who were you talking to
that you hung up so hurriedly?

586
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,650
I was just talking to a friend.

587
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,790
- Shall we tie him up?
- We're not sure yet.

588
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:45,519
We won't tie you up.

589
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,419
Just stay here, okay?

590

Mr. Kim.

591
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:51,160
If we catch you outside,

592
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:53,860
then we'll assume you're infected.

593
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,100
Let's see...

594
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,560
if you can go without water all night.

(Do not enter. Risk of infection!)

596

Still, I'm glad...

600
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:30,830
they didn't let everyone use the gym.

601
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:33,070
A suspected victim died.

a cop.

You bet.

605
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,019
I did go to the gym a few times,

606
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,050
but other than that, I stayed at home.

607
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,689
I won't leave until lock down’s called off,

608
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:50,820
so don't mind me.

609
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,419
I'm here for something else.

610

657
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,839
No, she didn't.

658
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,469
I bet she did.

659
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,379
No. My goodness.

660
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,179
What are you doing?

661
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:37,750
I told you she didn't.

662
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:41,750
Goodness. You never bought me any medicine.

663
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:46,060
Oh, boy. That's nothing.

664
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,529
This is what's turning you into a couch potato?
Gosh.

665
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:49,989
Come and drink some soju.

666
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,560
It won't hurt once you drink.

667
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:52,960
Gosh.

668
00:37:58,469 --> 00:37:59,540
Who is it?

669
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,969
Is your son home?

670
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,940
I saw him go out earlier.

671
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:04,370
Do you know where he is?

672
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,009
He must be somewhere in the apartment.

673
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,779
Anyway, he's not here.

674
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:12,079
I know where he is.

675
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,549
I told you, didn't I?
I'm not talking about stocks today.

676
00:38:15,649 --> 00:38:17,569
Why?
Because I'll show you something real today.

677
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,620
Goodness. It's nice to see you.

678
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,190
You're such a generous viewer.
It's great to see you.

679
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,330
All right.
Everyone, do you know where I am?

680
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,898
This is the unit where the first infected lived.

681
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:33,646
(The apartment price will plummet with that now.)

682
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,839
I hear that her family still lives here.

683
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,580
I plan to meet with them and talk.

684
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,449
Should I ring the bell? Yes?

685
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,149
Should I ring it or not?

686
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,620
Ring it or not?

687
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,160
Should I ring it or not?

688
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,520
Do it? Or don't do it?

689
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:57,089
Should I punch him or not?

690
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,129
Should I? Or should I not?

691
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,660
Should I or not?

692
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,670
I hit the jackpot.

693
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,870
I'll turn this off.
Just wash up and go to sleep now.

694
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,339
How do I turn this off?

695
00:39:07,899 --> 00:39:10,410
- Peace out.
- What was that?

696
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,339
Thank you.

697
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,279
Why is he thanking us?

698
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,679
- I got 500 dollars.
- This is crazy.

699
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,219
- Gosh.
- Why did you do that?

700
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,390
Hey, come here.

701
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:30,629
Gosh. This was another long day.

702
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,000
Right.

703
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:34,939
What about the manager
from the dermatology clinic?

704
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,010
She's siding with Oh Ju Hyung.
She's going to stay with him there.

705
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:39,440
I see.

706
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,815
Should I go upstairs
and try to persuade her again?

707
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,369
No, don't. She's a grown woman.

708
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,870
She has to make her own decisions.

709
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,879
I doubt that Oh Ju Hyung
will do anything stupid now of all times.

710
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,679
Let's just check up on her to see if she's doing okay.

711
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,710
I'm beat.

712
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Let's do that.

713
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:55,719
What about our sleeping arrangement?

714
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,449
Where will we...

715
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,259
Where will I sleep?

716
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,420
Gosh.

717
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,089
Hey. Smile.

718
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:39,560
All right. In 1, 2.

719
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,199
What are you doing?

720
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,569
My wife wants me to send her some photos.

721
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,199
She asked if I went fishing.

722
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,270
She never believes anything I say.

723
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,980
I can't believe this either.

724
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
What?

725
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,910
That I have to sleep here with you.

726
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,679
Gosh. Things were going well today.

727
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:02,949
There.

728
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,750
Here.

729
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,450
We just have to keep this up for a few days.

730
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,460
Pretend that you're chilling
at a vacation house. Okay?

731
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:11,529
Okay.

732
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,080
Are you praying?

733
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:30,779
I prayed for something else today.

734
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,179
I prayed
that there would be no more lock down tomorrow.

735
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,750
Okay. I'll pray for that too.

736
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,759
- Sweet dreams.
- Okay.

737
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,390
Goodnight.

738
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,830
Goodnight.

739
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,100
Yi Hyun.

740
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:52,969
What?

741
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,569
I have a bad back.

742
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
All of a sudden?

743
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,410
Yes.

744
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:06,449
Gosh. You can sleep on the sofa.

745
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Thanks.

746
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,390
This is mine. Take yours.

747
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,989
Okay. Thanks.

748
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,600
I had a quack for my Korean medicine doctor.

749

(You must have a lot on your mind.
Sorry for constantly calling you.)

751
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,936
(Congratulations on your marriage.
Everything will be great.)

752
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,835
(Don't worry too much.
And take care of your health.)

753
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,730
(Don't live like me.)

754
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,759
(I hope you can be happy.)

755
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:09,549
(You too, Mom. Live a happy life too.)

Jung Guk.

760
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,199
I know you're not sleeping.

761
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:32,339
- What?
- Han Tae Seok's assault case.

762
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,886
What happened to the chairman
of the pharmaceutical company?

763
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,239
What are you talking about?

764
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,379
It was an assault case,
so he couldn't have died.

765
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:45,179
I'm just wondering
what he's been up to afterwards.

766
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,679
(Report on Trends)

767
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,620
You seem much better, sir.

768
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:20,996
You acknowledged the mad person disease...

769
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,489
and sealed off the apartment.

770
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:24,625
The international press is all over this too.

771
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:25,866
New articles will be published tomorrow.

772
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,450
And they'll close the borders tomorrow.

773
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,129
You said you could take care of this quietly.

774
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,999
So I made a recommendation to the higher-ups.

775
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,399
They must all be very disappointed.

776
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,040
Someone had been distributing Next.

777
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,540
Hence, our failed attempt.

778
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,270
Who?

779
00:44:49,379 --> 00:44:50,410
You, sir.

780
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,949
You were the one...

781
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,940
who took out all the drugs in the storage. Right?

782
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:57,790
I didn't buy them.

783
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:00,120
Someone told me where the storage was...

784
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,259
and to take all of the drugs in there.

785
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,390
Why would I do that?

786
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:07,330
More people must get infected...

787
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:09,170
for the medicine to get developed faster.

788
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:12,500
And you would rather want the world to collapse...

789
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:14,739
than you dying from this disease.

790

Did you know
that your wife's blood tasted the best?

795
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:46,500
It must be hard...

It's okay.

The old man was behind the distribution.

800
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:39,396
I'll make a list of all his close acquaintances,
so look into it.

801
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,460
We have to block off all channels to the infection.

802
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,390
Can we leave him like that?

803
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:46,199
What should we do then?

804
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:48,206
We should quarantine him like the other patients.

805
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,830
He's too powerful for us to do that.

806
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:52,789
Once we come up with a cure,
we're going to stop him first.

807
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,770
Even if he gets cured, he might still attack people.

808
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,839
He got a taste of blood...

809
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:00,839
and realized nothing bad has happened.

810
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,080
That's more reason to...

811
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,649
The cure is most important.

812
00:47:07,379 --> 00:47:08,949
How we'll survive after...

813
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,479
is a whole different subject.

814
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,580
Nothing has changed.

815
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:36,609
This afternoon, government authorities have put...

816
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,750
two more nursing hospitals in cohort isolation.

817
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:41,779
As a result, one apartment complex,

818
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,089
three nursing hospitals,

819
00:47:43,149 --> 00:47:45,350
and two homeless shelters have been locked down.

820
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,219
That makes it a total of 8 areas in lock down
in a matter of 2 days.

821
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,100
People suspect that mad person disease
has spread abroad as well.

822
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,069
Russia has closed its borders
due to the infectious disease.

823
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:57,429
Not only do they...

824
00:47:58,529 --> 00:47:59,670
Did you sleep well?

825
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,170
Of course.

826
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,640
Did you sleep well too?

827
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:04,210
Yes.

828
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,679
- Let's go.
- Where?

829
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:09,879
Our meals are here.

830
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:11,910
- Oh, right.
- Good morning.

831
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,549
- You're up already?
- Yes.

832
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,980
- Hello.
- Did you sleep well?

833
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:16,219
Yes.

834
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:18,350
Sae Bom,

835
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,160
you're in a good mood today.

836
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,790
Yi Hyun tossed and turned all night.

837
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:25,910
What are you talking about?

838
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,129
People...

839
00:48:28,759 --> 00:48:29,969
become happy when they have...

840
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:31,730
something to get excited over.

841
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:32,879
What are you talking about?

842
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,940
Aren't you curious about the food
they'll give us?

843
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:37,569
I am.

844
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:40,109
Why?

845
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:43,549
I paid money to buy an apartment here,

846
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:45,109
so why can't I leave?

847
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,549
Open the door.

848
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,179
Grandpa.

849
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,250
You're in a rental apartment.

850
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:52,920
You moved in with my taxes.

851
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,330
Am I not a resident
because I live in a rental?

852
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,660
Why you little...

853
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,476
It's the management office employee
and the other building residents.

854
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,529
What do they want?

855
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,929
They said we couldn't leave anymore.

856
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,699
The other buildings voted on it.

857
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:07,770
Lock it up.

858
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,410
What are you doing?

859
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,310
All of this is because someone from this building
was infected.

860
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:18,179
I heard that...

861
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,830
you guys locked someone
who was infected in the gym.

862
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,319
How did you know that?

863
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,750
We can see everything
from the management office.

864
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,620
So are you saying
you were watching our building?

865
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:31,629
For the sake of our entire apartment,

866
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,160
the people in Units 1 and 2
should stay at home for a week...

867
00:49:35,129 --> 00:49:36,609
No, just don't leave your apartments.

868
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,540
What about our meals?

869
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,770
We'll bring you the necessities.

870
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:44,810
We're all struggling, so don't be like this.

871
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:47,210
It's not like it's an airborne disease.

872
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:51,009
Units 1 and 2 of this building
have the most rentals, right?

873
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,109
I believe so.

874
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:54,279
What does that matter?

875
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:57,149
I'm saying this is unfair for us!

876
00:49:57,219 --> 00:49:59,496
If the price of our apartment falls
because more people get infected,

877
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,819
- we end up suffering the most!
- That's right.

878
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:05,829
You are doing this on purpose
since you can live here for ten years...

879
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:08,600
and then buy it for cheap!

880
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,600
Jung Guk. Can you help us out?

881
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:15,339
I can't even stand up to my wife.

882
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,870
If they don't want us to leave,
let's not leave.

883
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:20,839
Not that. Let me borrow your gun.

884
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:29,609
Should I shoot this door open,
or do you want to open it for us?

885
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,960
Unlock it.

886
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,390
Seo Yoon.
Don't learn that kind of behaviour from her.

887
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,660
She's so cool.

888
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,879
I'm getting more disappointed in humanity every day.

889
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,730
You just need to bear with it for six more days.

890
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,949
Time is passing by slower than
when we were training.

891
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:12,051
You're being too harsh.

892
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:15,641
We tried to put extra care in the meals instead.

893
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:17,750
There's a lot of protein.

894
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:21,541
(Infectious Disease Emergency Relief Goods)

895
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:26,701
What about the other buildings?
Is this everything?

896
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,101
They want to get theirs later.

897
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:29,921
After the people in Units 1 and 2 go inside.

898
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:34,101
At times they're courageous,
and at times they're cowards.

899
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,710
Humans are so hard to understand.

900
00:51:37,871 --> 00:51:39,241
Did you prepare a lot?

901
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:41,781
We'll take this inside.

902
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:45,621
Go wait inside.

903
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:47,621
Let's go, Seo Yoon.

904
00:51:50,321 --> 00:51:51,590
Do you need anything else?

905
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:53,821
Then...

906
00:51:54,721 --> 00:51:56,891
How about a T-shirt? A men's large.

907
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:59,500
Something that looks special.

908
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,761
One with the Special Forces mark on it.

909
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,670
You don't have SOU T-shirts, right?

910
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,940
Are you the only one here?

911
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:14,511
Yes. The lock down happened
when my boss and his wife went to get stock.

912
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:17,961
You don't have much of anything.

913
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,427
The other buildings came
and bought out everything last night.

914
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,321
A few people from Building 101 came by too.

915
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,920
This is a bad situation,

916
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,590
but you seem pretty calm.

917
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,041
I agreed to get paid three times my hourly pay.

918
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:31,661
I'm working 12 hours a day...

919
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,570
and with the holiday pay, it's a lot of money.

920
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,101
Aren't you scared to be alone?

921
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,471
They probably go crazy at home.

922
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,060
They wouldn't come to the supermarket.

923
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,340
If we run out of goods, I could just lock up.

924
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,620
You didn't bring any packages?

925
00:52:54,121 --> 00:52:56,520
I have a package that I need today.

926
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:57,650
Have a good day.

927
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,831
I don't eat meat.

928
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,790
You don't have a vegetarian meal?

929
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:06,630
- Oh, vegetarian?
- Yes.

930
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:08,661
Just eat what they give you.

931
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,940
This is authentic.

932
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,641
I know someone who works there.

933
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,880
I'll get you an SOU T-shirt
as soon as the lock down ends.

934
00:53:25,821 --> 00:53:26,980
I like it.

935
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:28,121
Right?

936
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:31,851
Have you...

937
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,261
been to the roof?

938
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:41,400
- Isn't it nice to come outside?
- Yes.

939
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:01,721
I feel a bit better being out in an open area.

940
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,451
It feels like we're on a trip.

941
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,321
It does.

942
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,520
Let's stay like this for a bit.

943
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,571
This looks good.

944
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:30,551
Thank you for the food.

945
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,850
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

946
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,221
Eat up, Seo Yoon.

947
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,321
This is pretty good for emergency relief goods.

948
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:37,590
- It really is.
- Right.

949
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,790
Have some more.

950
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,190
Thank you.

951
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,860
- Have some of this.
- Thanks.

952
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:48,801
Seo Yoon. Eat up too.

953
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:51,931
What?

954
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,601
We have three packed meals left.

955
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:31,141
Are you sure everyone got one?

956
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,741
Yes. Even the cleaning lady took hers.

957
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,250
Oh, right.

958
00:55:39,181 --> 00:55:40,181
The gym guy.

959
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,351
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

960
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,491
You could've called if you're hungry...

961
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:54,331
He must've gotten out.

962
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,940
(Congratulations on moving in.)

963
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,190
- Hello?
- The gym guy.

964
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,991
A suspected carrier got out.

965
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:20,891
Put out a broadcast telling people to go home.

966
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:24,460
I meant to call to tell you this.

967
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,661
The management office people aren't picking up.

968
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,560
I think they're upset about earlier.

969
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,170
They're holding another meeting without us.

970
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,371
I'll call them, then.

971
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:34,000
Hello? I...

972
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,141
Does this punk think he's above me?

973
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,210
He's just a ninth-grade civil servant.

974
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,581
(Emergency Network)

975
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:50,150
(Congratulations on moving in.)

976
00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:57,230
Where are you going?

977
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:04,270
They're not picking up.

978
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:05,801
Where are you going?

979
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,110
He has to be hiding here.

980
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:28,360
Invalid card.

981
00:57:43,641 --> 00:57:44,641
Let's go.

982
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:57,391
No?

983
00:57:57,621 --> 00:57:58,621
No.

984
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:03,491
What's that?

985
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:10,301
Hey.

986
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:15,871
It's blood.

987
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:28,721
Let's go.

988
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:30,920
- Let's see what's going on.
- Sae Bom.

989
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:33,221
I don't want to be scared
when I don't know anything.

990
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,690
Mister! Get out of there!

991
00:59:13,161 --> 00:59:14,230
Shouldn't we go?

992
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,101
Get out unless you want to die!

993
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:17,630
Shoot.

994
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,241
- Try again.
- Why won't it work?

995
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,351
Try again.

996
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:35,721
Thank you.

997
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:48,761
Why...

998
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,071
What's this about?

999
00:59:52,031 --> 00:59:54,201
I only went out to my car.

1000
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:55,900
I really didn't drink any water.

1001
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,071
Then why did you run?

1002
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,310
Because you two were running.

1003
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:00,781
Will you let go of me?

1004
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:02,610
Come on.

1005
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,681
My gosh.

1006
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,420
Do you see anything?

1007
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:09,321
See what?
Is there something out there?

1008
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,661
What a mess.

1009
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:24,130
Let's go upstairs.

1010
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,810
Help me! Please help me.

1011
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:41,241
My gosh.

1012
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,250
Ma'am! Are you all right?

1013
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:47,121
I'm fine but that couple...

1014
01:01:56,831 --> 01:01:59,801
Mom. I'm doing well.

1015
01:02:01,031 --> 01:02:03,431
(Unread)

1016
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,991
(Read)

1017
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:36,400
(I love you, Seo Yoon.)

1018
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,210
Hey.

1019
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,540
This is our opportunity.

1020
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,380
Hyun Kyung will have a lot on her mind too.

1021
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:54,451
Let's be strong, okay?

1022
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:58,250
We have just two months to find a new place.

1023
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:00,891
We can't live in a studio apartment with the kids.

1024
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:02,621
It's too cramped.

1025
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,891
You can't go outside.

1026
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Stay back.

1027
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:16,440
Stay here. Don't run off again.

1028
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,411
What are you doing?

1029
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,310
Is something wrong?

1030
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,380
Be quiet.

1031
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:34,590
(Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok)

1032
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:42,360
Ms. Yoon, are you all right?

1033
01:03:44,201 --> 01:03:46,670
Now do you see why we had to block you in?

1034
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,420
What... What is...

1035
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:22,270
The other buildings are overrun.

1036
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:23,710
I see that.

1037
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:58,110
=Happiness=

1038
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,820
Don't hesitate to shoot if you're in danger.

1039
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,960
Don't open the door. Block it.

1040
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:20,031
That makes no sense.

1041
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:21,512
How can they all be infected already?

1042
01:05:21,931 --> 01:05:24,230
What if this doesn't get resolved even after a week?

1043
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,301
We need as much food as possible.

1044
01:05:26,331 --> 01:05:27,371
This is crazy.

1045
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,586
We just have to keep the couple from downstairs...

1046
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,940
from talking.

1047
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,641
Are you thirsty?

1048
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,581
You can't let them pity the infected.

1049
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:37,987
Instil fear, so they want to stay away.

1050
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:39,411
Open the door!

1051
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:41,081
If you're a decent human being,

1052
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:43,290
at least feel somewhat responsible.
