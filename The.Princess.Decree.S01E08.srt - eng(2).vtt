00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.120
General Gan, what does this mean?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.990
The Vice Minister of Revenue position
has been vacant for long.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.680
I

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
have found a suitable candidate.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.640
What do you

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.480
think?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.680
Vice Minister Wang.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.920
You couldn't fit in
among the civil ministers

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.159
and quickly found a new patron.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.960
How clever.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.199
A wise man adapts to the times.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.000
You flatter me.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.159
It's a pity

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.680
that I don't like him.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.400
Why?

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.719
He offended me.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.199
Didn't you know?

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.280
Please calm down.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.319
Please calm down.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.199
Just because he insulted Li Yuanze?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.000
I won't let anyone,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.879
even ordinary people,

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.719
question my things.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.759
You know this feeling

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.919
better than anyone.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:55.599
Right?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.599
But

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.000
Li Yuanze is no ordinary man.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.400
You let this beast out of the cage

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.759
and ruined my plans.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.280
Shouldn't you compensate me?

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.400
If not for your scheme to sow discord,

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.159
he wouldn't have emerged so fast.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.039
What do you really want?

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.280
From the beginning,

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.000
all I want

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.919
is your support.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.560
After all,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.840
we are on the same path.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.479
Don't you agree?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.240
Regarding the promotion
of Vice Minister Wang

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.120
to Minister of Revenue,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.759
what are the ministers' opinions?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Your Majesty.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.480
Vice Minister Wang has no experience

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.040
and may not even understand

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.079
taxes or accounts.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.319
How can someone who only seeks pleasure

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:39.160
bear such a burden?

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.439
Once appointed,

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.199
it's chaos at best, and state affairs
will be delayed at worst.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.399
Meanwhile, Official Lin has served
in Ministry of Revenue for years

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.120
without a single mistake.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.680
(Xiao Pingzhao, Emperor of Jing)
Clearly, he should take the post.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.519
Experience can always be gained.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.879
Official Zhang.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.920
Were you born

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.879
already knowing Confucian classics?

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.480
Absurd.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.360
In my opinion,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.399
Vice Minister Wang

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.399
is the most suitable candidate
for Minister of Revenue.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.399
General Gan, you're wrong.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.160
Civil officials' posts

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.600
cannot be arranged by generals.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.480
That's right.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.519
It's not up to them.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.319
Ridiculous.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.360
Is that so?

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.600
Official Li.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.040
What if I insist on intervening?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.199
General Gan is thoughtful.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.040
In my opinion,

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:00.279
Vice Minister Wang
is an excellent choice.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.680
Official Lin
knows Ministry of Revenue well,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.160
but he's old.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.199
The Jing court needs new vigor.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.160
Princess Royal is wise.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.660
- Princess Royal is wise.
- Princess Royal is wise.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.959
Official Li, what do you think?

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.639
Your Highness.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.670
Ministry of Revenue oversees
household registration and finances.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.920
It concerns the people,
leaving no room for error.

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.160
Moreover,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.360
the people's welfare concerns the state.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.279
I believe that even Princess Royal

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.920
has no right to intervene.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.240
You look down on me.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.199
But what if I say

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.720
this is His Majesty's order?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.680
His Majesty?

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:53.759
His Majesty has entrusted me
to fully handle this matter.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.759
Official Li,
are you resisting the order?

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:58.040
I dare not resist,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.800
but I cannot bear to see

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.639
His Majesty deceived by traitors.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:02.439
Insolence!

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:05.759
It seems

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:09.000
Official Li holds a grudge against me.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.920
How about you explain in detail?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.120
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.240
Vice Minister Wang.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.240
(Ledgers of Year 35 of Jiande)
Are you familiar with these ledgers?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.439
Every sum you embezzled

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.800
is traceable.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.279
Confess immediately!

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:37.199
Forgive me.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.360
Forgive me.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.959
If you insist on shielding him,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.530
I will report it at the cost of my life.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.920
I will question His Majesty

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.000
who allowed this rat

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.560
to touch Ministry of Revenue?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.079
You...

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:51.680
- Please deal with Vice Minister Wang.
- Please deal with Vice Minister Wang.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.040
Imprison him first.
We'll discuss it later.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.600
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.759
Your Highness, forgive me!
Your Highness!

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:07.319
Your Highness, forgive me!

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.279
Li Yuanze.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.000
Just you wait.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.480
Victory and defeat
are common in warfare.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.480
What's the matter?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.680
Already losing your patience?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.120
I believed

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.279
having you

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:32.559
will make this a sure victory.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:33.840
It seems

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.360
I overestimated you.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.799
Who said you lost?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.399
A fence-sitter like Vice Minister Wang

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.279
sways to

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.279
whoever benefits him.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.240
A small punishment

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.919
will teach him boundaries.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:54.200
Once he suffers enough,

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:55.559
we'll help him again.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.639
Are you worried about

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:00.440
not being able to train a loyal dog?

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:12.120
I

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.840
shall wait and see.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.900
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.240
We can't keep a traitor
like Vice Minister Wang.

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:39.360
If he becomes Gan Sheng's lapdog
in Ministry of Revenue,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.399
it will be disastrous.

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:45.320
Fortunately,
Official Li is in court today.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.200
Originally,

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.759
I wanted to stabilize Gan Sheng

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.080
before planning ahead.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:55.440
Without him,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.840
I can still devise a solution.

00:09:58.759 --> 00:09:59.600
What is it?

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.799
The solution?

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:06.279
Yuanze, what is it?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.000
To resolve this,

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.559
- there's only one way left.
- There's only one way left.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.720
And that's...

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:30.360
Act before Gan Sheng.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.240
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:09.399
Vice Minister Wang.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.840
You've disappointed me.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.120
Official Li really has refined tastes.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.720
Strolling here at midnight.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.639
Could it be

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:20.879
you came here

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:22.519
to pay respects to your mentor?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.360
I'll give you one last chance.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.799
Hand over the evidence
of your collusion with Gan Sheng,

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:29.399
and I might spare your life.

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:44.600
Li Yuanze.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.039
Do you think

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:48.759
this is still when Liu Zhen was alive?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.039
Jing has long since changed.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.519
Gentle as a crane,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.159
a courteous gentleman?

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:58.480
Bah!

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.399
You're nothing more than

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.840
a favored companion
discarded by Princess Royal!

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:08.759
I'm afraid

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.279
your body

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.960
has long been wrecked.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.559
I'll tell you the truth.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.159
Soon,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.200
Princess Royal and General Gan

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.080
will release me from here.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.759
Why not kneel now,

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:27.679
bang your head a few times, and beg me?

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:29.720
I can

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:32.279
put in a good word for you
before Princess Royal,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.559
so that she

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.039
accepts you back.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.639
How about that?

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.840
Princess Royal is heading this way.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.620
Hear that?

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.820
Princess Royal is here to save me.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.500
So what if I'm involved
in bribery and corruption?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.020
Being on the right side
is better than being a good official.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.020
In the end,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.540
Ministry of Revenue is still mine...

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.940
Li Yuanze, you've gone mad.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.100
Executing court officials without orders

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.700
is a capital crime.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.500
The late emperor
gave me this imperial sword

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.700
that's perfect
for removing corrupt officials

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.140
and upholding court order.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.500
How could I fail His Majesty?

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.380
Also,

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.980
who said I killed you?

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.060
