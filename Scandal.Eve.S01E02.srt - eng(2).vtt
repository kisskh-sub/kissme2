00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.032
Kuryu Fujiwara, a famous actor,
is alleged to have drunk alcohol

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.077
and engaged in adultery
with an underage woman five years ago.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.370
Any thoughts, Mr. Kumai?

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:20.250
With regard to adultery,
he said that nothing sexual took place.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:26.172
But even if we assume that he did do so,
she was 19 years old at the time,

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:28.925
so he would not face
any legal repercussions.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.095
And he seems to have
resolved it with his wife as well.

00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:33.429
It does seem so.

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:38.393
The problem is,
they were photographed drinking together.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:40.395
Yes, these are the pictures.

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.815
Maybe he should take
some time off from work.

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:46.150
I don't think people want to see him,

00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:51.990
knowing that he got an underage girl drunk
and took her to a hotel.

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:54.200
-Moeka. Morning.
-We haven't heard anything…

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:55.243
Good morning.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.620
-What are you up to?
-Nothing.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.792
KURYU FUJIWARA DRANK
AND CHEATED WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL

00:01:02.876 --> 00:01:04.586
It's all over social media.

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:09.132
And every news program
has been talking about it all day.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:15.138
As for the show he's a part of,
I doubt they'll be able to keep him on.

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:22.645
What an unfortunate situation for Kuryu,
even if he did bring this upon himself.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.940
We could have protected him
if he was still with us.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:27.734
You sound happy.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.073
Dad.

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:36.951
Don't you think
you're overestimating Ioka?

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:41.247
If you let someone get away
with poaching a talent

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:44.375
and branching off
from the agency they owe so much to,

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.628
we'd have no order in this industry.

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:49.214
Order, you say?

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.341
Yes, why?

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.057
You just don't get it, do you?

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:13.363
Mr. Chairman.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.077
Just leave the agency's affairs to me
and focus on resting.

00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:27.293
The press conference
backfired on him. If he hadn't held it…

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:28.628
Good morning.

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:31.714
Kanade, the Fujiwara article
is the talk of the town.

00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:34.425
All the morning news programs
are talking about it.

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:37.428
The underage drinking is a big no-no.

00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:40.098
-Good job discovering that.
-Thanks.

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:42.642
And? Don't tell me that's all you have.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.769
Well, who can say?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.855
-Mizuguchi? Come here.
-Yes.

00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:52.360
Sir.

00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:54.445
-The contract.
-Right.

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:08.584
Mr. Ueda,
I'm really sorry for the trouble--

00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:11.129
The client, Aoi Beer, sent a response.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:16.467
I'm afraid it's mostly bad news for you.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:21.014
First of all, your contract
with Aoi Beer will be terminated.

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:25.184
Any and all commercials
featuring Mr. Fujiwara will not be aired,

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.395
and all outdoor ads will be removed.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.525
Secondly, and I know
this is what concerns you most.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:34.610
The indemnities?

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:38.948
The client is asking for this sum
as reparation for Mr. Fujiwara's conduct.

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.368
TOTAL AMOUNT 306,480,000 YEN

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:43.494
Three hundred million?!

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:46.789
It includes minor costs
such as filming and labor,

00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.917
but the biggest component
is the damage to their brand.

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.586
Wait, but…

00:03:52.337 --> 00:03:56.299
Still, isn't 300 million a bit too much?

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:59.844
I understand the cancellation fees
and the filming costs, but--

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:03.681
"If a talent's misconduct causes
severe reputational damage to the brand,

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:06.142
the brand has a right to be indemnified."

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.770
It's written in the advertising contract.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.858
Aoi Beer sees it as a disrepute
for one of their contracted talents

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:16.903
to be in the news
for drinking with an underage girl.

00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:19.197
Three hundred million is a fair ask.

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:20.907
Um…

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.827
Can I get a chance to talk directly
to Aoi Beer's representative?

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:28.873
Give me a break!

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:33.669
How much extra work
do you think we've already had to do?

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:36.547
Talk to them directly?

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:38.800
You'll just make them angrier.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.892
Three hundred million?
We'll go under if we have to pay that.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:50.686
-Could we get a bank to finance it?
-There's no chance.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.190
No bank would be willing
to finance us after this scandal.

00:04:54.774 --> 00:04:57.276
And Fujiwara's projects
keep getting cancelled.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.695
At this rate, even his drama role might…

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.407
Noguchi, the producer, contacted me.

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:05.159
He said Kuryu might get replaced.

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:06.369
That's just…

00:05:06.452 --> 00:05:08.830
Saki, welcome back.

00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:11.874
-I checked the contract with Aoi Beer.
-And?

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.837
Sadly, the clause about your liability
in causing reputational damage

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.175
to their brand makes it difficult
for you to refute their demand.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.761
So we have no choice
but to shut up and pay?

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:27.723
There might be one way to avoid it.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:29.434
Huh?

00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:32.437
CONTRACT

00:05:33.563 --> 00:05:36.691
I checked the contract
between this agency and Mr. Fujiwara.

00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:42.113
This clause says,

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:46.367
"If the talent's private conduct
causes any damage to the agency,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.953
the talent may be held liable
for the damages."

00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:51.455
Wait, are you saying

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:54.876
we make Fujiwara pay the money
instead of us?

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:57.420
If you do, the agency will survive.

00:05:57.503 --> 00:05:58.921
-But that…
-Are you serious?

00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:02.091
It's 300 million yen!
Fujiwara can't pay that much.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:03.509
Can your agency pay it?

00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:07.221
If you keep trying to protect
Mr. Fujiwara,

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:10.391
your agency might become unable
to sustain itself financially.

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.811
How will you justify that
to your other talents?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.354
That's…

00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:18.774
I'll go talk to Kuryu.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:53.726
Ms. Mirei, where are you…

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.853
It's none of your business.

00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:06.030
In the end,
I just made myself look like a fool.

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:11.285
Our lives are in shambles,
and it's because of you and him.

00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:18.084
I shouldn't have let you coax me into it.

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:35.268
-Can I ask some questions?
-No.

00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:36.269
Out of my way.

00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:39.855
Stay away.
Can't you see I'm carrying a baby?

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:42.483
Stop it!

00:07:43.693 --> 00:07:45.319
Don't push!

00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:53.327
In other news,

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:57.373
Weekly Buncho published a story
on the actor Kuryu Fujiwara,

00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:01.961
alleging that he drank alcohol
and had an affair with an underage woman.

00:08:02.962 --> 00:08:05.631
According to the article,
he met the woman in 2021,

00:08:05.715 --> 00:08:08.342
when she was 19 years old.

00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:10.636
After drinking together,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.056
he spent the night with her
at a hotel in Yokohama.

00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:20.396
The article contains pictures
showing the two of them drinking.

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:23.316
-And also, lying in a bed together.
-Kuryu.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:26.611
He's receiving strong backlash,
especially on social media.

00:08:27.653 --> 00:08:31.824
-His agency hasn't given any statement--
-Saki…

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.953
I brought some food. Eat up.

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:41.709
What's…

00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:45.421
going to become of me?

00:08:47.715 --> 00:08:51.427
What about the show and the ads?

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:55.806
It's bad, isn't it?

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.017
The indemnities and all.

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:06.442
I'm so horrible. I troubled you so much.

00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:10.154
And the agency.

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:15.910
I know an apology won't fix anything.

00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:20.956
I'll do something about the money.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:25.961
Do something, how?

00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:28.798
I…

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:33.219
You can't do anything about it alone.

00:09:40.184 --> 00:09:42.770
What do you think we're here for?

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:54.865
I'm sorry.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.911
Saki…

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:06.001
There's no time for crying.

00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:12.174
I came here to ask you something.

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:14.719
About that day.

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:17.471
I need more details.

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:27.773
Hello there.

00:10:31.777 --> 00:10:35.114
You were in Mr. Fujiwara's room, right?
How is he doing?

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.910
It seems like his wife left.

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:43.539
I can't really blame her,

00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:46.917
especially after she swallowed
her pride for that press conference.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.463
I guess it completely backfired, huh?

00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:56.302
Would you mind giving me
a comment instead?

00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:58.637
About Mr. Fujiwara's future plans.

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:04.769
Can I assume he will be taking a break?

00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:08.522
He has to pay for breaching
his contract with Aoi Beer, no?

00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:12.651
You're Kanade Hirata
from Weekly Buncho, right?

00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:14.612
Yes.

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:15.988
You don't have to worry.

00:11:16.697 --> 00:11:19.950
Neither my agency nor Fujiwara
will let things end like this.

00:11:22.203 --> 00:11:24.622
Thank you for the comment.

00:11:32.713 --> 00:11:35.299
Kagawa? Contact Mr. Tozaki for me.

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:37.718
Tell him I need his help urgently.

00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:38.969
Understood.

00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:43.432
And also, reschedule
all my plans for tomorrow.

00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:45.392
What? But why?

00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:48.270
I'll go meet that woman.

00:12:03.619 --> 00:12:06.872
Here's all the info we have
on Moeka Tanabe.

00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:11.252
She used to be a member
of Mr. Fujiwara's fan club.

00:12:12.127 --> 00:12:15.047
She currently works
as a dentist's assistant in Yokohama.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.550
INVESTIGATION RESULTS

00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:19.927
What will you do with this information?

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:22.513
When he met Moeka Tanabe that night,

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:26.100
Kuryu said that he asked her age,
and she said she was 20.

00:12:26.183 --> 00:12:29.186
I see! So Mr. Fujiwara was lied to?

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.815
Aoi Beer is demanding compensation
on the basis of Fujiwara's misconduct

00:12:32.898 --> 00:12:36.694
causing severe reputational damage
to their brand.

00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:39.446
However, if Moeka Tanabe
joined a drinking party

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.323
while falsifying her age,

00:12:41.407 --> 00:12:43.033
Fujiwara's not to blame.

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:47.621
If we can prove that,
we might avoid paying indemnities!

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:50.749
But Mr. Fujiwara's admission alone
won't count for much.

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:54.503
That's why I'll get Moeka Tanabe herself
to give her admission.

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:57.631
That she lied about being of age
and was drinking.

00:12:57.715 --> 00:13:00.926
Then, if I can get
other magazines to publish her account…

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.720
You can alter public perception

00:13:02.803 --> 00:13:06.181
to make Mr. Fujiwara
seem like a victim instead of a wrongdoer.

00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:07.182
Exactly.

00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:10.060
But do you think
she'll agree to it that easily?

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:14.273
I'll make her do it.
We don't have any other options.

00:13:15.357 --> 00:13:19.320
There's also one more thing
I need you to investigate for me.

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:22.031
Investigate what?

00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:34.960
Topics for next week's issue.

00:13:35.044 --> 00:13:36.253
Tell me what you've got.

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:38.881
-Let's go with--
-Sir.

00:13:38.964 --> 00:13:41.342
Let’s follow up
on Fujiwara as the cover story.

00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:45.054
For the first article, I tracked down
Moeka Tanabe, the woman he was with,

00:13:45.137 --> 00:13:47.514
and found out
that she was underage at the time,

00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:49.767
but she refused to tell me more.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.977
I feel like she's hiding something.

00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:53.812
-I want to talk to her again--
-No!

00:13:54.647 --> 00:13:55.481
What?

00:13:55.564 --> 00:13:58.859
Ninomiya does the cover story
on the Chief Secretary's affair.

00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:00.736
-But sir--
-Mizuguchi!

00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:04.615
How about the illegal gambling
of Nansei University's rugby club?

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:07.034
Yes, sir.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:10.913
The bar with the underground casino
was members-only, so I couldn't enter it,

00:14:10.996 --> 00:14:13.540
but I managed to talk
to a club member as they left.

00:14:13.624 --> 00:14:15.417
According to them, an alumnus…

00:14:16.543 --> 00:14:18.921
Sir, why won't you allow
another article on--

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:20.047
It's already enough.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.967
It doesn't seem like
any new facts will come out.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.679
How about interviewing the people
from the bar he drank at that day?

00:14:26.762 --> 00:14:27.930
I know where it is.

00:14:28.013 --> 00:14:30.224
It won't make as big of a splash.

00:14:30.307 --> 00:14:31.392
I disagree.

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:34.895
It's best to do a follow-up
while it's still being talked about.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.148
Leave the Fujiwara story alone.

00:14:39.566 --> 00:14:40.401
But why?

00:14:40.484 --> 00:14:45.531
All I asked you was to confirm
with his agency and write an article.

00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:48.367
I didn't ask you
to get in touch with Moeka Tanabe.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.493
But…

00:14:50.744 --> 00:14:54.873
But that was the reason
I found out about the underage drinking.

00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:04.717
Go assist Ninomiya with his story.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.663
I can't believe he's stopping me
from doing a follow-up story.

00:15:34.747 --> 00:15:37.708
He's the one who assigned me
the story in the first place.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.918
Yeah, it's not like him at all.

00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:43.172
Normally, he just tells us
to go for whatever will sell.

00:15:43.255 --> 00:15:44.381
Right?

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:48.844
I'm looking for Mr. Ninomiya
from Weekly Buncho.

00:15:48.927 --> 00:15:50.429
Do you have an appointment?

00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:54.808
I haven't been able
to get in touch with him.

00:15:55.601 --> 00:15:57.519
He won't answer my calls.

00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.313
I'm sorry.

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:03.067
But unless you have an appointment,
I can't help you.

00:16:06.153 --> 00:16:09.615
Might as well drop it, if he says so.

00:16:09.698 --> 00:16:12.576
It could hurt your prospects
if you make him angry.

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:15.579
Your goal is to transfer to
the literature department, right?

00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:17.831
That's not relevant to this.

00:16:17.915 --> 00:16:21.919
Maybe there's a reason
he doesn't want you to dig deeper.

00:16:22.002 --> 00:16:22.920
Mizuguchi!

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.922
Would you do me a favor?

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:26.215
What?

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:32.387
ACCOUNT STATEMENT
DEPOSIT - BUNCHO 3,000,000 YEN

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:48.153
Mr. Ninomiya.

00:16:48.862 --> 00:16:49.696
What?

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.617
Hello. It's Mizuguchi.
I'm here as your substitute assistant.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.327
Staking out that hotel?

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.453
What about Hirata?

00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:59.498
She went somewhere,
saying she had something to do.

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:02.334
Went where?

00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:08.257
Did you see the news about Kuryu Fujiwara?

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.261
I did. Apparently the hotel
in the pictures is in this area.

00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:14.221
Wait, seriously?

00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:17.599
I can't believe the woman
sold the pictures to a magazine.

00:17:18.225 --> 00:17:20.644
Maybe it's revenge for a one-night stand.

00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:24.022
He said they didn't do it, though.

00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:26.608
Yeah, but can you take his word for it?

00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:30.070
Excuse me.

00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:32.156
You're Ms. Moeka Tanabe, right?

00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:34.575
Yes, why?

00:17:34.658 --> 00:17:37.911
I am Saki Ioka from Rafale.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.455
Rafale?

00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:41.915
AFFILIATED ACTORS
KURYU FUJIWARA

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.378
I'd like to talk to you
about your involvement with Fujiwara.

00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:49.298
Please let me talk to you.

00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:50.883
I have nothing to say.

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:52.593
I need a favor from you.

00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:54.052
That's not my problem.

00:17:54.553 --> 00:17:58.140
I promise you,
this is important for you too.

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:08.984
Chief Kodama, I deeply apologize
for the delay in filming

00:18:09.067 --> 00:18:11.612
caused by the matter with Fujiwara.

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:18.827
We can't keep Mr. Aso's schedule open
for much longer.

00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:21.830
If this continues,
we might even have to reconsider

00:18:21.914 --> 00:18:24.499
Mr. Aso's participation
in this project altogether.

00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:26.460
Please, is there any way--

00:18:26.543 --> 00:18:29.379
How does your station
intend to handle things?

00:18:32.382 --> 00:18:35.010
Alright, we'll drop Kuryu Fujiwara.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.639
We'll resume filming
as soon as a substitute is decided.

00:18:38.722 --> 00:18:42.559
In that case, may I suggest
Ichinose, one of our talents?

00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:43.977
Ichinose?

00:18:44.061 --> 00:18:47.189
He fits the same archetype,
and his schedule is open.

00:18:47.272 --> 00:18:48.315
Please wait.

00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:50.692
Isn't it too early to do a recast?

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:52.444
How so?

00:18:53.612 --> 00:18:57.449
Mr. Fujiwara's agency says
they're still checking the details.

00:18:57.532 --> 00:18:58.367
What?

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:01.203
What makes you think that matters?

00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:02.579
Mr. Noguchi.

00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:06.291
It was your decision
to cast Kuryu for the role, wasn't it?

00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:08.335
Yes.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:13.966
I understand your attachment,
but do you understand the situation?

00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:21.890
You conspired with Ms. Ioka

00:19:21.974 --> 00:19:25.727
and went directly to the chairman
to get him to allow Kuryu's involvement.

00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:29.856
I assume you're belittling
me and my authority.

00:19:31.024 --> 00:19:34.528
If you keep behaving like this,

00:19:34.611 --> 00:19:39.032
maybe I need to reconsider
our relationship with your company.

00:19:39.783 --> 00:19:45.122
I will have all of our talents
withdrawn from JBS projects.

00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:47.416
Please forgive us!

00:19:47.499 --> 00:19:51.336
I'll get my superiors' approval
for Kuryu's replacement right away.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.297
So please. Noguchi!

00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.718
I apologize.

00:19:58.343 --> 00:19:59.303
We apologize!

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:02.306
Get to it quickly, would you?

00:20:02.389 --> 00:20:04.808
Yes, most certainly.

00:20:05.892 --> 00:20:06.727
Let's go.

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:20.282
You're the one in these pictures, right?

00:20:22.659 --> 00:20:24.369
I assume you're already aware,

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.248
but an article written
about you and him caused a big fuss.

00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:31.376
But this isn't my fault--

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.922
Back then, you lied to Fujiwara
and told him you were of age, didn't you?

00:20:37.758 --> 00:20:39.509
Fujiwara told me.

00:20:41.219 --> 00:20:44.931
You hid the fact that you were underage
and joined the drinking party.

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:47.184
None of it was Fujiwara's fault.

00:20:47.267 --> 00:20:49.478
I want you to go public with that story.

00:20:52.356 --> 00:20:54.649
We'll arrange the means.

00:20:54.733 --> 00:20:57.235
We promise to protect your privacy.

00:20:57.319 --> 00:21:00.322
We won't blame you
for leaking these photographs.

00:21:00.822 --> 00:21:02.240
Wait a second.

00:21:02.324 --> 00:21:05.285
I wasn't the one
who gave the pictures to the magazine.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.415
I'm not happy about it
becoming such a big deal either.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:14.252
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

00:21:15.087 --> 00:21:18.340
I'd like to know that myself.

00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:25.013
I understand your situation.

00:21:26.348 --> 00:21:29.684
That makes it even more important
for you to let the public know.

00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:32.229
What? I don't want to.

00:21:32.312 --> 00:21:34.648
I'd become the target if I did that.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.652
I'm already terrified
that people might dox me.

00:21:38.735 --> 00:21:41.988
Even if you do nothing,
you've already been identified.

00:21:43.782 --> 00:21:46.827
The public is convinced
that you leaked this story.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.621
And they will bash you
as soon as news comes out.

00:21:50.122 --> 00:21:52.707
They might indeed expose
your personal information.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.127
Not to mention,

00:21:56.128 --> 00:21:59.506
you were a member
of Fujiwara's fan club, weren't you?

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:05.929
If people find that out,
other fans might come after you.

00:22:08.265 --> 00:22:10.308
Your job might be at risk too.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.897
Even if this is a private affair,
if your workplace finds out,

00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:19.443
there's a good chance
that you'll lose your job.

00:22:23.488 --> 00:22:24.698
Are you threatening me?

00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:26.950
I'm saying this for your sake.

00:22:29.995 --> 00:22:33.915
For both our sakes,
let's put this matter to rest quickly.

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.794
You lied about your age
and joined the party.

00:22:37.878 --> 00:22:40.422
Nothing happened between you and him.

00:22:40.505 --> 00:22:43.175
And you weren't the one who made the leak.

00:22:43.258 --> 00:22:45.844
I want you to go public
with these three facts.

00:22:54.644 --> 00:22:55.937
It's getting late.

00:22:56.855 --> 00:22:58.523
I have to get back to work.

00:22:59.107 --> 00:23:00.859
I need some time to think.

00:23:00.942 --> 00:23:04.196
Can I meet you again
after you get off work today?

00:23:04.863 --> 00:23:06.239
I will contact you.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.499
-Kagawa.
-Yeah?

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:17.626
Your phone's ringing.

00:23:17.709 --> 00:23:19.920
Thanks. Talk to you later.

00:23:26.384 --> 00:23:27.552
Hello?

00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:28.637
Hello, Kagawa?

00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:31.473
-I talked to Moeka Tanabe.
-Seriously?

00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:33.767
I think I can get her admission tonight.

00:23:34.392 --> 00:23:36.394
Did you arrange a publisher?

00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:38.772
Weekly Journal should work.

00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:41.900
Okay. For the writer,
let's go with Ms. Fukumoto.

00:23:41.983 --> 00:23:44.569
She wrote a special feature
on Fujiwara before.

00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:46.071
Got it.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.031
And also,

00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:52.077
the one who sold the pictures
to Buncho wasn't Moeka Tanabe.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.205
What? Then who was it?

00:23:55.956 --> 00:23:57.290
Oh, I see.

00:24:01.544 --> 00:24:02.545
What?

00:24:03.296 --> 00:24:04.381
Sorry, it's nothing.

00:24:19.062 --> 00:24:20.355
Hello? Saki Ioka speaking.

00:24:20.438 --> 00:24:21.564
Ms. Ioka.

00:24:22.065 --> 00:24:25.735
Behind the scenes,
they're trying to replace Fujiwara

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:27.696
with Ichinose from Kodama Productions.

00:24:28.905 --> 00:24:31.157
When will it be finalized?

00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:33.368
It's awaiting
executive approval right now.

00:24:33.451 --> 00:24:36.329
It’s expected
to be finalized by early next week.

00:24:36.413 --> 00:24:38.832
There's no stopping it after that point.

00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:44.004
In other words, there's still a chance
to stop it right now, correct?

00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:45.755
What?

00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:48.008
Thank you for the call.

00:24:56.516 --> 00:25:01.062
It's Tanabe.
Can you come to this place at 7:00 p.m.?

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.440
I will talk to you there.

00:25:24.377 --> 00:25:26.129
So it's just as I thought.

00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:28.423
Thank you.

00:25:53.907 --> 00:25:54.908
Have a seat.

00:26:13.885 --> 00:26:16.012
Sorry if I kept you waiting.

00:26:16.096 --> 00:26:16.930
Not at all.

00:26:22.477 --> 00:26:25.814
So, have you decided?

00:26:26.815 --> 00:26:28.650
Will you give your statement?

00:26:31.986 --> 00:26:32.821
Yes.

00:26:35.323 --> 00:26:36.783
I'm very grateful.

00:26:47.544 --> 00:26:52.674
Before I do it,
will I get any compensation for it?

00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:57.053
Yes, though it'll be a meager sum--

00:26:57.137 --> 00:26:58.138
Thirty million yen…

00:27:00.682 --> 00:27:02.517
I want 30 million yen.

00:27:03.184 --> 00:27:05.478
I won't give my statement otherwise.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.316
If you want my statement,
you'll have to give me the money.

00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:14.154
What happened? Where's this coming from?

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.489
That's…

00:27:17.115 --> 00:27:17.949
Well…

00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:23.121
Mind if I butt in?

00:27:26.416 --> 00:27:28.877
Moeka is one of our regulars.

00:27:29.502 --> 00:27:32.005
She told me about what's going on.

00:27:36.718 --> 00:27:38.970
I get that things are tough for you,

00:27:39.053 --> 00:27:43.433
but she'd be putting a lot on the line
by making a public statement.

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:47.604
Given the risk you're forcing her to take,

00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:50.815
it's only natural for you
to pay her at least this much.

00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:53.318
I don't see how this concerns you.

00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:55.528
She asked for my help, you see.

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:01.659
You threatened her, didn't you?

00:28:03.828 --> 00:28:06.664
That she'd get fired
if people found out about it.

00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:12.212
Ain't no surprise
that she'd freak out after hearing that.

00:28:13.463 --> 00:28:14.506
Right?

00:28:17.425 --> 00:28:21.012
You want Moeka's statement, don't you?

00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:24.432
Then just pay up!

00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:30.396
Fujiwara's acting career
depends on it, doesn't it?

00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:35.818
Convinced yet?

00:28:39.072 --> 00:28:40.156
I see.

00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:44.035
So you put her up to it,
Mr. Masafumi Okada.

00:28:45.995 --> 00:28:46.830
What?

00:28:48.081 --> 00:28:52.293
You invite talents to your bar
and have women attend to them.

00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:54.671
I hear that you're the one

00:28:54.754 --> 00:28:58.299
who arranged the drinking party
with Kuryu and Moeka at this bar.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.511
And what about it?

00:29:01.594 --> 00:29:04.764
We have a lawyer specialized
in the entertainment industry.

00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:09.769
According to his investigation,
it turns out you were involved in

00:29:09.853 --> 00:29:12.939
a suspicious number
of scandals in recent years.

00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:16.317
So it's just as I thought.

00:29:17.277 --> 00:29:18.736
Thank you.

00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:33.376
You sell the details of scandals from
celebrities coming to your bar, right?

00:29:37.755 --> 00:29:39.966
Did you show him
the pictures with Fujiwara?

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:43.720
I have.

00:29:44.387 --> 00:29:45.763
But I never gave the data!

00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:48.308
If you come here regularly,

00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:51.269
it's easy for him
to copy it when you're drunk.

00:29:52.353 --> 00:29:53.187
What? But then…

00:29:53.855 --> 00:29:57.191
Is he the one who sold
the pictures to the magazine?

00:29:57.942 --> 00:29:59.027
Well?

00:30:01.362 --> 00:30:02.614
Did you?

00:30:04.532 --> 00:30:07.493
Please! Answer me! Why?

00:30:07.994 --> 00:30:09.704
-You ruined--
-Shut up!

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.539
Pipe down!

00:30:16.544 --> 00:30:18.880
Do you have proof
that I sold the pictures?

00:30:19.797 --> 00:30:20.715
Do you?!

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:23.509
It's all speculation!

00:30:25.011 --> 00:30:26.888
You want her statement, right?

00:30:27.597 --> 00:30:30.350
Then shut up and pay up!

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:34.938
And if you don't feel up to it,

00:30:36.731 --> 00:30:38.858
you're going to have a bad time.

00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:40.902
Got it?!

00:30:43.196 --> 00:30:45.907
You're the one
who's going to have a bad time.

00:30:49.118 --> 00:30:52.372
I've recorded this entire conversation.

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:59.587
You regularly invite underage girls
to drinking parties

00:31:00.505 --> 00:31:02.423
and knowingly serve them alcohol.

00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:06.594
If this fact gets out,
you'll be in legal trouble.

00:31:06.678 --> 00:31:08.680
This place would go out of business.

00:31:15.561 --> 00:31:18.773
If people know that you bring
underage girls to drinking parties

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.026
to get dirt on celebrities and sell it,

00:31:23.194 --> 00:31:25.488
no one will ever come to you again.

00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:30.868
That would be bad
for your business, right?

00:31:34.664 --> 00:31:35.707
And you too.

00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:39.210
Nothing good will come
of being involved with him.

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:42.213
You need to respect yourself more.

00:31:47.093 --> 00:31:48.302
Let's go somewhere else.

00:31:54.183 --> 00:31:55.476
Too bad for you.

00:31:58.062 --> 00:31:59.063
Wait.

00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:02.275
You're wrong about one thing.

00:32:02.358 --> 00:32:04.193
Not that it's my problem.

00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:07.947
-What do you--
-Just get the hell out!

00:32:08.031 --> 00:32:09.115
Damn it.

00:32:24.464 --> 00:32:25.423
Wait.

00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:27.550
I'm sorry.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.554
Are you willing
to give your statement now?

00:32:32.889 --> 00:32:33.723
Yes.

00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:51.783
Excuse me.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.619
We're not open yet. Come back later.

00:32:54.702 --> 00:32:56.579
I work for Weekly Buncho.

00:32:57.747 --> 00:32:59.415
Mr. Masafumi Okada, right?

00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:01.751
Is this a good time to talk?

00:33:10.718 --> 00:33:14.764
Weekly Journal reports
that the woman who was with Mr. Fujiwara

00:33:14.847 --> 00:33:18.726
had lied about her age
to participate in a drinking party.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.103
Any thoughts, Mr. Kumai?

00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:25.191
Right. Well, Mr. Fujiwara
was deceived in this instance,

00:33:25.274 --> 00:33:27.527
so you could say he's the victim here.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:33.407
I think the people in the media,
as well as on online platforms,

00:33:33.491 --> 00:33:38.955
who bashed him without waiting for details
should feel ashamed of themselves.

00:33:39.038 --> 00:33:42.083
These people are so thoughtless.

00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:44.377
They've completely reversed
their position.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.129
That's how they always are.

00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:48.339
Everyone just jumped to conclusions.

00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:51.050
You have to feel for him.

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:51.968
Hello?

00:33:52.051 --> 00:33:53.469
His career was threatened…

00:33:53.553 --> 00:33:54.387
Right.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.056
…and his reputation damaged
all based on speculation.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.974
Yes.

00:33:59.058 --> 00:34:00.434
Is that so?

00:34:01.352 --> 00:34:03.146
Understood. Bye.

00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:06.190
Who was it?

00:34:06.983 --> 00:34:07.900
The chief.

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:10.278
Things got resolved with Aoi Beer.

00:34:10.903 --> 00:34:15.199
Given that Fujiwara wasn't at fault,
they won't demand any compensation.

00:34:15.783 --> 00:34:17.201
Thank goodness.

00:34:17.285 --> 00:34:19.954
Not just that, he's still in the show too.

00:34:21.747 --> 00:34:24.375
Wow, what a relief.

00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:27.336
It seemed uncertain
if the show to commemorate

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.007
JBS TV's 70th anniversary
would even make it to the screen.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.383
Mr. Chairman!

00:34:33.009 --> 00:34:34.510
What is the meaning of this?

00:34:35.261 --> 00:34:36.429
Of what?

00:34:36.512 --> 00:34:40.558
…so I imagine
he can get back to work immediately.

00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:41.934
I'd say that--

00:34:43.019 --> 00:34:44.645
Kuryu's replacement.

00:34:45.479 --> 00:34:50.026
I heard that you personally intervened
right as it was about to be approved.

00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:51.652
You heard right.

00:34:53.821 --> 00:34:55.740
Did Ioka ask you to?

00:34:55.823 --> 00:34:58.492
No, I did it of my own accord!

00:34:58.576 --> 00:35:02.079
-But why?
-I'll tell you why.

00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:11.505
Are you…

00:35:12.548 --> 00:35:13.549
Dad?

00:35:14.383 --> 00:35:16.010
Call the doctor!

00:35:16.093 --> 00:35:17.678
-Okay.
-Hurry!

00:35:17.762 --> 00:35:19.805
WAIT, SO IT WASN'T KURYU'S FAULT?

00:35:19.889 --> 00:35:22.642
DID HE JUST GET FRAMED OR WHAT?

00:35:26.812 --> 00:35:29.065
Here, I brought some food for you.

00:35:30.191 --> 00:35:31.484
Thanks.

00:35:35.404 --> 00:35:38.532
Also, I got this.

00:35:39.992 --> 00:35:41.202
Curry powder?

00:35:42.912 --> 00:35:46.832
There were times
that I didn't feel like eating anything.

00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:50.044
But I could eat anything
after I put this on it.

00:35:51.587 --> 00:35:53.339
Believe in the curry powder.

00:35:56.509 --> 00:35:57.969
You lost me there.

00:36:05.351 --> 00:36:09.021
We're negotiating for you
to keep your role in the drama.

00:36:12.275 --> 00:36:14.026
It's not over yet.

00:36:15.736 --> 00:36:16.988
Let's turn things around.

00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:20.199
Okay.

00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:23.953
Eat up.

00:36:26.247 --> 00:36:27.248
Thanks for the food.

00:36:56.152 --> 00:36:57.111
Is it good?

00:37:09.707 --> 00:37:10.541
That good?

00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:21.552
You can take it slow.

00:37:30.603 --> 00:37:33.022
Hey! Watch it! Watch it!

00:37:33.898 --> 00:37:34.982
Relax.

00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:37.443
You're rushing too much.

00:37:38.778 --> 00:37:40.571
Here, take this.

00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:42.823
Sorry.

00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:45.826
It's all over the table.

00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:50.915
Time of death, 4:35 p.m.

00:38:40.089 --> 00:38:43.008
FUNERAL CEREMONY SHIGERU KODAMA

00:39:53.162 --> 00:39:54.371
Ms. Ioka.

00:39:54.955 --> 00:39:56.040
Mr. Noguchi.

00:39:57.458 --> 00:40:00.085
I hear it was quite sudden.

00:40:00.836 --> 00:40:04.340
Yes, I'm still in disbelief.

00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:09.553
I wish he had stayed with us longer.

00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:13.015
The truth is,

00:40:13.557 --> 00:40:19.396
he was the one who put a stop
to the effort to replace Kuryu.

00:40:20.356 --> 00:40:21.398
He was?

00:40:22.525 --> 00:40:26.403
But now, the industry
will enter a new phase.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:31.492
Kodama Productions will likely fall under
Ms. Yoko's complete control.

00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:53.722
FUNERAL CEREMONY SHIGERU KODAMA

00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:07.820
Can I talk to you?

00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:10.531
I'm Hirata from Weekly Buncho.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.993
It's about Mr. Kuryu Fujiwara's scandal.

00:41:15.661 --> 00:41:19.415
The other day, I went to Yokohama
for a second round of investigation.

00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:22.960
The barkeeper there
told me something intriguing.

00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:25.379
I see.

00:41:26.422 --> 00:41:29.758
So you're the one
who wrote that scoop on Fujiwara?

00:41:29.842 --> 00:41:30.676
Yes.

00:41:31.343 --> 00:41:34.722
I'm gathering information
for a follow-up article right now.

00:41:35.723 --> 00:41:38.392
So you came here to ask me stuff?

00:41:38.475 --> 00:41:40.311
I'll get straight to the point.

00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:44.023
Are you the one
who supplied us with the pictures?

00:41:49.862 --> 00:41:53.490
None of you people have any clue, huh?

00:41:54.491 --> 00:41:55.451
What do you mean?

00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.538
Let me tell you something juicy.

00:41:59.622 --> 00:42:01.707
Yeah, I did supply the pictures.

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:05.252
But not to your magazine.

00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:08.714
-What?
-It was to Kodama Productions.

00:42:11.967 --> 00:42:13.761
I sold them to the person

00:42:14.345 --> 00:42:17.931
who used to be in charge
of Kuryu Fujiwara five years ago.

00:42:19.558 --> 00:42:21.477
His manager? Who was it?

00:42:28.817 --> 00:42:30.486
A guy called Akashi.

00:42:32.154 --> 00:42:35.866
You bought the pictures five years ago
to try and suppress the scandal.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.578
Why did you decide to sell him out now,
after all this time?

00:42:41.622 --> 00:42:42.581
That's…

00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:46.710
Was it to tear down Saki Ioka,
who left your agency and started her own?

00:42:48.712 --> 00:42:52.716
A big player in the industry
that uses underhanded tactics

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.552
to suppress a smaller company
that threatens them.

00:42:57.096 --> 00:43:00.349
An exposé on the dark side
of the entertainment industry

00:43:00.432 --> 00:43:02.810
that has no regard for individual talents.

00:43:03.686 --> 00:43:05.521
That'll make for a good article.

00:43:06.313 --> 00:43:08.023
Are you willing to talk?

00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:40.597
PREVIEW

00:43:40.681 --> 00:43:42.391
A Weekly Buncho reporter visited me.

00:43:42.474 --> 00:43:43.600
Was that a coincidence?

00:43:43.684 --> 00:43:44.935
What are you digging for?

00:43:46.228 --> 00:43:48.397
BEHIND THE SCENE OF A SCANDAL…

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.982
You understand, right?

00:43:50.065 --> 00:43:52.109
You know what you must do now.

00:43:52.192 --> 00:43:54.111
A NEW TRUTH REVEALS ITSELF

00:43:54.194 --> 00:43:56.029
Do you have a moment?

00:43:56.113 --> 00:43:57.489
How did that go?

00:43:57.573 --> 00:44:00.200
Perhaps something that was more important.

00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:03.912
What an amusing story.

00:44:04.413 --> 00:44:05.205
So?

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:07.082
What are you implying?

00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:09.084
Let's make a deal, then.

00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:11.503
A BATTLE OF GIVE-AND-TAKE GONE TOO FAR

00:44:11.587 --> 00:44:13.046
One thing doesn't make sense.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.048
Why exactly this timing?

00:44:15.132 --> 00:44:16.508
This is a critical phase.

00:44:16.592 --> 00:44:18.177
Failure is not an option.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.345
-Why are you so invested in this story?
-I…

00:44:20.429 --> 00:44:21.805
Stay off this case.

00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:24.850
Was the feud caused by the incident
from five years ago?

00:44:25.768 --> 00:44:27.686
STEPPING INTO FORBIDDEN TERRITORY

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.564
You tabloid writers
always prey on people's lives.

00:44:30.647 --> 00:44:32.274
I will not dance to your tune.

00:44:32.983 --> 00:44:37.362
THE PRESSURE OF A MAJOR
AGENCY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

00:44:37.446 --> 00:44:42.201
WHAT DEEPER DARKNESS
WILL IOKA COME TO FACE?

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:48.916
