00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:04.876
Father,

00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:05.916
this time,

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.996
I really can't cover
for Moshang anymore.

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:10.037
He broke through

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.595
the barrier you set

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:13.117
just to see Feng Zhilou.

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:16.317
I tried to convince him
to come back to the sanctuary,

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:17.516
but I never imagined

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.676
he would team up with Feng Zhilou

00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:23.197
and use the sigil
to injure me this badly.

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:24.956
Where's Shang now?

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:27.116
He has to be with Feng Zhilou.

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:29.475
He's completely blinded by love.

00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:32.676
We kept waiting for Prince Shang
to come to his senses,

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:35.795
but instead he betrayed us.

00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:39.477
Just who is Feng Zhilou?

00:02:39.997 --> 00:02:43.997
How could she drive a wedge
between two dragon princes?

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.676
She's vicious!

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.075
She's practically a demon!

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:49.116
Your Majesty,

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:52.276
we went to the mortal realm
to meet Feng Zhilou

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:54.716
to help Prince Shang
break that obsession.

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:56.595
Feng Zhilou is the illegitimate daughter

00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:57.836
of the Feng family.

00:02:57.837 --> 00:03:01.080
Before she met Prince Shang, she had
no spiritual root and couldn't cultivate at all.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.876
She made a pact with the sigil.

00:03:02.877 --> 00:03:05.195
Her extreme Yin body
can cure the Yang poison.

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:07.676
That's how she bonded with Prince Shang.

00:03:07.677 --> 00:03:09.836
In terms of ability and character,

00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:11.437
she may be mortal,

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.276
but she's far better suited

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:14.635
than Princess Liluo

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:16.437
to become Dragon Queen.

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:19.556
Your Majesty,

00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:21.317
things are not as Prince Zhi
described them

00:03:21.557 --> 00:03:23.276
Prince Zhi fought Prince Shang.

00:03:23.277 --> 00:03:26.276
Prince Shang has lost his dragon horns
and without the dragon pearl to heal him,

00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:27.595
his organs are severely damaged.

00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:29.236
That's why he hasn't returned.

00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:30.595
Even without the dragon pearl,

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:32.355
Prince Shang forced his way
to the mortal realm

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:33.595
because he sensed Feng Zhilou

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:36.157
and the dragon child were in danger.

00:03:38.277 --> 00:03:39.236
What?

00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:41.636
Bai Lu,

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:43.956
what did you just say?

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:47.916
You said Feng Zhilou's
carrying a dragon child?

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:50.035
Your Majesty, it's true.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:52.757
After a thousand years,
you're finally going to have a grandson.

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:59.276
Shang always acts like

00:03:59.277 --> 00:04:00.836
he has no interest in anything.

00:04:00.837 --> 00:04:02.437
He finally came to his senses.

00:04:03.997 --> 00:04:05.836
How did he suddenly come to his senses?

00:04:05.837 --> 00:04:06.676
Elder,

00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:07.156
hurry up.

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:09.276
Read my grandson's future.

00:04:09.277 --> 00:04:10.156
Alright.

00:04:10.157 --> 00:04:11.956
Your Majesty, how could
an ordinary woman

00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:13.515
conceive a dragon child so easily?

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.195
What Prince Shang said is true.

00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:18.276
Princess Liluo
isn't the Wujing Saintess.

00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:20.075
Feng Zhilou is the real one.

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:21.075
Fei Yuan,

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.716
don't try to mislead us.

00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:26.116
An ordinary woman
can bear a dragon child too.

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:28.156
It's just that when the child is born,

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.437
both mother and child are likely to die.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.877
Until the child is born,

00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:35.356
nothing is certain.

00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:36.275
Your Majesty,

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.476
Prince Shang is barely holding on.

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:39.796
I beg the sanctuary to show mercy

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:42.317
and save Prince Shang and his child.

00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:44.916
We're willing to risk our life

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:47.437
to plead for Prince Shang
and Feng Zhilou.

00:04:47.677 --> 00:04:48.635
Your Majesty,

00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:51.195
even if you hold a grudge
against Feng Zhilou,

00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:54.916
we can't leave Prince Shang
and his child in the mortal realm.

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:57.317
We'll go with you to the mortal realm.

00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:16.315
No matter what,

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.877
bring Shang back.

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:20.476
I want to hear him explain everything.

00:05:33.877 --> 00:05:34.836
Follow me.

00:05:34.997 --> 00:05:36.236
They should be over there.

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:38.036
You must capture them for me.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:38.877
Hurry up.

00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:39.797
Keep up.

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:42.635
You two, search over there.

00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:43.636
Yes.

00:05:45.117 --> 00:05:46.076
Let's go. Hurry up.

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:00.636
Search carefully.

00:06:00.716 --> 00:06:01.956
Yes.

00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:07.156
Nothing.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.317
Nothing here either.

00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:10.836
Nothing.

00:06:19.716 --> 00:06:20.476
Keep looking.

00:06:20.477 --> 00:06:22.237
You must find Yue, Feng Zhilou

00:06:22.276 --> 00:06:23.877
and Prince Shang.

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:25.556
They couldn't have run far.

00:06:25.557 --> 00:06:26.437
Yes.

00:06:28.156 --> 00:06:30.116
I'm a nine-hundred-year-old
flood dragon.

00:06:30.117 --> 00:06:31.715
Mortals like you

00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:34.117
will never find the barrier I set.

00:06:39.797 --> 00:06:42.917
Zhilou and Prince Shang, please be safe.

00:06:43.877 --> 00:06:44.917
Chu Moshang,

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:47.276
the child and I need you.

00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:49.636
You have to wake up.

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:52.276
You think I'll remember you forever?

00:06:53.836 --> 00:06:55.197
Let me tell you.

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:57.437
That's not going to happen.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.636
Your sigil,

00:07:00.877 --> 00:07:02.317
your heart-guard scale,

00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:04.237
your Icebound Sword,

00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:06.516
everything that belongs to you...

00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:08.357
If you die,

00:07:08.677 --> 00:07:10.357
I'll throw them all away.

00:07:10.677 --> 00:07:12.117
I won't keep anything.

00:07:12.357 --> 00:07:13.357
If

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:16.757
Fei Yuan and Bai Lu can't
bring back your dragon pearl,

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.877
I'll stay right here.

00:07:19.117 --> 00:07:20.797
I'll stay by your side.

00:07:20.997 --> 00:07:22.917
I'll stay with you

00:07:23.597 --> 00:07:25.395
until our child is born.

00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:27.676
Then I'll use my own death

00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:28.796
to tear off this cursed sigil

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:30.317
and give it back to you.

00:07:34.877 --> 00:07:36.476
You have to wake up.

00:07:36.997 --> 00:07:38.997
You're the Dragon God.

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:40.437
Every creature in this world

00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:42.317
needs your protection.

00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:33.036
Zhilou,

00:08:33.276 --> 00:08:34.635
what you're seeing now

00:08:34.636 --> 00:08:35.836
is my soul.

00:08:36.396 --> 00:08:38.476
The heart-guard scale holds
a fragment of my soul.

00:08:38.516 --> 00:08:39.917
That's how I can appear before you.

00:08:40.156 --> 00:08:41.037
But

00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:43.317
I can only stay for a moment.

00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:44.917
Chu Moshang,

00:08:45.997 --> 00:08:47.637
I know everything

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:49.076
you've done for me.

00:08:49.477 --> 00:08:50.836
Why are you so foolish?

00:08:51.276 --> 00:08:52.956
You gave me every precious thing

00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:53.996
you have.

00:08:53.997 --> 00:08:55.596
Ever since I was born,

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:57.876
there's been only one voice in my ear.

00:08:58.396 --> 00:08:59.917
As the Dragon Prince,

00:09:00.357 --> 00:09:01.716
the heir to the sanctuary

00:09:01.717 --> 00:09:03.037
and to the Dragon King,

00:09:03.837 --> 00:09:05.716
I had to become stronger.

00:09:05.717 --> 00:09:07.596
Only with enough power

00:09:08.117 --> 00:09:10.637
could I protect the sanctuary
and the mortal realm.

00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:13.317
That duty was carved into my bones.

00:09:14.036 --> 00:09:14.836
I never

00:09:15.997 --> 00:09:17.716
complained about it.

00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:19.317
I never gave up.

00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:21.076
I never questioned it

00:09:23.276 --> 00:09:24.197
until I met you.

00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:26.716
It's almost funny.

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:28.035
To everyone else,

00:09:28.036 --> 00:09:30.956
the high and mighty,
all-powerful Dragon God

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.116
is nothing more than a man
betrayed by his own family,

00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:36.356
tortured by the Yang poison,

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:39.520
and a pitiful wretch
who has disappointed his father.

00:09:39.556 --> 00:09:40.917
But it was those moments

00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:43.876
of weakness and pain

00:09:44.997 --> 00:09:46.397
that made me feel

00:09:46.957 --> 00:09:48.517
truly alive.

00:09:49.117 --> 00:09:50.356
Thank you, Zhilou.

00:09:51.036 --> 00:09:52.677
You're the one who showed me

00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:54.397
that I can protect the world

00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:57.157
yet still fail to protect myself.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.037
I regret nothing.

00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:00.996
Everything I've done

00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:02.797
was to keep you safe.

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:04.277
Take our child

00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:06.756
and live a good life.

00:10:07.597 --> 00:10:09.157
If only one of us

00:10:09.477 --> 00:10:11.037
could survive,

00:10:11.117 --> 00:10:12.397
I want it to be you.

00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:14.116
That's why

00:10:14.556 --> 00:10:16.517
I gave you the heart-guard scale.

00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:23.596
It feels strange

00:10:25.237 --> 00:10:26.716
to see myself like this.

00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:33.197
Even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:36.157
I won't give up.

00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:52.199
Let's think about something happy.

♪The rust-stained sword

I was thinking

00:10:57.796 --> 00:10:59.799
that once everything is resolved,

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.037
we could go back
to the Feng Manor together.

00:11:03.477 --> 00:11:04.596
If you plan

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:06.611
to take the child back to the sanctuary,

00:11:06.612 --> 00:11:08.596
♪Memories rise and fall,

00:11:08.597 --> 00:11:10.336

♪In a dream, I see him

00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:16.277
I hope he can be like you,

living at the Feng Manor,

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:19.437
free,

00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:20.956
growing up wild and strong.

00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:22.699
More than having a son,

00:11:23.636 --> 00:11:25.116
I actually hope for a daughter.

00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:26.677
I believe you'd

00:11:27.237 --> 00:11:28.716
help her grow into someone

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:30.917
extraordinary at the sanctuary.

00:11:31.396 --> 00:11:31.911
Alright.

00:11:31.912 --> 00:11:35.170
♪Oaths once strong like mountains,

00:11:36.156 --> 00:11:37.277
Chu Moshang,

00:11:37.877 --> 00:11:41.499
what happens to a Dragon after death?

00:11:42.117 --> 00:11:43.574

I see.

00:11:49.477 --> 00:11:51.637
Human lives are short.

00:11:52.916 --> 00:11:54.536
In the end, we all return to dust.

00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:58.596
We're not so different.

00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:02.557
In the near future,

00:12:05.036 --> 00:12:07.716
we'll meet again

00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:09.956
somewhere close.

00:12:14.237 --> 00:12:15.677

To possess such skill
at such a young age,

00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:08.277
you're truly incredible.

00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:10.275
Xiaoyu studied medicine
under Physician Chu.

00:13:10.276 --> 00:13:12.560
She's more than qualified to be
the head of the apothecary.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.476
I remember the only person
in Wujing City

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.716
with such skill was Physician Chu.

00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:19.836
He's a stubborn old man.

00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:20.836
He always said

00:13:20.837 --> 00:13:23.716
he'd only pass down his craft
to someone he approved of.

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:25.716
He clearly made the right choice.

00:13:28.636 --> 00:13:30.277
I miss Zhilou.

00:13:30.717 --> 00:13:33.197
I want to hold her like this every day.

00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:34.476
When you see her again,

00:13:34.597 --> 00:13:36.157
you'll be able to hold her
just like this.

00:13:39.556 --> 00:13:40.397
Xiaoyu,

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:41.876
it's almost time.

00:13:41.877 --> 00:13:43.037
We have to go.

00:13:46.516 --> 00:13:48.756
Zhilou hasn't visited me lately.

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.116
Be honest with me.

00:13:51.717 --> 00:13:53.637
Is she in danger?

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:03.517
Ms. Yue,

00:14:03.957 --> 00:14:06.157
Zhilou and Prince Shang love each other.

00:14:06.957 --> 00:14:09.716
But because Liluo
was promised to him first,

00:14:10.597 --> 00:14:12.515
Prince Shang gave up
his Dragon God power

00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:14.476
and his dragon pearl to be with Zhilou.

00:14:15.197 --> 00:14:16.956
Recently he was injured
during an ambush.

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.917
We're waiting for them to return too.

00:14:19.396 --> 00:14:20.435
Do you know why Liluo

00:14:20.436 --> 00:14:22.397
was able to become the Wujing Saintess?

00:14:23.357 --> 00:14:24.517
Zhilou and I

00:14:24.756 --> 00:14:26.797
are the descendants
of the Wujing Saintess.

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:28.637
The Feng Manor

00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:30.716
is her homeland.

00:14:31.317 --> 00:14:34.037
No matter what trick your mother pulled,

00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:36.317
Zhilou and Prince Shang

00:14:36.436 --> 00:14:38.397
still found each other
at the Feng Manor.

00:14:38.717 --> 00:14:40.437
It's fate.

00:14:41.077 --> 00:14:42.836
They're a match made in heaven.

00:14:44.796 --> 00:14:46.076
I'm sorry, Ms. Yue.

00:14:46.597 --> 00:14:47.716
I don't blame you.

00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:49.476
I'm alright.

00:14:49.837 --> 00:14:51.797
Whatever happens between Zhilou
and Prince Shang

00:14:51.997 --> 00:14:53.677
is written by destiny.

00:14:54.077 --> 00:14:55.435
Every hardship they face

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:57.277
is a trial they must overcome.

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.035
Only by surviving them

00:14:59.036 --> 00:15:01.236
can they begin anew.

00:15:01.717 --> 00:15:03.996
The Dragon God and the Wujing Saintess

00:15:04.396 --> 00:15:05.716
will protect them.

00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:06.795
Back then,

00:15:06.796 --> 00:15:07.915
I let my role as a mother

00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:09.917
cloud my judgment.

00:15:11.837 --> 00:15:14.716
How did I end up
with a daughter like Liluo?

00:15:31.237 --> 00:15:32.880
I've caused you so much trouble, Xiaoyu.

00:15:40.877 --> 00:15:41.836
Xiaoyu,

00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:44.277
your willingness to look after me

00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:45.876
touches me deeply.

00:15:46.636 --> 00:15:48.116
Even though I can't see you well,

00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:50.996
I can feel you here with me.

00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:52.596
Thank you

00:15:52.957 --> 00:15:54.557
for being part of my life.
