00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:09.781
Three unidentified Espers
have been confirmed.

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:11.991
The first is…

00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:13.910
a university student named Ichimatsu.

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:16.329
His Esper power is dehydration.

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:17.372
Dehydration attack!

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.792
He can force tears
and mucus out of others,

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.293
but it's not very useful.

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:24.212
Be grateful I spared your lower half!

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:27.382
The second unidentified Esper,

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:31.177
a high schooler named Shion.
His Esper power is static electricity.

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:33.304
-The dangerous ones are you villains!
-With his youth, the output is immense

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:34.764
and highly versatile.

00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:37.225
He's an Esper I'd like to recruit.

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:40.687
The third unidentified Esper,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.981
a woman known as Kujo.

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:45.692
Her car was a rental,
and her true identity remains unknown.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.902
Her Esper power is sonic waves.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.238
Troublesome, yes,

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.031
-but manageable.
-You okay?

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.992
As long as you shut it out.

00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:57.370
They've been targeting

00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:59.914
Nonamare for some time now.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.543
Yet my subordinates

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:06.087
kept it from me.

00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:08.423
Can I come again?

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:10.675
Please give me psychic powers too!

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:11.551
Let's keep this between us.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.389
A most serious situation.

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:20.810
Ichimatsu will later

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:25.523
become Dr. Ichimatsu.
That can't be a coincidence.

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:30.737
And one more person.

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:33.865
A mysterious man dressed in white.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.118
No photos exist of him.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.495
He seemed older than me.

00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:42.290
He had a stern, imposing attitude.

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:44.459
He wore all white, and…

00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:46.794
His head was perfectly smooth.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:50.423
He stood before me
and pointed at them, one by one.

00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:57.805
He made them disappear
and then vanished himself.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.769
Who is that Esper,
and where did he come from?

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.192
And there's another issue.

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:15.240
Shiki has taken the E-Capsule.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.369
Shiki becoming an Esper
wasn't in the plan,

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.537
obviously.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.749
I need to check her condition myself.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.585
That is why I decided to meet her.

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:28.920
Boss.

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.015
Nice to meet you. I'm Shiki.

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:45.853
I'm Kizashi. Pleased to meet you.

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:50.400
Boss said she's the daughter of a friend

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:52.568
and asked us to look after her.

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.155
Bunta, wait outside.

00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:58.324
Yes, sir.

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:07.875
Shiki.

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:12.505
You accidentally consumed
the company's supply capsule.

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:14.090
That's fine.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:16.259
It was Bunta's oversight.

00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:18.845
I'm sorry.

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:21.014
If you refrain
from taking any more capsules,

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:23.516
the Esper state will eventually fade.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:26.561
That's kind of a waste, isn't it?

00:03:29.397 --> 00:03:30.690
I'm sorry.

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:32.108
Now that you're an Esper,

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:34.986
you must follow our rules.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:39.157
No one outside must know your identity.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.408
Understood.

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:42.327
That was the rule…

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.913
until everyone started breaking it.

00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:49.667
Exposing their powers, not reporting,
and doing as they please!

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:58.885
Anyway, those are the rules.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.012
Yes.

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:02.263
And one more.

00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:03.931
Non Amare.

00:04:04.974 --> 00:04:06.934
You must not fall in love.

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.691
So, that was your first time
meeting the boss?

00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:19.197
-I thought you two knew each other.
-Nope.

00:04:19.697 --> 00:04:20.656
It was my first time.

00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:24.410
But…

00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:27.663
Has Kizashi ever been on TV or something?

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:30.291
No idea.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:33.336
I saw Shiki today.

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:36.923
We exchanged greetings.

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.176
I explained the rules to her.

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:45.473
Non Amare.

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.142
That's impossible.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.603
I love my husband.

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.985
I love Bunty,
so that rule won't work for me.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.699
What should I do?

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:08.162
I see.

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:12.208
I'll make an exception.

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:14.961
Thank you.

00:05:17.296 --> 00:05:20.758
Why can't we love someone?

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:23.553
Even idols don't have that rule anymore.

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:28.099
Why is there a rule

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:29.100
to not love someone?

00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:32.145
But these days, even idols…

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:43.573
Have I met you before?

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:52.832
No. This is our first time meeting.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.334
Right…Of course.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.473
Did he remind you of someone?

00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:13.102
Just my imagination.

00:06:14.854 --> 00:06:18.107
Mistaking him like that is ridiculous.
They don't even look alike.

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:20.693
That dream doesn't make sense anyway.

00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:23.196
Dream?

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:26.866
Sorry.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.869
No, it's fine. There's nothing to hide.

00:06:34.123 --> 00:06:38.252
Remember the dream
I told you about where you died?

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:39.170
‎Yeah.

00:06:40.213 --> 00:06:43.007
You didn't die. You were alive.

00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:46.469
I see.

00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:51.682
Either way, it's just a weird dream.

00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:57.563
Fortunately,

00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:00.441
Shiki…

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.819
didn't remember me.

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:36.102
-Sorry for the wait!
-Oh!

00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:37.186
-Hi!
-Hey!

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.688
-Hi!
-Hey!

00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:40.439
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

00:07:42.275 --> 00:07:44.777
Can't believe you got married, Shiki.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.112
Right?

00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:48.281
So, no more clingy,
high-maintenance Shiki?

00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:49.198
Nope.

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:52.118
I got married, but still clingy.

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:57.039
We weren't invited to your wedding.

00:07:57.623 --> 00:07:59.500
-Right?
-Nope.

00:07:59.584 --> 00:08:03.879
It was just a photo wedding. You remember
the New Year's card I sent, right?

00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:05.256
-Did you get one?
-No.

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:08.342
Wait. You all just didn't bother.

00:08:09.093 --> 00:08:10.803
What does your husband do?

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:14.015
Bunty is a handyman.

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:15.850
-Bunty?
-A handyman?

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:18.144
He used to be in sales…

00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:21.230
Well, when we met, he was…

00:08:21.314 --> 00:08:23.065
DRY CLEANERS

00:08:31.574 --> 00:08:32.491
So,

00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:34.035
what did he say when he proposed?

00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:35.328
-I want to hear it.
-Yeah.

00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:36.537
It was simple.

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:38.539
On the night of the fireworks…

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:41.000
What did you just say?

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.255
Will you marry me?

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:56.223
Was it too soon?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.854
-Shiki?
-Hey.

00:09:02.438 --> 00:09:06.776
Oh, sorry. I've been weird lately.

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:08.444
-You've always been weird.
-Yeah.

00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:11.322
I keep seeing someone

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:14.492
in my dreams or visions.

00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:16.035
The same man shows up.

00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:19.038
-A man, huh?
-Your type?

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:21.123
-A secret crush?
-No.

00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:25.836
Like a cold, boring guy.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.755
Once, Junji Takada appeared in my dream.

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:29.173
-That happens.
-Yeah?

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:30.883
-Right?
-There's no deep meaning, right?

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:32.468
-No, right?
-It happens.

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:53.239
I see…

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:01.956
The bug in Takoppi's place
went dead. No sound at all.

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:04.333
I guess they noticed.

00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:08.671
What about Ai? Any word?

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.882
No response to my calls.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.969
What now?

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:17.304
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:10:17.388 --> 00:10:20.474
I could only carry two cones,
so I'm going to grab mine.

00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:26.564
Did you ask him to do that?

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:30.568
The kid's acting all bubbly.

00:10:36.282 --> 00:10:37.825
You don't think

00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:42.747
we look like a couple right now?

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:43.789
What? Ew.

00:10:43.873 --> 00:10:45.624
This isn't good.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:47.710
If my girlfriend saw us, I'd be dead.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.755
I'm so done with this!

00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:53.340
-I want to quit.
-Same here.

00:10:57.928 --> 00:10:59.138
Is your girlfriend watching?

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.015
-She's in Sendai.
-What?

00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:04.810
My senpai is calling for me.

00:11:06.145 --> 00:11:07.730
Tell Shion thanks for the ice cream.

00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:13.110
-Hey, where are you going?
-I'm still a student, and I need credits.

00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:15.613
If I fail another year,
I'm screwed. Sorry.

00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:16.989
Hey!

00:11:22.536 --> 00:11:26.540
Even I wish this was all just a dream.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.502
He came!

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:31.086
He did!

00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:34.381
You told me to come,
so don't act surprised.

00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:39.011
Glad you came.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.931
-Let go!
-Have some.

00:11:42.014 --> 00:11:43.474
-It's good.
-It's good.

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:44.683
It's good.

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:52.566
Nothing weird inside, right?

00:11:53.734 --> 00:11:55.277
Just dead octopus.

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:02.535
Is it good?

00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:07.540
That's right. It's good, huh?

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:12.545
It's becoming my comfort food.

00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:16.382
Who's your boss?

00:12:17.007 --> 00:12:19.009
-Ai.
-Ai?

00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:24.431
That white guy is Ai?

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:28.269
No. Ai's not like that.

00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:29.645
Your long-distance girlfriend?

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:33.357
Also no. Why do you even know that?

00:12:35.484 --> 00:12:38.237
Then, what did you mean back then?

00:12:38.737 --> 00:12:40.114
Let go!

00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:42.408
Ten million people will die
because of you!

00:12:43.409 --> 00:12:46.287
Ten million people will die because of me?

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:52.293
Maybe not directly you,

00:12:54.378 --> 00:12:56.797
but your boss, Kizashi.

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:01.510
Kizashi's orders will make it happen,
so it's the same.

00:13:01.594 --> 00:13:03.012
How can you be so sure?

00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:07.057
I can't say who Ai is,

00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:11.604
but Ai hacked
into Kizashi's communications.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:15.649
Ai was detected and locked out

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:21.864
but got Kizashi's simulation data.

00:13:23.198 --> 00:13:24.617
Simulation?

00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:28.912
He used big data to model

00:13:28.996 --> 00:13:32.875
how building certain junctions
could reshape the future.

00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:35.461
As a result,

00:13:36.128 --> 00:13:39.590
in the future that Kizashi seeks…

00:13:40.215 --> 00:13:42.509
In that future,
ten million people will die.

00:13:43.302 --> 00:13:44.720
That's the future Ai saw.

00:13:46.764 --> 00:13:48.599
You guys are helping him.

00:13:49.683 --> 00:13:50.643
He's using you.

00:13:55.022 --> 00:13:58.651
We're saving the world.

00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:03.072
Our mission is to save 10,000 lives
ten years from now.

00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:05.407
That's what the missions are for.

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:08.577
-We--
-That's a lie.

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.372
That's a lie.

00:14:17.086 --> 00:14:18.587
This conversation is going nowhere.

00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:24.927
FLOWER SHOP

00:14:28.722 --> 00:14:30.099
Can we talk for a bit?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.372
You have a son that old?

00:14:57.793 --> 00:15:00.045
There may be a misunderstanding
between you guys,

00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:04.758
but we've got nothing to hide.
So, just stay calm.

00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:09.805
He's being used.

00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:11.432
Huh?

00:15:13.517 --> 00:15:15.894
Shion is being manipulated.

00:15:15.978 --> 00:15:18.647
It might be safer
to bring him to our side.

00:15:20.858 --> 00:15:22.067
How?

00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:25.946
If you tell him the truth.

00:15:26.613 --> 00:15:27.948
That you're his father.

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:30.951
That would

00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:33.370
reach his heart.

00:15:41.295 --> 00:15:45.007
Ohsuke, what did you just do?

00:15:48.177 --> 00:15:49.887
Nothing… I didn't do anything.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.664
A pickling stone?

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:19.249
For my birthday?

00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:21.919
You said you wanted one.

00:16:22.002 --> 00:16:24.421
I said I wanted to pickle cabbage.

00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:26.256
Not very romantic, though.

00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:27.966
Here.

00:16:30.594 --> 00:16:31.470
That was close!

00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:33.013
Please use it.

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:34.389
Thanks.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.486
What are you pickling this time?

00:16:51.615 --> 00:16:54.743
You gave me this, right?

00:16:58.747 --> 00:17:00.165
Who else would it be?

00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:02.709
It has to be me.

00:17:05.796 --> 00:17:07.047
Right.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.853
Keeping up a lie is exhausting.

00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:28.735
I'll keep it up, no excuses.

00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:31.446
I'll hide it to the end. Don't worry.

00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:38.287
Maybe telling the truth…

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.622
is an option too.

00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:46.170
I might've been overthinking it.

00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:48.422
Go ahead and tell her.

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:53.886
Tell Shiki the truth.

00:17:54.678 --> 00:17:57.556
Say you're not really her husband,
but you love her.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.602
Her husband's dead anyway.

00:18:02.352 --> 00:18:05.272
He's not even competition.

00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:08.859
You've already won.

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:14.364
Hello.

00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:16.450
You're late.

00:18:17.242 --> 00:18:19.536
We hurried, believe it or not.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.330
You're super late!

00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:25.000
I was in the middle
of drying Furuta's shell, you know.

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.668
Sorry, despite your busy schedule.

00:18:27.252 --> 00:18:28.629
So, what did you want to discuss?

00:18:30.422 --> 00:18:31.590
Actually…

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.092
Ichimatsu told me this.

00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:36.803
Because of our missions,

00:18:37.387 --> 00:18:38.639
ten years from now,

00:18:39.348 --> 00:18:41.433
we will cause ten million deaths.

00:18:43.268 --> 00:18:46.897
But the boss once told me this

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.482
and said it was confidential.

00:18:48.565 --> 00:18:50.400
Ten years from now,

00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.655
10,000 people will die.
A major catastrophe will occur.

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.490
I want…

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.493
to stop it.

00:19:00.244 --> 00:19:01.995
Our mission

00:19:02.788 --> 00:19:05.290
is to save 10,000 lives.

00:19:08.543 --> 00:19:11.880
According to Ichimatsu,
we are being deceived.

00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:15.050
He says we're working for the wrong side.

00:19:15.133 --> 00:19:18.553
If we continue our missions,
ten million people will die.

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:22.140
We're not saving,
but rather people will die.

00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:29.314
Boss is saying we will save 10,000 people.

00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:32.818
But Ichimatsu says
ten million people will die.

00:19:34.361 --> 00:19:35.779
Who should I believe?

00:19:35.862 --> 00:19:38.240
-Of course, the boss!
-Duh!

00:19:38.323 --> 00:19:39.658
What are you talking about?

00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:41.702
-You don't even need to think.
-Right.

00:19:41.785 --> 00:19:44.413
-But--
-Why do you think Ichimatsu is correct?

00:19:44.496 --> 00:19:46.707
Yeah. He's a traitor.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.125
Well…

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:51.169
If ten million people die because of me…

00:19:51.253 --> 00:19:52.921
How can you fall for that?

00:19:54.006 --> 00:19:55.090
I'm sorry.

00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:57.217
Did you exchange contact information?

00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:03.557
-You did?
-What is he? Your friend?

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.309
-Well…
-What's with this guy?

00:20:05.392 --> 00:20:06.268
You traitor!

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:12.357
Then, let's talk it out.

00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:15.235
-Everyone from both sides together.
-Huh?

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.820
Don't drag Shion into this.

00:20:16.903 --> 00:20:17.946
Then without him.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.657
But he doesn't know
that he's Ohsuke's son.

00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:24.619
Wouldn't it be weird to exclude just him?

00:20:25.203 --> 00:20:28.040
Say it's because he's a high schooler,
so he shouldn't be involved.

00:20:28.123 --> 00:20:30.751
-Mrs. Enjaku, I'll bloom flowers for you!
-Not now.

00:20:30.834 --> 00:20:33.045
So, Shion stays out.

00:20:33.128 --> 00:20:35.505
Kujo, the white man,
and Ichimatsu. Those three.

00:20:35.589 --> 00:20:38.008
We'll have four.
So, it'll be four versus three.

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:41.428
If I sit out, it'll be even.
Three versus three.

00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:42.846
I'll hide and watch from afar.

00:20:42.929 --> 00:20:45.807
-That white guy might do something again.
-Yeah.

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:48.894
-Bunta, contact Ichimatsu.
-Yes.

00:20:54.399 --> 00:20:56.693
-This looks kind of like a date.
-Not even close.

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:09.164
Why at the university?

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.166
It's their request.

00:21:13.668 --> 00:21:15.170
Hey. Let's put these together.

00:21:15.921 --> 00:21:17.130
Yeah…

00:21:17.214 --> 00:21:19.341
-One, two!
-One, two!

00:21:20.884 --> 00:21:22.094
Sorry, I'm late.

00:21:22.761 --> 00:21:23.845
Then arrange this.

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:28.558
One, two.

00:21:28.642 --> 00:21:29.476
They're here.

00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:32.687
-Just you two?
-You got a problem?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.651
Wait, so nobody ordered anything?

00:21:39.444 --> 00:21:41.738
You guys aren't the students here,
you know?

00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:43.156
Shouldn't you get us something?

00:21:44.324 --> 00:21:46.910
Oh, that's right.
Then I'll go buy something…

00:21:47.911 --> 00:21:48.787
Where do I buy it?

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.622
Are you guys having fun down there?

00:21:52.457 --> 00:21:53.959
What kind of meeting is this?

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:56.461
They looked good. Eat some, you two.

00:21:56.545 --> 00:21:58.171
Let's eat.

00:22:01.258 --> 00:22:02.592
Where's the white guy?

00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:04.719
He's not one of us.

00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:07.472
-What?
-But he disappeared with you, right?

00:22:07.556 --> 00:22:08.932
We don't know either.

00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:12.561
When we noticed, everyone was gone.

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:21.069
The white man was gone too.

00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:22.821
We had no idea

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:26.366
what happened, so we just went home.

00:22:31.663 --> 00:22:33.874
Maybe you're the one who helped him?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.002
While we were out cold,

00:22:37.085 --> 00:22:39.880
you dumped the case
with the virus into the sea.

00:22:40.547 --> 00:22:42.632
And because of that, ten million will die.

00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:46.094
That case was empty.

00:22:46.178 --> 00:22:48.471
-Empty?
-There was no virus inside.

00:22:48.555 --> 00:22:50.891
We don't understand it either.

00:22:52.642 --> 00:22:55.604
Then maybe Kizashi set it up?

00:22:57.272 --> 00:22:58.732
Makes sense.

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:02.277
He tricked even his own team
and used us all to stage a fake mission.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.528
He made us fight for the case.

00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:06.656
The boss didn't know it was empty.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.533
That happens.
Missions aren't always perfect.

00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:09.868
There it is again. Mission, huh?

00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:16.416
I used to have a classmate named Yanagi.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.586
She was top of our class and brilliant.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.839
She suddenly showed up
at my company one day.

00:23:31.848 --> 00:23:33.350
What are you listening to?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.311
Your old band, Entropy Girls.

00:23:36.394 --> 00:23:40.565
What? You came
to dig up my high school shame?

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:42.984
-It was a good band.
-Stop it.

00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:48.406
Why are you here?

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.120
I've been doing some side work lately,
something kind of unusual.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.958
Missions.

00:23:58.541 --> 00:24:00.001
My job is to complete missions.

00:24:02.254 --> 00:24:03.922
It seems there were
several part-time workers.

00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:05.757
Each of them had a mission.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.884
Stock trading, real estate deals.

00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:10.804
Someone even made machines
for an optics company.

00:24:11.429 --> 00:24:13.598
The pharma division had two teams.

00:24:14.557 --> 00:24:16.476
Yanagi was in Team A.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:17.894
Their mission

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.440
was to create a drug
that could turn people into Espers.

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:28.947
The employer sent over the drug's formula.

00:24:29.531 --> 00:24:32.867
I'd never seen that synthesis method.
Strange ingredients, too.

00:24:33.702 --> 00:24:37.080
Whatever we lacked, the other
part-timers got it from their missions.

00:24:38.623 --> 00:24:39.791
What?

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:43.920
A drug that makes you an Esper?

00:24:46.381 --> 00:24:48.633
You liked meat, didn't you, Kujo?

00:24:55.932 --> 00:24:56.850
How does it smell?

00:25:03.565 --> 00:25:05.233
The smell of grilled meat?

00:25:05.984 --> 00:25:07.152
It's my Esper ability.

00:25:07.736 --> 00:25:09.112
I can produce just a little smell.

00:25:09.195 --> 00:25:10.697
Just smell? Not the real thing?

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.115
Of course not.

00:25:12.198 --> 00:25:15.702
So, all it does is make people hungry?
Totally useless.

00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:18.413
Right. It's completely useless.

00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:20.290
What kind of drug is that?

00:25:24.252 --> 00:25:26.421
What about this smell? Recognize it?

00:25:39.142 --> 00:25:40.435
Citrus.

00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:45.106
Like citrus shampoo.

00:25:46.649 --> 00:25:47.609
Bingo.

00:25:49.069 --> 00:25:52.405
You started using it because I did.

00:25:53.615 --> 00:25:55.283
Back then, we both smelled the same.

00:25:58.787 --> 00:26:01.414
We've both switched shampoos since, huh?

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:13.426
You want me to hold on to this?

00:26:14.469 --> 00:26:15.720
I'll come get it when it's all over.

00:26:18.807 --> 00:26:20.308
-Wait…
-See you.

00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:23.853
I wanted to ask her a million questions,

00:26:24.354 --> 00:26:26.189
but I just did as told.

00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:32.612
A few days later, I got a call…

00:26:33.696 --> 00:26:34.906
from the police.

00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:48.420
It's her.

00:26:49.629 --> 00:26:51.005
Yanagi.

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:06.438
Her body…

00:27:08.106 --> 00:27:10.024
smelled of citrus.

00:27:32.046 --> 00:27:36.342
TO KUJO

00:27:51.983 --> 00:27:54.402
If you're reading this,

00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:57.363
it means I'm dead.

00:27:57.947 --> 00:27:58.865
LETTER TO KUJO

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:02.035
All my teammates are dead too.
They were killed.

00:28:03.161 --> 00:28:05.413
I don't know which Esper did it.

00:28:07.624 --> 00:28:09.292
This case is for insurance.

00:28:10.877 --> 00:28:12.003
Hide it.

00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:14.839
Use it to beg for your life
if you have to.

00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:18.259
If you fail,

00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:22.222
destroy it all.

00:28:23.723 --> 00:28:26.726
And forget about me.

00:28:29.604 --> 00:28:31.105
Our employer said

00:28:31.773 --> 00:28:34.359
they were just creating "Kizashi".

00:28:36.277 --> 00:28:37.820
That people get lost easily

00:28:38.363 --> 00:28:40.365
if the sign or "kizashi" is strong enough.

00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:44.661
Even if it leads the wrong way.

00:28:58.591 --> 00:28:59.676
Are you listening?

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.095
Of course, we were.

00:29:02.637 --> 00:29:05.181
It just suddenly got really heavy.

00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:07.183
Like a kids' comic turning serious.

00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:09.018
Hey, I'm being serious!

00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:11.354
Stop eating fries!

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.942
We're just not used to big-picture stuff.

00:29:17.193 --> 00:29:18.278
Our world's just a bit smaller.

00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:23.032
Yanagi's employer was named Kizashi.

00:29:24.993 --> 00:29:26.619
That's your boss, isn't it?

00:29:27.745 --> 00:29:29.914
-Our boss is a good man!
-That's right.

00:29:30.999 --> 00:29:33.084
Good or bad doesn't matter!
Look at what he's done!

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.463
Who is Kizashi? What's his real name?
What kind of Esper is he?

00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:43.094
Hitting the table was the signal.

00:29:53.479 --> 00:29:54.981
Static electricity?

00:29:55.064 --> 00:29:56.566
Is Shion here?

00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:02.906
This room is saturated
with Shion's static charge.

00:30:03.531 --> 00:30:06.993
A high-density, unstable field of energy.

00:30:07.076 --> 00:30:10.705
If I release a perfectly tuned
ultrasonic wave matching this frequency,

00:30:10.788 --> 00:30:12.874
it'll trigger molecular resonance,

00:30:12.957 --> 00:30:15.001
breaking bonds and releasing energy.

00:30:15.877 --> 00:30:17.962
In other words,
an acoustic resonance explosion.

00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:19.839
Explosion?

00:30:19.923 --> 00:30:21.549
You're gonna blow yourself up?

00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:25.094
The explosion will spread
from this table outward.

00:30:26.137 --> 00:30:28.264
The only ones who'll die
are everyone except us.

00:30:29.515 --> 00:30:32.352
Talk. Kizashi's identity,
his real name, his Esper power!

00:30:32.435 --> 00:30:34.312
-We don't know!
-We don't know!

00:30:34.896 --> 00:30:37.649
Then I've got no choice.

00:30:50.912 --> 00:30:52.997
Do you know that assault is a crime?

00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:54.582
I was just gonna blow them away a bit!

00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:57.377
-A little can go too far!
-Let go of me…

00:31:05.635 --> 00:31:07.261
-Huh?
-What? It's not sticking anymore.

00:31:07.345 --> 00:31:08.262
The static's gone.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.441
Watch out.

00:31:21.484 --> 00:31:24.904
If you change your mind, tell Ichimatsu.

00:31:29.492 --> 00:31:31.536
I'm so sorry about this. Excuse me.

00:31:39.544 --> 00:31:41.587
My brain's blank right now.

00:31:44.048 --> 00:31:46.426
Hey, if I used one of these,

00:31:47.385 --> 00:31:48.636
could they have stopped her?

00:31:49.512 --> 00:31:52.223
Using electromagnetic or ultrasonic
jammers might've made it worse.

00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:53.558
Sorry, I'll go ahead.

00:31:54.726 --> 00:31:56.019
Take care of these, okay?

00:32:02.233 --> 00:32:06.154
How many Espers like us
do you think there are?

00:32:06.237 --> 00:32:08.364
I always thought we were the only ones.

00:32:09.657 --> 00:32:12.285
She said the Espers were all killed.
What do you make of that?

00:32:14.328 --> 00:32:15.580
Bunta,

00:32:16.247 --> 00:32:18.291
Hanzo, Ohsuke…

00:32:19.208 --> 00:32:21.502
You've all been keeping secrets.

00:32:23.046 --> 00:32:25.214
I can't trust anyone now.

00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:28.968
-We didn't mean any harm.
-Sooner or later,

00:32:29.927 --> 00:32:31.262
someone will betray us.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.348
No one will.

00:32:36.017 --> 00:32:37.435
Except you, Mrs. Enjaku.

00:32:38.686 --> 00:32:40.480
Please stay on my side.

00:32:45.485 --> 00:32:48.112
You'd believe her over the boss?

00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:50.031
She didn't sound like she was lying.

00:32:50.114 --> 00:32:52.575
I still think the boss is right.

00:32:57.914 --> 00:32:59.248
Kujo!

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:01.709
Kujo! I…

00:33:01.793 --> 00:33:03.503
can't handle killing anyone!

00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:05.213
What were you trying to do at my school?

00:33:05.296 --> 00:33:08.633
I screwed up. I should've put on
my headphones before shouting.

00:33:08.716 --> 00:33:11.803
Blasting myself with my own power
is pretty useless.

00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:13.721
Were you going to kill my friends?

00:33:15.348 --> 00:33:17.016
I was bluffing! Just to scare them.

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:20.103
It would've been just a tiny pop, at best.

00:33:20.853 --> 00:33:24.357
I almost called it
Sonic Resonance Detonation,

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.109
but it sounded too much like a band name.

00:33:26.943 --> 00:33:30.154
Stop playing around!

00:33:30.738 --> 00:33:32.824
My hands are drenched in sweat!

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.537
Kujo, sorry! The flower guy stopped me!

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.788
Figures.

00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:41.374
Any luck finding out
who Kizashi really is?

00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:43.042
Nope. Total miss.

00:33:43.709 --> 00:33:46.587
What the heck?

00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:55.263
The white man didn't show up.

00:33:55.805 --> 00:33:58.933
I asked the crows to take care of Kujo.

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:02.270
You knew about Ichimatsu,

00:34:02.937 --> 00:34:04.772
but you didn't report it.

00:34:06.691 --> 00:34:09.068
That's a serious violation.

00:34:09.819 --> 00:34:11.237
You're fired.

00:34:12.238 --> 00:34:15.408
That would end your current life.

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:21.664
I'll give you a chance.

00:34:23.374 --> 00:34:27.003
Find out who the enemy really is.

00:34:28.838 --> 00:34:31.591
I'll contact you
once I find Kujo's address.

00:34:32.758 --> 00:34:33.843
Goodbye.

00:34:33.926 --> 00:34:35.136
HANZO

00:35:08.586 --> 00:35:11.130
-Shiki!
-Yes?

00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:14.967
-Shiki!
-Congrats on six months with us!

00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:16.594
You've got ten days of paid leave now.

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:18.638
Take them anytime you like.

00:35:19.222 --> 00:35:20.973
Six months?

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:26.562
I've been working here
for over two years, haven't I?

00:35:27.313 --> 00:35:32.026
Well, it's always felt like
you've been here for years.

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:33.110
Yeah.

00:35:33.194 --> 00:35:36.072
You seemed to know where everything was,
every step of the job,

00:35:36.155 --> 00:35:38.241
without anyone telling you.

00:35:38.324 --> 00:35:41.160
Before six months ago,
you were at another shop, right?

00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:43.996
Another shop…

00:36:06.102 --> 00:36:07.270
I'm home.

00:36:10.398 --> 00:36:11.440
What's going on?

00:36:16.487 --> 00:36:17.488
Shiki!

00:36:19.573 --> 00:36:20.658
Shiki!

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:24.495
The photo's gone.

00:36:25.162 --> 00:36:26.247
Photo?

00:36:26.914 --> 00:36:28.249
From the photo wedding.

00:36:28.916 --> 00:36:32.086
We took pictures, remember?

00:36:32.169 --> 00:36:34.755
I wore the dress
and picked out your tuxedo.

00:36:36.382 --> 00:36:37.925
The photo's gone. I can't find it!

00:36:39.593 --> 00:36:40.553
Why?

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:46.434
It's nowhere! Why?!

00:36:53.357 --> 00:36:54.233
Here.

00:36:55.151 --> 00:36:56.527
Thank you.

00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:10.416
Fumito?

00:37:13.377 --> 00:37:14.253
Huh?

00:37:15.171 --> 00:37:16.714
You're Fumito.

00:37:18.674 --> 00:37:20.051
So, why do I call you Bunty?

00:37:35.983 --> 00:37:37.151
Fumito…

00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:40.071
Kizashi?

00:37:42.531 --> 00:37:45.534
No. That can't be.

00:37:58.214 --> 00:37:59.382
Bunty…

00:38:03.344 --> 00:38:05.721
You're Bunta, so that's why
you're Bunty, right?

00:38:10.393 --> 00:38:13.312
You're Bunty, right?

00:38:17.316 --> 00:38:19.235
Bunty…

00:38:21.112 --> 00:38:22.279
Bunty!

00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:26.325
Bunty!

00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:30.704
Bunty!

00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:33.999
Bunty!

00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:53.853
Sorry to come this late.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.105
It's fine.

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.526
What would you like to discuss?

00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:02.486
It's about Shiki.

00:39:06.615 --> 00:39:08.492
Her memory's unstable.

00:39:09.952 --> 00:39:11.078
She's confused.

00:39:12.913 --> 00:39:14.081
I don't know what to do.

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:16.709
And now?

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.503
She's in bed, exhausted from crying.

00:39:32.099 --> 00:39:33.225
Pickled plums.

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:35.478
Shiki made them.

00:39:38.105 --> 00:39:39.565
They're still salty,

00:39:40.524 --> 00:39:42.276
but she said they'll mellow with time.

00:39:44.361 --> 00:39:46.071
Shiki taught me that.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.454
Please. Have some.

00:40:04.298 --> 00:40:06.175
She used the pickling stone…

00:40:08.135 --> 00:40:09.553
that Fumito gave her.

00:40:12.973 --> 00:40:14.975
Her husband's not dead.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.562
You're her husband.

00:40:19.813 --> 00:40:21.565
Her Bunty, right?

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.447
Wait.

00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:48.926
You're an Esper?

00:40:50.803 --> 00:40:51.762
What type of Esper?

00:40:51.845 --> 00:40:53.556
I don't have a Esper.

00:41:05.776 --> 00:41:07.361
-A ghost?
-No.

00:41:08.153 --> 00:41:11.407
This is a 3D hologram.

00:41:12.408 --> 00:41:15.244
My real body exists in the future.

00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:21.875
-The future?
-The year 2055.

00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:25.754
Twenty fifty…?

00:41:25.838 --> 00:41:28.007
2055, to be exact.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.717
Thirty years from now.

00:41:33.762 --> 00:41:35.139
I see.

00:41:35.222 --> 00:41:37.516
Time machines don't exist,

00:41:38.183 --> 00:41:40.936
but we discovered a way
to send data to the past.

00:41:42.438 --> 00:41:46.358
Think of it like
remote communication in your time.

00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:50.154
I'm sorry, but I've officially lost track

00:41:51.614 --> 00:41:53.365
of this conversation.

00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:03.292
No, not yet.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.087
Just get whatever.

00:42:07.171 --> 00:42:09.173
You could eat alone, you know.

00:42:10.382 --> 00:42:13.802
Okay, got it. Bye.

00:42:21.727 --> 00:42:23.354
Using Shion like that?

00:42:25.105 --> 00:42:27.524
Stay away from him! You hear me?

00:42:43.415 --> 00:42:44.291
‎Hey.

00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:45.626
What's wrong?

00:42:50.255 --> 00:42:51.965
Hello…

00:42:58.806 --> 00:42:59.932
Ichimatsu?

00:43:05.562 --> 00:43:06.563
Ai…

00:43:11.026 --> 00:43:12.069
Ai…

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.124
What? A virus?

00:43:25.207 --> 00:43:26.291
FOLLOW REQUEST

00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:27.459
What?

00:43:32.256 --> 00:43:33.966
HELLO, ICHIMATSU

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.721
YOU'RE IN 2025, RIGHT?

00:43:40.848 --> 00:43:42.433
DON'T BE SHOCKED WHEN YOU READ THIS

00:43:44.393 --> 00:43:45.602
DON'T FREAK OUT

00:43:47.604 --> 00:43:49.189
SERIOUSLY, DON'T FREAK OUT

00:43:49.273 --> 00:43:51.442
Just say it already!

00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:54.027
I'M IN 2055

00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:56.488
I'M ICHIMATSU

00:44:00.117 --> 00:44:02.161
YOUR FUTURE SELF

00:44:05.706 --> 00:44:08.542
SO CALL ME "I"

00:44:10.502 --> 00:44:11.628
I…?

00:44:14.882 --> 00:44:16.717
‎Don't come near us!

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.218
‎Get out, you murderer!

00:44:18.302 --> 00:44:19.970
‎Where is the present Fumito now?

00:44:20.053 --> 00:44:22.055
‎Where and what is he doing?

00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:23.307
‎Do you remember?

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.601
‎The last six months
‎of my memory will be gone.

00:44:26.226 --> 00:44:27.060
‎Goodbye.

00:44:27.144 --> 00:44:28.061
