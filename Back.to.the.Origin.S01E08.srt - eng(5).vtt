00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.920
When I was abroad,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.800
I used to hit luxury stores

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.560
and check...

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.200
Is she talking

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.440
to herself?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.680
There's a

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.320
ring light in front of her.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.720
She's livestreaming?

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.759
You watch every day and you don't know?

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.560
In real life,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800
people chasing luxury

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.000
don't actually

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.280
buy bags.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.320
Most people,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.680
other than resellers like me...

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.200
Can you see what she's streaming

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.479
on your phone?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.360
I left my phone in the bathroom.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.680
Buying this bag

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.440
is like buying a canvas tote.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.920
One of my clients

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.000
once told me

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.320
she never buys

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.800
super expensive bags

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.880
because she thinks no bag

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.920
is worthy of her.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.520
She said it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.560
so casually,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.160
but I thought

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.000
it was

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.160
really cool.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.440
Of course, luxury

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.360
means different things

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.520
to different people.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.480
Hold on, the background

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.960
doesn't look great.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.920
Let me find another spot.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.600
In my last video, I talked about

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.040
how important the brush is.

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.880
The hardness of the bristles

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.079
determines whether your bag

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.560
gets damaged.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.560
If you use a hard brush

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.120
on leather,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.400
you won't see scratches,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.880
but it's ruining

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.520
your bag.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.760
So what kind of brush

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.600
counts as the right tool?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.240
When...

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.320
Are you a spy or something?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.920
Which rival sent you?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.840
If you did,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.480
I'd kick you out right now.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.960
Go ahead.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.720
I've recorded this 18 times.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.440
It'd be the 19th take.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.480
My voice is hoarse.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.600
I nearly scrubbed a hole in the bag.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.880
Why not

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.960
do something you're good at?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.560
Something familiar?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.120
This is so tiring.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.160
Hosting is my strength,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.400
but nobody watches.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.600
What about

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:39.960
being a nun?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.200
What?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.160
Shave your head,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.079
hold a wooden fish,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.320
and strike it.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.240
I've seen those streams.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.400
Really boring.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.560
Like writing

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.560
or just sitting there.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.400
Tons of viewers.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.600
With gifts too, seriously.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.920
Yudong, how many times

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.040
have I told you not to sit on the bed

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.920
wearing outer clothes?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.200
Go wash your hands

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.960
and change, now.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.600
I'm exhausted.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.960
Hurry up. I'm tired too. Go now.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.160
How about I record it for you?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.880
What's this thing?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.640
It connects to my mic.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.800
Fancy.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.920
Go ahead.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.120
In last video

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.600
we talked about brush usage.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640
The hardness of the bristles...

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.560
Wait, wait, wait,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.160
I haven't started recording yet.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.959
One more time.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.960
Mom's outside.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.520
Fu Yudong.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.200
I can't sit with the outer clothes.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520
Can't sit on the bed.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.360
Give it to me.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.800
I'm recording all this

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.280
as evidence.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.960
Give it.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.120
- Hurry up.
- You hit me.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.920
Mom, Dad, don't wait for Ran.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.480
Here.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.960
I made you sweet fermented

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.000
rice with egg.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.600
I can't make

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.200
the candied egg here,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.720
so I poached it.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.320
Try it.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.960
Alright, alright. Go eat breakfast.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.320
Eat first and edit later.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.920
Okay.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.440
Has she eaten?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.600
She's editing.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.080
After breakfast, I'll

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.960
do the dishes.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.520
You two can go for your walk

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.640
or get groceries.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.240
No, I'll wash.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.960
Um, Ran and I won't

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.920
be home for lunch.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.320
We need to go out and shoot videos.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
Out again?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.120
Out...

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.280
Then what's the point of coming

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.160
back from Canada?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960
You're out all the time.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.760
She wasn't this busy

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.960
at the TV station.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.680
If she got

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.080
a proper job, fine.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.920
Now her schedule's a mess.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.680
She's just starting out. It's hard.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.520
Well...

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.000
A PhD is really different.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.760
You peeled the egg so easily.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.159
Look at that.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.560
Unlike me, it takes me forever.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.800
You? Forget it.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.080
Isn't that how everyone does it?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.720
No, I...

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.159
I peel bit by bit.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.320
Really?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.280
Yudong, so...

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.280
How's the job hunt going?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.040
You like helping people out,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.480
but don't spend all your time

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.080
fixing pipes and windows

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.760
for neighbors.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.080
Helping neighbors is fine,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.080
but it's not your field.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.360
You're wasting your talent,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.320
you know?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.080
I'm just saying what

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.680
your dad wants to say.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.840
He asked me to talk to you.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.480
It's okay, you...

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.880
Yeah.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.400
Thanks, Dad.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.960
Leave the egg there

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.880
and save it for Ran.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.040
Okay.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.240
Hey, Li, Li?

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.160
Have you seen it?

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.080
Seen what?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.200
Qiang, what's going on?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.960
No idea.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.400
They said everything was fine, right?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.640
Yeah, the notice just

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.320
came through.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.159
Did you ask?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.960
Did you?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.760
No.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.560
What? I'm getting water.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.600
Why is he acting like nothing happened?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.960
Let's get water together.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.880
Follow him, quick.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.040
I heard HR has

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.120
a layoff list

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.160
ready.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.480
Headquarters have sent

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.200
people over to do evaluations.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.080
Not a word in our department.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.280
Director Wang looks totally normal.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.520
Listen,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.360
this didn't come out of nowhere.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.200
We're usually

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.480
slammed this time of year.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.600
Now? Everyone's just sitting around.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.480
Come on, Li,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.520
no insider info

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.440
at all?

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.320
Yeah, give us a heads-up,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.520
so we can be prepared.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.760
If I knew something,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.120
why would I hide it from you?

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.679
Stop spreading rumors.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.799
Even if they're

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.520
laying off half the company,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.440
they wouldn't touch our team.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.160
We made the company

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.360
a fortune the past two years.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.160
How can they forget?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.480
Are they stupid?

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.560
The company has its own plan.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.000
No need to worry.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.280
Get back to work soon.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.680
I'm getting some water.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.200
Okay.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.560
Yudong said

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.360
it will just takes a moment,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.760
and before he leaves,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.920
he'll definitely clean our place

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.400
top to bottom,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.480
like they're

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.880
never here.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.680
Qi,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.360
isn't this helping them fake things?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.520
It's not faking.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.040
They're just shooting a video.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.960
Yudong told me Ran's

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.720
tried everything she can

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.120
to make these videos.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.200
Now she wants to

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.600
do some kind

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.600
of room tour,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.640
but they couldn't find

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.520
a suitable place.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520
So they

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.480
wanted to ask

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.600
if you could

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.840
lend them the place for a bit.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.400
Silence means

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.000
yes, right?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.880
Don't worry.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.120
I'll watch them the whole time.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.800
I won't let them make a mess.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.840
Watch them?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.000
Don't you have work?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.960
I took leave.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.320
Taking leave at a time like this?

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.600
What time like this?

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.480
Don't be dramatic.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.960
It's just gossip.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.640
Just the other day,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.600
someone from legal

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.680
told me our marketing campaign's

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.440
going great.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600
Don't worry.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.720
Nobody can shake

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.400
my position in the company.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.640
But I am

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.040
really lucky.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.360
I have such

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.640
an understanding wife like you.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.480
What did I do

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.560
to deserve you?

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.560
Why am I so...

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.120
Just help me now.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.560
I'll help, I'll help.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.160
But I honestly have

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.320
no clue how to do this puzzle.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.040
Every piece looks the same.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.440
Where do I even start?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.760
I've asked Daoqi to

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.680
lend us their place for a day.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.240
His place or Cheng Man's?

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.040
Same thing.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.160
How is it the same?

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.480
Last time I fought with her.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.920
Won't she hate me showing up?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.680
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.760
Nobody's going to bother you.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.000
Honey, carrying all this stuff,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.160
you kinda look like Nezha.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.600
Stop cleaning. I'll take care of it later.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.320
If Cheng Man's home

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.720
and sees the place all messy,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.280
what's she going to think of me?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.520
Does she know we're here today?

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.360
Yes.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.480
Hey, do you know

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.000
what your biggest strength is?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.000
My biggest strength

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.920
is having no strengths.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.280
Your best quality is being domestic.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.640
Hello everyone,

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.800
I'm Zhang Ran.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.360
In this video, I'll

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.080
show you the new house

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.120
I rented after

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.520
coming back.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.360
This place is

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.680
just temporary, though.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.400
I heard from my mom that

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.440
you went home the other day?

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.520
That's great.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.120
It's good to visit your parents often.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.240
Today I want to share

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.960
with you

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.360
kitchen items.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.720
The thing is,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.800
in a household,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.200
the kitchen...

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.760
Close!

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.240
Hello?

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.040
Hello everyone,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.160
I'm Zhang Ran.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.960
Today I'm sharing some

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.040
great kitchen products.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.840
I haven't been back long,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.760
so this house

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.480
I rented is

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.640
just temporary.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.160
Hope we can share ideas

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.840
and tips.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.720
Because a stove

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.840
means so much...

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.200
I didn't do anything.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.080
Smarty?

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.040
Smarty?

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.040
Retract.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.600
Smarty?

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.360
What's wrong?

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.040
Nothing.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.120
You got this.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.640
Hi everyone, I'm Zhang Ran.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.280
Today I'm recommending

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.400
some kitchen essentials.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.960
In kitchens...

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.200
What kind of smart home is this?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.640
Smarty?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.240
Smarty?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.560
Smarty?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.960
Smarty? Retract.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.160
Now let's look at this jar

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.000
of Lao Gan Ma.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.640
It's the most

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.320
beloved chili sauce

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.760
among

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.560
overseas Chinese.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.280
It can be used

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.240
as a hotpot base

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.520
and for making sauces.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.720
What chat group did you add me to?

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.880
Schoolmate.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.800
Don't feel awkward.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.240
Reconnect with them.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.400
They can always help.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.640
What happened?

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.560
I'm sorry,

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.320
I didn't mean to.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.960
Are you hurt?

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.360
I don't know how to use these

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.080
smart appliances.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.200
I was fumbling around

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.640
and...

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.680
Let me get you a band-aid.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.360
No, no really.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.440
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.840
Don't move. I'll handle it.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.280
I...

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.280
No, don't.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:10.720
Leave the shards there.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.680
I'll sweep them up later.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.920
Where did you get this?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.920
I'll buy you a new one.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.320
This smart-home stuff

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.040
is too complicated.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.960
I wasn't paying attention

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.000
and messed up.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.600
Smart home?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.280
Dumb home.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.080
I can't figure it out either.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.520
Let me put it on.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.400
Here, here, here.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.160
As long as your hand's okay.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.080
I'm fine, really.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.160
Okay.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.080
All good.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.520
I broke one the other day too.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.480
I should've put it away.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.680
No big deal.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.880
I'm really sorry.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.040
It's nothing.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.160
As long as you're okay.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.200
Be careful.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.560
Just leave the shards there.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.720
I'll clean them up later.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.480
- It's okay.
- It's fine.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.600
Yudong will take care of it.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.120
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.320
Just keep recording.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.640
It's done.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.680
I'll just stop here.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.200
It's fine. Keep going.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.080
It's finished anyway.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.560
I'm done recording.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.200
No, keep shooting.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.320
We'll continue our chat outside.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.680
I might be able

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.000
to fix this.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.360
I glued a cup like

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360
this before.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.360
Stop.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:58.920
Look what I've done.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.560
Don't touch them.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.360
That one's thicker.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.120
Put the pieces down.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.240
You can cut your hands too.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.000
Check this out.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Don't move. Don't, don't.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.920
Don't talk.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.320
Somehow this laptop

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.560
froze again.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.560
Doesn't this cup

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.880
look like the one

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.560
at Cheng Man's?

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.600
You don't need to whisper.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.560
The laptop can't hear you.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.600
Her cup cost 8,800 yuan.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.120
You can't replace that

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.640
with a 200-yuan one.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.080
8,800 yuan?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.440
That expensive?

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.080
I told you I didn't want to go,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.080
but you insisted.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.680
This isn't about the cup.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.080
It's about us losing face.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.600
My fault.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.160
I just wanted to help.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.600
You said you wanted to film a room tour,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.280
so I figured we'd go to their place

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.640
and shoot the video.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.640
Who knew...

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.800
I'm not blaming you.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.160
I'm just frustrated

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.760
my video isn't even edited yet.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.880
Not sure how much money

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.600
this video will make,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.000
but I need to spend 8,800 yuan.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.200
What a great loss.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.600
Don't worry about that.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.720
I forced you

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.400
to go film

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.960
at their place.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.480
I'll pay for the cup.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.720
With what?

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.840
You're hiding cash?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:19.640
All our money's

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.120
in our Canadian bank account.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.120
I can start working now.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.160
I can make money.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.560
I got a bunch of certifications.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.200
I can finally take jobs.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.640
Look, tomorrow I've got two gigs.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.200
Everyone

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.720
in this neighborhood is loaded.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.520
You've been taking exams these days?

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.160
I was free anyway.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.360
Alright, Dr. Fu is

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.720
starting to earn money.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.360
Is this the 8,800-yuan

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.840
cup?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.680
Forget about the cup.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.480
I'll find something with good quality

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.360
at a lower price.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.240
We appreciate your work here.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.319
Best wishes for the future.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.520
- Li.
- Li.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.680
I signed it just now.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.120
The compensation package is pretty good.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.680
Hit the jackpot.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.440
Li...

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.120
Save it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.320
You two, listen up.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.320
Without me here,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.760
nobody's got your back anymore.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.080
In the new team, don't be late

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.160
or leave early in first three months.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.840
Got it?

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.240
Yes.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.680
Behave yourselves.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.520
In those corporate dramas,

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520
don't people who resign

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.600
or get fired always leave

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.240
carrying a cardboard

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.480
box?

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.160
Li, wait, hold on.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.800
Li,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.600
I got this from the cleaner.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.680
Take it. It's new.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.360
Nice.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.800
Thanks.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.120
Superman's home!

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.960
You're back?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.200
Zhang Ran's quite thoughtful.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.720
She bought me a cup to replace

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720
the one she broke.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.000
She got it from the official store.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.480
Well,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.400
I didn't even have the nerve

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.440
to tell you about the cup.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.400
Now she gave you a new one,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.520
and you found out anyway.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.160
You really think I didn't know?

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:20.920
Right, right.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.680
Nothing gets past you.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.480
You drank?

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.240
Had a couple with Yudong.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.200
Celebrating.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.440
Your merger project

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.480
moved forward?

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.560
Completely dead.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.080
You're transferred to Director Wang's team?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.240
I got laid off.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.240
What?

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.160
Calm down.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.760
Sit, sit.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.640
Let me explain.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.920
Really, this is

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.440
a good thing.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.240
I thought it through.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.480
I'm

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.960
not suited for working

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.400
at these big foreign companies.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.400
Honestly,

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.800
at places like that, those

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.360
who get promoted

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.760
are a bunch of boot-lickers.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.960
I'm better suited for

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960
younger

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.320
start-ups

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.200
that value real ability

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.240
and performance.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.440
Somewhere I can

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.280
actually create value, right?

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.160
My college class monitor invited me

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.280
to his company last time.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.600
Maybe this is

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.280
a turning point in my life.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.440
I signed the agreement

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440
on spot.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.760
The compensation was N+1.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.800
It's a good deal.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.200
Yeah, totally.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.000
I think you're absolutely right.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.600
Not bad, right?

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.760
This is a good thing.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.760
And you know what?

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.640
The only reason I never quit

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.480
wasn't because

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.040
I couldn't get into a better company.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.080
I just valued loyalty.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.960
Now that they fired me,

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.960
when they realize

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.840
what they've lost, they'll regret it.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.160
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.120
Daoqi.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.040
Actually, there's no rush

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.600
to find a job.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.320
I'm not in a hurry.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.720
You've been working

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.840
for so long.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.920
Now you finally get to rest at home.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.760
That's a good thing.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.400
Yes.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.520
We should take our time.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.160
To be honest,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.240
it's fine

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.520
even if you don't work. No problem.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.960
Let me show you something.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.960
How so?

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.360
Look.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.440
This is the loan we need to pay off.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.840
The mortgage.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.600
I know.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.600
This is our cash account.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.960
We're loaded!

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.240
Listen,

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.720
once the mortgage

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.520
is paid off,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.880
we won't have

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.880
any major expenses.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.840
Yeah.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.240
For cash flow,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.480
we have insurance

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.680
and some fixed income

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.800
from investments.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.880
Plus the monthly commissions

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.120
from my insurance team.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.440
These passive incomes

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.880
are definitely enough to cover

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.480
our monthly expenses.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.960
-I see.
-So,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.600
don't feel pressured.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.480
No pressure at all.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.880
It's okay if you don't work.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.640
I have no pressure at all.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.040
Alright?

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.360
I'm completely stress-free now.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.040
It's okay. It's alright.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.320
I'm happy.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:44.920
Happy.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.200
We can just kick back and relax.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.640
Happy.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.400
It's fine. I'm here.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.120
Impressive.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.480
It's okay.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.360
It's fine.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.360
Great.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.920
Take your time.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.120
Fu Yudong,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.600
get the cake vouchers

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.360
Ms. Zhao gave us.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.640
They're in the left drawer.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.760
Why do you need those to see Qian Dan?

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.680
I'm giving them to the reception girl,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.800
cleaners, and security man.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.480
They're the hidden masters.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.000
The invisible network hub.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.560
The gossip relay station.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.920
I've already

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.160
won over the reception girl.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.360
Today I'll just reinforce it.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:26.760
Give them to me.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.160
Where did you learn all this?

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.360
This is what I've learned

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.560
from my time at the TV station.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.720
Why are you keeping two?

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.640
So stingy.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.480
Give them all to me.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.680
I'm off.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.560
If you don't use them all,

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.000
bring a couple back.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.320
I will if I don't need them.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.120
Okay.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.800
Bye.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.080
Take care.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.760
Liu.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.640
Hello.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.760
Where's Liu?

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.800
She quit.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.160
I just started two days ago.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.760
Did you need something from Liu?

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.920
I'm here to...

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.440
I... I work here.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.880
Ms. Qian scheduled a meeting with me.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.640
Could you please sign in?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.560
I haven't seen you before. Thank you.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.520
Let me confirm.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.800
Hello, Ms. Qian.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.840
There's a lady at the reception

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.080
[who says she has an appointment with you.]

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.280
Her name is...

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.360
Zhang Ran.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.520
Zhang Ran.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.000
Okay.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.920
[Ms. Qian's waiting for you in the room.]

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.600
Okay.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.320
I've been surfing lately,

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.840
and I've roughly got the hang

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.960
of how the platform traffic works.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.840
It works like this...

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.120
Right. The platforms

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.520
do have patterns.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.560
[So you should trust]

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.920
[us professionals.]

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.840
Here, take a look.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.600
This is our suggested account

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.720
for to use.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.520
[No content posted yet.]

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.920
[Look closely at the follower count.]

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.080
That's a lot.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.440
All active users.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.360
We haven't spent

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.400
a single cent.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.880
Now look at your

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.360
current account's follower count.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.120
How many?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.840
A hundred and twenty-seven.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.080
Not even enough for a fraction, right?

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.400
Our business team

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.200
put this account

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200
on some promotion platforms

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.880
to give it a try.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Some brands

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.480
are already reaching out.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.760
[Zhang Ran, I've always emphasized]

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.320
that why we have a contract

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.520
is because you have

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.160
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" persona.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.800
[You wanted to try other directions,]

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.880
[and we gave you time]

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.880
[and opportunity.]

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.760
So smart people

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.680
know when to stop.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.040
I... I just feel

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.040
this "desperate"...

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.920
I know.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.560
I understand.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.200
You care about your pride.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.360
Right?

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.880
[But do you want pride,]

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.120
or do you want fame? Your choice.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.880
Honey, you've been

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.000
pretty busy lately, right?

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520
You didn't expect to come back

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.080
and still do this kind of work,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.960
did you?

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.960
It's fine. Work is work, wherever it is.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.280
I visited Zhou today.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.040
[My mentor]

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.160
[from the TV station.]

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.280
He's already retired.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.520
It's been ten years

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.520
since I left the station.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.080
When looking back

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.640
on how hard I fought

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.240
for screen time ten years ago,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.120
it feels like yesterday.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.720
Back then,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.160
I pushed forward shamelessly

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.760
to get any chance to be on camera.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.360
Now, with the chance to be on camera,

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.120
I still have to be shameless.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.560
Not at all.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.280
That's not shameless.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:20.880
Inside.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.960
I've lost my self-respect inside.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.240
If you don't want to do it,

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.880
then don't.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.160
No need to force yourself.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.280
We're already back.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.600
I have to stick with it.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.760
How can I quit like that?

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.800
You always say the same things.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.960
How... How can I just quit like that?

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.520
You're so reckless.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.640
It's not about being shameless.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.080
It's not.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.600
If you don't want to fix pipes,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.520
then don't.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.520
Honey, do you think I can do this?

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.800
Yes.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.960
Absolutely.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.160
Hello, Mr. Neng Service.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.720
Hello.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.520
Ethan?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Is that you, Ethan?

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:57.920
Well...

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.600
Ran, where are you?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.720
I... I'm out.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.320
Why didn't you tell me

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.840
you were back?

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.080
I'm mad at you.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.120
Look how coincidental this is.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.320
See who's here with me.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.120
Can you see?

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.960
Can you see clearly?

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.080
[Let me zoom in.]

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.360
Come over for dinner tonight.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.400
It's all ready.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.920
[I'll send you the address.]

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.080
[Get here soon.]

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.800
Ethan, there's a problem, right?

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.600
A small one.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.960
[Let me get you some water.]

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.920
No, thanks.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.240
[Here, have some water.]

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.560
Thanks.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.880
Oh, I didn't

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.640
[even offer you slippers. Sorry.]

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.480
[Don't bother.]

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.640
No, I insist.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.760
If I'd known it was her home,

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.200
I wouldn't have taken this job.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.240
I'm sorry.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.800
You're not stealing or robbing anyone.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.840
Nothing to be sorry for.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.560
Not your fault. Don't worry about it.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.480
[Ran, I'm really mad at you.]

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.240
[You don't even see me as a friend.]

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.600
You didn't even tell me you were back.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.560
I thought you'd be busy.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.400
This place is huge, Yuan Yuan.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720
It's alright.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.280
Yudong, you're not drinking?

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.400
[You always just watch us drink.]

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.320
That's from Zhou's retirement party

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.920
the station held for him.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.920
Ran, I've decided.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.200
I'll take over his position.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.200
A civil service job is secure. Right?

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.320
Better than struggling out there on my own.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.040
That's great. It suits you.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.560
I have to thank you.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.000
You gave me the opportunity.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.520
Here's to you.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.600
Is this your first time at my place?

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.640
Yes.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.120
Can't compare

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.280
to your big house abroad.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.080
No point comparing them.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.400
As long as you're comfy living in it.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:32.800
Right.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.640
The Forbidden City is huge,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.840
but the emperor only lived in one room.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.560
Yes, the place is quite livable.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.880
But the decor

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.640
just feels a bit outdated sometimes.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.960
Yudong, if I'd known

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.640
[you were good at this,]

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.800
I'd have asked you.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.680
Did you learn this abroad

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.080
or after you came back?

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.320
Actually, I...

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.560
Our house in Canada

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.360
was quite big,

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.920
so sometimes,

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.080
when something went wrong,

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.600
[he'd fix them.]

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.040
Over time, he got the hang of it.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.480
Right. The principles

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.200
are mostly the same.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.080
See,

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.280
smart people really are different.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.440
They learn everything fast.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.000
[Right.]

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.200
So, do you have any plans

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.480
now that you're back?

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.840
Zhang Ran has a clear idea

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.680
of her career.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.560
But I

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.440
haven't quite figured mine out yet.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.760
So it's a temporary thing for now.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.800
See, I knew it.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.840
You have a PhD, after all.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.600
You couldn't have come back

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.800
just to do this.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.400
Can I say something?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.800
Background checks

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.200
are very strict here now.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.720
Even for a temporary job,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.840
I think you should weigh your options.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.280
Choose something more suitable.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.160
Like what?

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.720
Ran, your pride is getting in the way.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.480
If you'd told me

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.440
about Yudong's situation earlier,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.840
I could've helped.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:54.960
[I could've found him]

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.120
[a more valuable job.]

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.520
What he's doing now

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.080
just isn't really appropriate.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.200
What's wrong with what he's doing now?

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.720
I didn't mean anything by it.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.480
I just think...

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.840
[Yuan Yuan, what kind of work]

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.160
do you consider valuable?

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.680
I just think

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.000
it's a waste of Yudong's talent.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.640
This afternoon,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.840
Fu Yudong

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.000
worked his butt off to fix

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.320
the problem in your home, right?

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:20.720
That kind of work

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.960
should count as valuable, right?

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.560
What valuable work

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.600
does your husband do?

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.960
Is he out hustling again?

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.280
He's not home? Where did he go?

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.240
What's it to do with you?

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.040
Nothing to do with me.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.960
I was just asking.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.320
I heard...

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320
He's busy.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.440
He has no time to fool around.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.160
You must be so lonely

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.800
in this big house all by yourself.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.720
I heard

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.160
your relationship isn't great.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.880
Are you getting a divorce?

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.800
Who told you that?

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.320
I forgot. But it doesn't matter.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.680
If you are getting divorced,

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.880
you should definitely consult me.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.040
I've been through it. I'm experienced.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.960
I can tell you all about it.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.720
Right. You do have experience.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.600
[We won't]

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.640
[stay for dinner.]

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.880
Thanks for having us.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.040
Well, Yuan Yuan,

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.000
if you're so kind-hearted,

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.520
give Yudong

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.400
a five-star review. Thanks.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.440
A five-star review.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.360
Okay. Good.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.240
I'm sorry

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.560
you had to go through that today.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.880
It's nothing. I'm fine.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.960
Today I vented all my anger

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.280
since I got back.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.240
Fu Yudong, let me say it again,

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.360
you did nothing wrong.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.280
Your job is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.040
Neither of us

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.240
did anything wrong.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.520
You're not being sarcastic, are you?

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.080
Dear former colleagues,

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.000
hello.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160
This is Zhang Ran.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.920
[I've returned to start my own business.]

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.000
I've created an account.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.840
Hope you all can support me by sharing,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.160
commenting, and liking! Thank you!

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.240
Honey, you're amazing.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.560
Your old self is back.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.280
For a second,

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.520
it was like you were Sun Wukong,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.400
landing from the sky

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.800
with your golden staff

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800
and sitting right here.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.720
This is the golden staff.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.160
And you're sitting right here.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.040
Yes.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:18.920
Really?

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.560
Yes.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.000
So cool.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.080
I'm a bit hungry.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.320
Perfect. I earned

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320
some money today.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.600
I'll treat you to skewers.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.320
It's Yuan Yuan's money.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.200
Spending her money makes it even better.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.000
Let's go!

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.000
I want to earn her money too.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.240
I'll go clean her house.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.440
You won't earn much.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.240
It adds up over time.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.480
No need.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.600
Come on.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.760
What are you doing?

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.640
A fairy doesn't walk.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.680
Hey, Yuan Yuan.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.640
Come have some skewers.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.000
Hello, everyone.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.480
I'm Zhang Ran, the person behind

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.520
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" meme.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.320
I don't know

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.600
if you recognized me.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.440
I hope you'll all support me.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.680
Please give me a like

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.440
and follow my account.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.600
I kind of regret it now.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.120
If... If I'd known

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.920
I was going to be filmed that day,

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.040
I would've worn

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.440
something brighter.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.480
Back when I was a host,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.440
I took

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.640
on-camera appearances very seriously.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.160
I never just grabbed any clothes

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.080
for a show.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.160
I'm Zhang Ran.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.840
Hello, everyone! I'm Zhang Ran.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.520
Hello.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.680
Hello, I'm Zhang Ran.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.920
I'm your host, Zhang Ran.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.360
The thing is,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.320
I'm pretty ordinary,

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.640
so I'm afraid people

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.400
might not remember me.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.080
Do you know

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.280
why we have a contract?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.480
Maybe it's because of

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.480
my work skills

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.440
or my on-camera experience?

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.240
I... I also had

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.800
a meme that went viral...

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.240
[You've finally hit the nail on the head.]

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.000
It's exactly

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.720
because of that meme.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.520
And only because of that meme.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.560
It's been years since I faced a camera.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.840
Now that I'm meeting everyone again,

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.640
I really hope you'll remember me.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.640
So today, I specifically wore

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.200
the same clothes I had on

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.600
when that meme was filmed.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.120
So I

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.960
am Zhang Ran, the person behind

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.960
the "Desperate Personal Shopper" meme.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:34.880
Thank you, everyone.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.200
Having dreams?

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:30.920
Zhang Ran.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.000
Zhang Ran,

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.600
your phone has been vibrating non-stop.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.400
Here.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.680
Let me get you some water.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:04.960
[Like a rocket!]

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.000
[Come on, let's celebrate!]

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.800
One hundred thousand!

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.320
I'm replying to their comments.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.600
So that's the soda depot

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.080
you loved as a kid, right?

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.000
Yes.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.440
You remembered what I said.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.200
This was the logistics department

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.720
of our sugar factory.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.960
In summer when they handed out cola,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.080
we'd line up here.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.440
It may look run-down now.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.720
But back then, it was

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.320
the CBD of our sugar factory.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.520
The core crowded area

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.600
was right here. Right here.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.680
I'm always happy when I come back here.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.200
I thought celebrating

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:39.840
for my 100k followers here

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.800
would be meaningful.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.520
[Absolutely.]

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.520
More meaningful than a candlelit dinner.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.000
Exactly.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.760
Another toast.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.480
Cheers.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.480
When I was a kid, after getting my cola,

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.000
I'd take two to school.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.960
One for me,

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.760
and one for the kid I liked.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.840
Which kid did you like?

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.600
A boy or a girl?

00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.560
A really

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.840
cute little boy.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.600
No. Just kidding.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.320
For the dog.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.520
Male or female?

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.840
So annoying. Take that!

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.440
Back when I couldn't

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.320
get my videos right,

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.280
you told me it was fine,

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.000
and if it didn't work out,

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.520
we can just go back.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.880
At first, it sounded pretty pessimistic.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.080
But it actually

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.240
made me feel really secure.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.320
I feel like

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.160
with you always supporting me,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.480
encouraging me,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.680
and having my back,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.840
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.240
So I just charge ahead.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.160
And look,

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.240
I actually made it work.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.640
Who would've thought?

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.000
You're the one who's amazing.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.280
Anyway,

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280
I'll keep working hard.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400
I'm determined to

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.760
make something of myself on this path.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.160
I hope you'll

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.280
keep supporting me, honey.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.680
Absolutely.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.520
This place really is

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.320
your lucky spot.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.920
I can almost feel

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.120
how glorious it used to be.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.840
Right?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.920
Look at those characters on the wall.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.520
Struggling gets you fire.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.560
Yes, but why the fire?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
No. It's

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.400
struggling gets you on fire.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.880
Where is the preposition?

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.880
You should get some paint

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.760
and fix it tomorrow.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.720
Here. Everything I want to say

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.560
boils down to one sentence.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.840
May you get on fire!

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.640
Can you do it?

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.040
What's this? A fake burp.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.960
This is what we did

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.760
when we drank cola as kids.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.560
I can't do it.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.160
Try.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.720
I can't.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.840
Listen, the whole point

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.280
of drinking cola is to burp.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.000
I can't make myself burp.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.520
Really. Just try. Come on.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.760
I always drink it but I can't do it.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.320
You stop

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.120
whenever I stop.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.840
Feel great?

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.600
Where's the force coming from?

00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.560
Take a few more big gulps.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560
Tell me, where do I push from?

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.480
Honey, your tonsils

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.680
are a bit big.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.680
We need to go to the hospital tomorrow.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.640
Does your cola still have fizz?

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.560
Let's try another one.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.760
-Honey, you...
-Come on.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.520
I really wish

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.440
you could do it like me.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.400
Your lymph nodes are a bit...

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.600
Come on, try.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.480
Always forgetting things when going out.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.760
So scatterbrained.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.320
By the bed. Where?

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.280
I don't know.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.440
[Just search around that area.]

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.240
[Check around the dressing table.]

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.800
Not in the nightstand.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.120
[Around the dressing table.]

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.720
The dressing table.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.880
[Hurry up, honey.]

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.240
[The bank's about to close!]

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.280
Okay. I know!

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.080
[Found it? Need me to help?]

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.040
No. Found it!
