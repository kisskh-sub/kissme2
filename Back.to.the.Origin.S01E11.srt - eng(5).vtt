[Oops!]

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.960
Mr. Zhou?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.520
They're getting out.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.320
Good day, Mr. Zhou.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.120
For that job Zhan Ran got Liu Bo

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.560
at the big company,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
I haven't thanked you properly.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.880
The shrimp's fresh.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.680
Let me get you some.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.560
No, no.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.360
Free of charge.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.920
It's not the money.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.039
We're just grabbing

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.080
a quick bite for lunch.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.160
Zhang Ran's treating us

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.440
to a big dinner tonight.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.040
So no cooking today.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.040
Alright. Whenever you want it,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.920
just let me know.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.840
You're too kind, really.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.120
I'll deliver it to your place.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.000
[Thanks.]

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.240
Come on in.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.920
We're heading in.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.360
Alright.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.120
I've asked for permission.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.079
Take no notes.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.160
Ask me anything if you need.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.840
Okay.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.000
That look on your face

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.640
is exactly

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.200
like mine

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.160
on my first day here.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.920
Really?

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.360
Ran,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.840
about the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.800
topic planning,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.079
editing and filming...

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:41.920
All that stuff.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.600
I've never done any of it.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.040
It's fine.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.760
If I ever...

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.560
It's totally okay.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.480
Not everyone knows.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.440
You'll pick it up too.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520
The biggest problem

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.600
with my account is that...

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.440
Morning, Ran.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.160
Morning.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.200
... That it gets a lot of hate comments.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.520
Pretty nasty comments.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.720
So, as my assistant,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.600
your main task is to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.280
reply to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.240
what you can

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.440
and delete the rest

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.000
every 20 minutes or so. Got it?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440
Okay... no. Come here.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.480
Let me break it down for you.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.320
Okay.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.760
Gotta be big companies.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.360
["Little White Sail"'s algorithm]

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.400
seemed updated again.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.200
Have you heard?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.680
Now you gotta post clips,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.280
or they won't push the stream.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.720
[Thanks.]

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.400
[Changing every day. So annoying.]

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.320
I mean, lately,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.880
the platform rules have been

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.800
changing like crazy.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.800
I wonder if you can show me the ropes?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.840
I can do anything.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.560
Model, streamer assistant, you name it.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.160
I'm not picky.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.800
You're a fitness live streamer, right?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.600
That I am.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.680
We'll see.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.880
Thanks. Appreciate it.

Yeah.

Hey everyone.

[Yes.]

Hi, I'm Zhuang Meng.

I'm a fashion streamer.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.480
Hi, Meng.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.200
Nice to meet you.

Her crew's getting bigger.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.120
Hi, Qiuqiu.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.360
Hi there.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.800
It's my first day.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.640
Hope I can learn more from you,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.440

We all help each other out around here.

Ran

looks out for us too.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.160
Sure.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.440
Now that I'm her assistant,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.920
we're all one big family.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.920
We can help each other out.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.080
Family, exactly.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.640
Bo, just call me Le.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.640
Hi, Mr. Le.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.800
No "Mr." necessary.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.120
I'm a fitness blogger.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.079
We can hit the gym

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.839
if you are interested.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.880
Sure thing!

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.680
Bo, I heard

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.640
Ran has a sportswear live special

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.040
next month?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.840
Could you hook me up?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.600
No idea about the live stream,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.160
but there is a short video shoot.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.520
You handle the short videos?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.640
Yep.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.240
So you and Xiaohe, the other assistant of Ran's,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.600
split the work,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.000
right?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.640
Xiaohe?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.120
Never heard of her.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.360
I'm Ran's only assistant.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.320
Only assistant?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.240
Liu Bo,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.600
are you Ran's... as in Lin Anran's assistant?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.720
No, I'm Zhang Ran's assistant.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.720
Ran as in Zhang Ran.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.440
Zhang Ran's assistant, huh?

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.880
Right.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.760
Nice to meet you.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.640
Alright, you guys chat.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.280
Okay.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.920
Who's Zhang Ran?

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.880
The "Desperate Personal Shopper" meme girl.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.000
Listen, kid.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.920
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.320
Around here,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.480
the only "Ran" we call here

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.920
is Lin Anran, the top streamer.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.280
Right. Got it.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.240
Look at these.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.720
All from big supermarkets.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.200
Big brands.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640
Not like the shady stuff

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.520
from the stalls.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.440
They're 100% safe.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.040
Nian.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.880
[Grandma saw the ads on TV]

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.720
for these.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.880
All the kids love them,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.840
so I got them for you.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.560
Do you like it?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.320
Thanks, Mom. You're so generous.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.720
Buying things for you

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.040
is never a waste.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.040
Come on, dig in!

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.520
Nian, say thank you to Grandma.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.840
I'm sure Nian loves it.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.360
Thank you.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.040
But,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.400
we just had dinner.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.640
So we won't have any now.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.840
Let's put it away for later.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.400
Right, right, you've eaten.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.360
Yes, you've eaten.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.320
Not now.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.600
Okay.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.760
Alright, that's fine.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.640
Thanks, Mom.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.920
Don't mention it.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.240
Good boy.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.760
I'll...

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.520
[Oh, Nian,]

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.800
[didn't you draw]

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.760
[a picture of Grandma?]

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.560
[It's really good.]

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.520
Let's go show it to her.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.040
Okay?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.800
Really?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.200
Yeah.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.520
Grandma will love it.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.560
Such a nice, smart boy.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.120
What are you doing?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.720
What are you standing around for?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.800
I'm half dead.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.760
You what?

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.880
I'm the one that's half dead.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.720
Didn't you saw?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.880
She won't let him have it.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.640
I was...barking up

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.680
the wrong tree.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.560
Pointless.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.160
Cost me a pretty penny too.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.320
Don't you worry.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.240
I'll find a way

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.400
to make sure

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.680
your grandson eats all of this.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.840
Really? It's a deal.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.680
Deal.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.960
Don't worry.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.840
Why that forced smile?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.400
It's genuine.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.120
What?

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.400
Did she scold you

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.440
for being unemployed?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.360
No.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.520
Cheng Man told me

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.000
to stay home

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.360
and rest up for a while.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.280
Really?

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.680
Yeah.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.280
She said don't rush to find a job.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.840
Look how good I look these days.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.480
I feel like I've made up for

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.840
all the sleep I missed in years.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.280
Your face is indeed glowing.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.800
I gotta say,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.800
Cheng Man's pretty great about that.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.120
Not just that.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.720
She's great all around.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.800
You won't find a better daughter-in-law.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.680
Stop watching those TV dramas

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.160
with evil mothers-in-law

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.560
and picking up their habits.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.960
Alright,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.480
cut it out.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.600
Give me a break.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.080
To me, you brat, are a classic

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.160
case of "out of sight,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.520
out of mind" after marriage.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.480
You might forget your mom,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.240
but she hasn't forgotten you.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.120
What are you doing?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.280
What do you mean?

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.160
See for yourself.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.520
Don't use your hands!

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.920
It's fine.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.640
Oh, no.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.400
Such a rush!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600
Use chopsticks!

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.400
No need.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.440
It's hot.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.280
Oh my, it's true.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.000
Good?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.840
Nian, come show Grandma.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.000
Stop eating.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.400
Well-done, my boy!

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.000
[You gave me such big eyes!]

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.720
Was it good, huh?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.880
[What did you eat?]

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.680
Good job.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680
The cat whiskers are

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.520
typical of your grandma.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.560
There's another one?

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.280
[Grandma's got huge eyes.]

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.800
[Smart boy.]

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.960
[This one made Grandma]

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.400
[look way too ugly.]

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.000
[The crab is their specialty.]

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.320
I'd say passable.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.520
[Yudong,]

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.200
what are you implying?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.360
[I mean, they make]

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.120
[good crabs here.]

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.039
But, honestly,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.080
it's not as good as

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080
Mom's home cooking.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.520
Smooth talker.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.640
I can't compare to them.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.440
I actually

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.600
learned from them.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.800
[I should peel the ginger]

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.360
[the same way they do.]

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.400
You pay attention to the details.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.720
[But eat less ginger at night.]

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.960
"Ginger at night, harm no slight."

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.560
[Last time we ate with Yudong,]

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.600
[I didn't notice]

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.000
[he was such a sweet talker.]

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.520
He's sure not.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.800
He's telling the truth.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.720
Every single word of it.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.480
[Look at you,]

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.240
already

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.200
picking his side.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.120
You're already charmed

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.520
by his smooth talk.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.040
You haven't been back long.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.640
How'd you know

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.920
this place was good?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.040
On your mom's recommendation?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.040
Uncle said

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.920
it's the best

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.960
local spot.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.440
[You really]

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.560
[asked the right guy.]

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.520
Your uncle

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.520
is always at business dinners,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.880
wining and dining clients.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.160
He's eaten his way through the whole city.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.160
[He's a gourmet.]

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.480
[Not bad, uncle.]

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.760
Not really.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.960
Don't see you gaining weight, though.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.440
I'll join you.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.680
Look how happy Dad is.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200
The prices here

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.920
are no mediocre.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.640
Last time here it was my birthday.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.920
[Ailing's treat.]

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.360
I'd never come on my own dime.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.320
And this time

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.720
I was mooching off

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.880
[my daughter and son-in-law.]

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.440
Mom, less talking,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.040
more eating.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.720
No mediocre dishes.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.760
Let's raise our glasses.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.480
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.480
Sorry for the trouble.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.360
Mwah!

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.640
Come on.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.720
Now that you're back,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.680
your mom and I

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.400
get to

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.880
see you every day,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.760
[which is a relief.]

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.880
[Our mind's at ease.]

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.360
[Whereas your aunt and uncle...]

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.760
Drink up!

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.400
Cheers!

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.480
[Think how many bouts you've had]

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.280
since I'm back.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.960
All credit goes to my daughter.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.680
Exactly.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.880
Xinying's company

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.640
[is with all sorts of...]

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.400
[No choice.]

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.240
[People want freedom.]

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.800
[They take holidays all the time.]

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.480
[Always off vacationing somewhere.]

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.560
See?

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.920
[Liu Bo]

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.720
[landed another job.]

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.000
Tripping far and wide.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720
Nice spot, right?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.880
I mean,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.480
Xinying is a real looker.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.040
What now?

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.640
Why are you giving me that look?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.200
[Oh, Mom...]

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.200
[What she means is,]

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.360
[you got your looks from me.]

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.560
[She was involved, wasn't she?]

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.040
I thought Toronto was freezing.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.200
Why's she dressed so light?

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.240
See?

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.520
[Is this a new post?]

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.240
Just the other day.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.280
Let me see.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.040
Right?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.960
Maybe she's posting old pictures

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.480
as if they were recent?

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.720
[You can't be too careful.]

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.760
[It shouldn't be.]

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.920
What if she's

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.920
hiding the

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.880
bad news

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.840

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.600
Keep an eye out.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.120
[Probably off on another trip,]

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.400
and didn't bother to tell me.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.360
I'll text her.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.040
Seriously? Now?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.400
What time is it there?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.520
She must be asleep.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.320
[She's on vacation, remember?]

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.600
Thing is,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.880
kids that age

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.680
are too energetic, so they dress light.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.840
Folks over in Canada

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.640
don't mind the cold.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.080
T-shirts in winter, for real.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.760
Tough as nails.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.680
Ran would know. I trust her.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.720
We've never been there.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.480
Maybe kids there grow up in

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.680
shorts and tees.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.720
Hardy bunch.

[Alright,]

[You'll finish it if I look away.]

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.760
Can't book online.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.000
Then that's a no on my side.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.120
We're simply fully booked.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.520
But last time,

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.080
when the app showed no rooms,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.120
the receptionist

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.000
found one for me.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.800
It's peak season now.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.880
Your long-term stay rate

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.880
ended a while ago.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.280
Can you just

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.600
check your system

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.560
one more time?

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.160
You know,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.600
I've been staying here quite long.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.200
I'm basically

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.360
a regular, right?

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.440
There's nothing I can do.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.000
The price is firm.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.280
Sorry for that.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.800
[You scared me!]

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.360
What's all this?

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.840
You brought your suitcase?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.160
I have no place to stay now.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.360
Let me crash at yours.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.760
I've been waiting since four.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.040
Where have you been?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.320
Are you dense?

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.840
Why didn't you call?

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.440
My phone died.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.480
I can't believe it.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.880
You're in the 21st

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.320
century,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.040
couldn't you borrow a charger?

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.920
It'd been dead already.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.320
How was I supposed to do that?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.080
Let's go.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.200
Hold on.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.600
What, you need a hand?

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.240
My legs went numb.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.320
Can't get up.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.000
Here, have some water.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.520
I don't like it warm.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.400
Got anything cold?

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.120
Oh right, I forgot.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.400
You Canadians only drink ice water.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.080
Nothing hot.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.880
Don't tease me.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.040
I just need to chill. Literally.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.840
Well then,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.960
do Chinese apples pass inspection?

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.560
Spill it.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.760
What's wrong?

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.880
Job hunt's a bust.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.240
Zero leads.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.440
I can't even afford the hotel anymore.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.920
They said it's peak season,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.120
no more discounts.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.440
So you're my last resort.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.480
Manfei,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.280
don't worry,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.920
once I land a job,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.760
I'll get my own place.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.280
But until then,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.680
while I'm here,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.840
I'll do all the chores.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.320
You know my mom's here.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.480
If you stay tonight,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.080
you'll have to

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.160
share the bed with me.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.160
If you let me stay,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
I'll even offer...my body.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.800
Ew,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.960
that's gross.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.960
If you keep that up,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.320
my Xiaofu will get

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.560
jealous.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.160
Li Manfei!

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.560
[What?]

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.080
Putting your man before your friend?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.120
While I was waiting,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.040
I realized

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.680
ending up like this

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.000
is the fault of the liar.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.840
Which "liar"?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.800
Who else?

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.960
"Ge"... what's his name again?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.360
Don't ever start!

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:56.960
Listen,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960
when I find him,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.320
I'm gonna make him

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.640
pay up.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.600
Every last penny.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.320
Yeah, get it all even.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.920
After you sleep it off,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.840
we'll go track him down.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.240
Let me go grab

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.520
your toiletries.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.800
You can use

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.320
my mom's slippers

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.160
temporarily.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.600
We'll buy you new ones tomorrow.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:19.960
Oh...

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.400
Your mom's slippers...

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.920
are pretty retro.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.000
Then what will she wear?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.840
It's fine. She has more pairs.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:31.720
Well...

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.880
It's so late.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.920
Why hasn't your mom come back yet?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.440
She's been in her room the whole time.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.520
She even cut those apples herself.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.880
[Xinying,]

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.440
[I welcome you with both hands]

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.520
[to stay at our home.]

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.560
[Make yourself at home,]

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.920
[don't be shy at all.]

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.440
[That scammer]

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.960
[definitely deserves to be dealt with.]

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.240
[Well done.]

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.520
Thank you, Auntie.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.680
[Alright, you two rest early.]

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.839
I can play the piano.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.680
Your resume looks pretty good.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.319
Our HR

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.120
will contact you later.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.760
That's it?

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.520
Yes, that's all.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.760
Hello, next.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.280
Thank you.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.800
Yorkson University, Canada?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.920
What kind of school is that?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.320
Never heard of it.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.400
The only foreign universities

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.720
I know are

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.720
like Harvard and Yale.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.640
These days, returnees aren't worth much anymore.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.240
It's long past the era

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.280
where just having a foreign degree

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.680
automatically made you golden.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.400
You're right.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.560
Like that cousin

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.240
I told you about,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240
my aunt's son,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.000
according to my mom,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.080
my aunt is sending

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.760
him abroad

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.200
just to avoid the Gaokao.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.800
They must be loaded.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.320
Come back and take Civil Servant Exam?

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.320
Who knows?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.040
Maybe he

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.080
will even send a resume

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.800
to a small-time company like ours.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.640
The only thing that's sad

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.000
is those few hundred thousand in tuition fees.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.560
Do we really have to stay here

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.480
until six o'clock?

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.880
The company isn't even hiring.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.680
Why make us sit here

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.880
collecting resume?

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.120
The boss is just ticking a box for the district.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.040
Putting on a show.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.240
Still, I think it's kind of nice.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.280
What are you doing?

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.040
Me?

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.440
I paid to have my resume color-printed

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.720
and you're wasting my money.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.120
What kind of person is she?

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.080
She scared the hell out of me just now.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.400
Forget her. Wanna grab some milk tea?

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.680
Bro, how much did you pay

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.880
for that?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.920
Just ten yuan.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.240
How is it so cheap?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.880
Yeah, ten yuan.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.560
At that place,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.800
they have ten-yuan and fifteen-yuan ones.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.120
The fifteen-yuan comes with extra chicken wings.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.720
Over at Shannan Plaza

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.200
there's chicken rice.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.280
Delivery guys and cleaners

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.840
all get 20% off.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.160
That cheap?

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.800
Yep. You're new to the job, right?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:14.840
Yeah.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.000
Actually,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.000
I originally started as a designated driver.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.680
It's just that

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.880
there aren't many rides during the day,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.200
so I deliver food on the side

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.360
to earn a bit more.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.760
You're working two jobs, man?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.560
Yeah.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.120
Does designated driving pay well?

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.520
It's decent.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.400
Bro,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.880
if you can drive,

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880
you could do designated driving too.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.280
It won't interfere with your daytime deliveries.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.480
Really?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.680
Hey man,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.760
would it be okay

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.120
if I added

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.040
you on WeChat?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.640
Let me scan your code.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.040
Here.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.400
We have a group for picking up rides.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.240
Whenever there's a hotspot,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.120
the guys in the group

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.320
will tip each other off.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.040
Awesome, thanks so much, bro.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.040
Alright.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.920
Bro,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.560
take this drink.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.320
So polite.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:58.920
All good!

00:19:59.280 --> 00:19:59.800
My pleasure!

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.720
Thank you.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.160
Alright, alright.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.480
No. 23...

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.760
Here it is.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.680
This one too?

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.080
Yep.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.840
Coming.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.680
I'm downstairs.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.600
I'm downstairs.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.280
No joke.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.080
Your complex is huge.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.080
I went to the wrong building earlier.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.360
[It's past the time limit. I don't want it anymore.]

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.360
[I've already left you a bad review.]

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.080
[So deal with it.]

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.560
How about I bring it up to you?

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.760
Or...

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.360
I'll pay for it myself.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.480
Could you change it to a good review?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.920
Here's your order.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.840
I didn't order it.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.760
[Put it wherever you want.]

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.520
[I'm not taking it anyway.]

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.120
Fine.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.560
[Hello, Miss Lu.]

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.440
[Regarding the fake job posting]

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.640
[you just reported,]

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.280
[our team]

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.600
[will verify and handle it promptly.]

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.080
[Please wait patiently.]

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.680
[We'll contact you]

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.280
[as soon as there's any update.]

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.240
Scumbag.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.760
You vanished

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.960
without a word.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.480
I'm sorry...

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.760
Scumbag.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.720
Total scumbag.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.120
Stray Dog Walking at Night.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.320
Need a ticket, buddy?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.880
Show's starting soon.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.680
I'll sell it to you cheap.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.320
No thanks.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.440
Since when do designated drivers watch plays?

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.160
Wanna see the play?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.120
I've got cheap tickets.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.000
Special price for you.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.160
Sold another case.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.120
Put it right here.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:06.840
Got it.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.360
Another case sold.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.600
Coming.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.000
Bro.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.680
Hello.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.240
Here...

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.360
Just put it here.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.200
Alright, alright.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.880
Got it, got it.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.480
I need some water.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.000
Sure.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.280
Find somewhere to sit.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:17.760
Okay.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.040
Can I leave some cards here?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:19.600
Go ahead.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.320
Designated driver cards.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:39.800
Excuse me.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.720
Designated driver cards.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:14.560
Mr. Zhong.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.720
Xinying. You're here.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.360
I'm exhausted today.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.680
The usual, extra meat, please.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.200
No problem.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.560
Sit wherever.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.880
Coming right up.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.080
Long time no see.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.200
I thought you were dead.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.240
Almost.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720
Why are you back?

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.360
Guess.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520
Pretending to be a designated driver again?

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.120
Who are you fooling?

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.920
I was in the middle of rehearsal

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240
and stepped out for a bite.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.760
Still not done rehearsing.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:58.840
Wanna eat?

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.120
Hey, don't run.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.520
Ge Kaiyang, you liar.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.640
Come back and explain yourself.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.160
Ge Kaiyang.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.640
I'll treat you to the play next time.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.600
Bro.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.640
Yang.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.680
You're finally here.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.680
Look at this car.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.160
How am I supposed to drive it?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.600
I don't even dare touch it.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.000
It's a 500-yuan ride.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.600
I wouldn't earn that even if I wanted to.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.400
But, but...

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.880
my scooter... it won't fit.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800
I've already taken

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.680
photos of the car,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.880
and I put

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.920
the mats on.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.600
So here's the thing...

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.800
How about this:

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.920
I'll leave it here for now,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.520
you send me the location later,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.120
and I'll split 200 yuan of the fee with you, okay?

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.320
That's too much.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.520
Thanks, Yang.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.200
You're welcome.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.880
Leave it with me.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.200
Alright, alright.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:12.720
Alright.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.640
Okay.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.960
Helmet.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.800
It's fine, I'll carry it.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.160
You hold it then.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:16.520
Got it.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.000
Okay, okay.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.440
Good.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.320
You've uploaded all the photos, right?

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.200
It's all yours now.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.880
Alright, alright.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.600
Hello.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.680
Lidai Designated Driver at your service.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.320
Sorry about that.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.040
He puked all over you.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.520
It's fine, it's fine.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.360
Thanks so much for the help,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.040
otherwise I couldn't have

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.720
carried him alone.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.160
No problem.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.160
Just give me a five-star review.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.880
Will do.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.960
I'll tip you in a sec.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.720
Thank you, thank you.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.760
Already tipped you.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.320
Great.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.680
Oh my god...

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.760
Hello?

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.080
Hello, this is Lidai Designated Driver.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600
I'm at the intersection.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.440
Where are you?

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.920
Are you the one

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.840
with the phone ending in 5151?

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.560
Hello?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.040
Hello, yes?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880
I'm the driver you called.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.920
If you have anything you want to ask,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.400
just go ahead.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.440
Stop pretending you don't know.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.960
You know exactly what I want to ask.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.000
Then at least tell me first,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.640
why did you come back?

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.120
Kuang Dazhi's personal guarantee

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.040
fell apart.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.200
My work visa was cancelled.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.360
I'm sorry.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.320
It was my own mistake.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.880
I didn't understand anything

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.320
and trusted people way too easily.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.480
I'm really sorry.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.600
The crowd around me back then was too messy.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.360
I never thought

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.080
Kuang Dazhi was a conman.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.240
I only just learned

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.840
about all this.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.400
But right now I don't know

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.160
how to make it up to you.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.480
If you really had nothing to do with Kuang Dazhi,

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.720
why did you disappear?

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.920
Actually, something happened

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.920
at home.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.640
So I had to come back.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.480
What happened?

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.600
Can you tell me?

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:14.960
It's hard to put into words.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:18.480
Ge Kaiyang,

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.000
do you think this is funny?

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.600
You can't even be bothered

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.560
to make up a proper lie anymore.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.680
Back when you were acting in plays,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.480
you weren't like this.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.960
I haven't even figured it out myself,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.440
so I really can't explain it clearly.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.320
That night,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.480
after I drove you home,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.240
I got dragged to a friend's

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.040
birthday party.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.480
It doesn't work.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:23.960
Put it on my tab.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.600
Okay.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.160
Thanks.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.280
Charlie.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.000
You scared me.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.160
What are you doing?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.200
We're waiting for you to drink.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.840
Just replying to a message.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.760
You go ahead.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:38.760
Girls?

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.600
Let me see. Do I know her?

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.560
Is she hot? Let me see.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.360
Hey, hey, stop it.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.520
Quit messing around. I'll be right there.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.800
Listen,

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:46.920
I've been looking

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.480
for a chance

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.440
to talk about Wang.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.200
Remember him?

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.000
Yeah.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.640
The one

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.920
who went after Gui's ex.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.280
His whole family,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.360
uncles, aunts, even his mom,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.560
for running a scam ring.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.000
The police took them in one sweep.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.160
I knew that guy

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.880
was always pretending to be rich,

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.720
always insisting

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.520
on opening a whole bottle by himself.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.560
Look at him now.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.120
He even pulled this...

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.280
Forced her

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.760
to give back

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.920
all the gifts.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.880
Talk about embarrassing.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.960
What if he really had no money?

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.000
Remember Olsen,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.440
two years ago?

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.040
The moment they got wind of it,

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.840
they borrowed money from everyone

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.440
and ran.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.320
That's how they do it,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.960
delete WeChat, vanish, gone.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.000
It's fine.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.680
You go ahead. I need to take this call.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:33.680
Alright.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.440
Hurry up, everyone's waiting for you.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.680
Hello?

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.280
Hello.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.080
Is this Ge Kaiyang?

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.960
I'm your parents' defense lawyer.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.640
last name Luo.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.560
Last night, your parents were arrested

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.440
at home by the Economic Investigation Unit

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.480
of Lucheng Public Security Bureau.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.080
All assets and accounts under their names

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.160
have been temporarily frozen.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.560
Your personal bank accounts

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.800
may also be frozen soon.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.280
If anyone contacts you recently

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.160
to ask about the situation,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.280
please inform me immediately.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.560
Do not have any contact

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.200
with anyone on your own.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.800
It could affect the case.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.080
This number

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.040
is my personal cell.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:07.600
Got it.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.160
I'll save it.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:09.840
Good.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.200
You fucking liar...

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.680
Charlie. Come on.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.040
Everyone's waiting. Just stop texting.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.360
I just bought a bottle,

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:23.920
let's take it over.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.440
Alright, alright.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.000
It's someone's birthday.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.760
I'm bringing the booze.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.840
Let's go, let's go.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.960
We can't start without you.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:33.960
Here we come.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.160
Charlie's coming.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.360
[At first]

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.680
[I thought it was a scam call.]

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.560
[Then I realized it was real.]

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.600
[My dad had become a fraudster.]

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.800
[I booked a flight home that same night.]

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.320
[I even borrowed money for the ticket.]

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.360
Stop drinking. Have this instead.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.480
After everything I just told you,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.120
you still don't believe me?

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.440
Didn't you always say life is a play?

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.679
I really can't trust a word you say anymore.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.280
Don't drink the rest.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.400
If you get wasted,

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.360
it'll be dangerous going home alone.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.520
I still have more rides later,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.440
I won't be able to drive you.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.720
Ge Kaiyang,

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.720
you still don't understand

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.200
what ordinary people's lives are like.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.320
You ruined me like this.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.840
Do you think

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.560
I can still go home?

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.760
Then let me stay with you a bit longer.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960
You're unbelievable.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.400
I'm already in this state,

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.240
and you still won't tell me the truth.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.360
Lu Xinying, everything I told you

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.240
is the truth.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.560
I thought I'd finally found someone like me.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.360
Turns out you're the real liar.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.080
Why don't you come to my place right now

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:56.640
and see for yourself

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.280
what the situation is?

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.160
Then you'll know if I'm lying.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.480
Come in.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.560
You still have a little dog?

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.320
Yeah.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360
His name's Happy. I had him when I was little.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.400
By now he's old.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.160
We just don't say it

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.000
to him.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.040
Still up?

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.800
This is my friend.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.920
Give me the stuff.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.120
Thanks.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.200
Make yourself at home.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.160
Hungry?

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.240
Want something to eat?

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:11.960
Whatever.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.080
After my parents got in trouble,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.760
I moved in with my grandma.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.600
It's a bit messy,

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.320
just sit anywhere.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.400
Sit.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.520
You saved me

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.360
tomato-egg noodles?

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.920
Go to bed early, okay?

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.960
Can she stay over tonight...

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:30.720
Sit.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:31.880
It's fine.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.560
So ever since you came back,

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.800
you've been living here?

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:47.920
Yeah.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.440
If everything you said is true,

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.200
then why

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.760
didn't you just tell everyone the truth?

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.280
That way people could actually help you.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.640
This is just how things are for me right now.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.240
I have to settle myself first

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.640
and take care of my grandma.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.480
I'm sorry

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.800
for dragging my bad luck onto you.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:33.800
Eat first.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.040
The noodles are getting soggy.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.560
Eat.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.040
Good boy.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.480
Perfect. You're so good.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.360
Good, good, good.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.120
Baby.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.760
Eat up.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.640
Good.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.280
Could you please stop

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.480
turning off the fan every morning?

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.040
What time is it?

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.120
Check your phone yourself.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.760
Still not getting up?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.160
I've already finished breakfast.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.720
Is that mine?

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.360
If it was for the dog I'd have put it in the bowl.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.800
Why do you always have to

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.560
pick on me first thing in the morning?

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.960
This girl doesn't talk much.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.440
That's good.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120
Just regular friends

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.520
hanging out here for a bit.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.800
Really just regular friends.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.240
The term deposit has matured.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.440
Take it.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.800
I have money. I don't need yours.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.200
When you go out with a girl,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.280
don't let her pay.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.320
If she really doesn't mind you,

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.480
treat her well.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.640
Money won't change

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.200
how she feels about me.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.760
Happy...

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.360
Should I send it or not?

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.520
I'm really gonna send it.
