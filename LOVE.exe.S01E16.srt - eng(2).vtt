Welcome to the Hangang University President's Cup...

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.720
- Right this way. - Convergent App Contest.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.020
- Director, thank you for your work. - You too, sir.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.090
Yes, of course.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.790
Well, if it isn't CEO Lee.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.130
The busiest man in all of Korea graces us with his presence.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.399
- It's over here. - Please turn...

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.240
your cell phones off or switch them to silent mode.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.440
- To ensure the event runs smoothly, - Nisha. Hey.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.740
- Please, no outside food or drinks. - Nisha, over here.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.280
Today, may your passion and...

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.420
If we fail to foster interdisciplinary convergence,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.990
we can't handle the turbulent waves of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.830
- A top model who perfectly... - Joo Yeon San!

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.159
I heard Split Alarm crashed...

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.190
because you kept editing until the last minute.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.900
Are you even going to be able to present today?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.200
I heard Very Berry just passed 300 users.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.400
But our servers have never crashed. Not once.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.640
Split Alarm has 8,200.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.840
I guess that's the Kang Min Hak effect?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.610
And our average response time is now 1.1 seconds.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.980
So don't you worry about us.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.950
Let's just say Kang Min Hak is busy. Kang Dong Won got expelled.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.460
And Yang Na Rae is boycotting it because her friend is?

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.430
You keep saying "we," so why are you the only one here?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.760
Instead of attacking the school during a financial crisis,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.330
shouldn't we find a way to overcome this together?

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100
(Hangang University)

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.410
Rather than pushing your selfish agenda and hurting other students.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.340
I only filmed for one day.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.610
How'd they make it look so natural, as if I actually said all that?

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.520
This stuff is commonplace now. Basically, what they do is...

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.450
Excuse me, are you two getting hungry?

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.220
This tech is incredible, right? It's based on deep learning,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.190
so we can dub it in other languages for overseas markets.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.530
That's not the point. You said if we did this, he'd be on set less often.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.700
You said this was for his benefit, but then...

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.100
you use AI to just make him say whatever you want.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.340
Not "whatever." You agreed to it for all Hangang Group promotions.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.810
So I should just accept it, whether it hurts his image or not?

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.310
If you think being an ambassador...

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.480
for the Hangang Group may hurt his image,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.550
then maybe it's best not to do it. Don't you think?

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.620
I mean, this whole thing is a bit out of his league anyway.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.420
We made a generous offer because he's a student...

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.190
at Hangang University, but I really didn't think...

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.760
he'd be this uncooperative.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.330
Used to be an influencer. He has no idea.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.300
Seriously, speaking that mumbo-jumbo right in front of us.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.800
You just badmouthed him, didn't you?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.870
Min Hak is now a model for a group we represent.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.540
Why would we ever do anything to hurt his image?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.680
We'll run everything by you first so you don't have to worry.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.980
And what if I disagree?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.450
Then we'll discuss it and find a compromise.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.660
Right. Did you see the press release?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.190
This new ad with Min Hak is already sparking dating rumours.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.260
I got it on the front page of Section News for you.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.200
It's just one page in the back.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.570
What? "Rideshare Romance," Season three?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.540
Isn't she a junior from your school? Wow, they're fast.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.610
The teaser is already out...

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.380
By the way, how did Jinny's old team end up working for Hangang Group?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.620
Well, we specialise in branding.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.950
As for Jinny, we decided to part ways.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.160
Anyway, don't worry about this anymore.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.000
What's up with Quiz King? I heard a friend of yours got kicked out.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.809
I really didn't say that.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.310
You know I'd never say something like that.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.180
Dong Won and Na Rae know that too.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.750
Things are just a little rocky right now.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.390
- About Chang Yi's offer... - It sounds like a good opportunity.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.990
From what Na Rae was saying.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.530
If it's a good opportunity, take it. Don't let it pass you by.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.870
That's the logical thing to do.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.370
Logical?

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.010
The other day, when you were talking to him over beers,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.380
you looked really into it.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.550
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.150
It's okay.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.220
I didn't tell you something either, you know.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.960
I guess I felt a little guilty about it.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.960
Why the long face? This is a good thing.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.530
Come on.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.670
But then...

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.340
what's going to happen to us?

I got your documents. They seem okay to submit as is,

but on your application...

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.600
The part about Hangang University.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.700
Yes.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.270
I was thinking maybe we should take that part out.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440
Why?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.010
I don't think your university work will be much of a selling point.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.350
You should add a research project or "The Cloud Dream of the Nine."

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.950
The lab would probably find that more interesting.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.450
Anyway, we can talk more about this later.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.860
I haven't seen your friends around.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.890
Did something happen?

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.760
We had a fight.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.440
Your project must be very good. People always fight over good ideas.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.510
Everyone starts thinking it's all theirs.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.110
They get greedy.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.180
The awards ceremony will be held after all presentations have ended.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.780

Strictly speaking, you're not a student here anymore.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.380
And I'm filing a suit to have it nullified.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.780
But does that give you the right to block me from entering?

None of the others have a ramp.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.390
And now you've blocked this one too, just for some contest guests.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.060
Sir, it's illegal to block a wheelchair ramp.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.570
Fine, I'll just use the restroom. I can do that, right?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.770
Gosh, why do you insist on using this particular restroom?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.070
- Because no other restrooms... - Because no other restrooms...

- are accessible! - are accessible!

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.640
I don't know anything about that. Take it up with the school.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.240
What are you talking about? The dean's in there right now.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.510
Perfect. We can go talk to him directly.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.949
I said no, there are a lot of important guests today.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.620
Even better. With an audience, he can't just blow us off.

This is so frustrating.

First, let's hear some words of encouragement from Dean Gi Myo Han.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.310
Please give him a big round of applause.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.890
Hello. I am Gi Myo Han. This contest...

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.420
is something I myself proposed to the university president.

- your pure passion... - Isn't Kang Min Hak coming today?

Hey, look. I think that's our school's LGBTQ+ Alliance.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.790
- They're just bothering the guard. - This is so annoying during finals.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.560
Whatever, just ignore them. Let's go.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.300
Hey. I think she's falling for you even harder amidst all this.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.770
No. From what I heard, she's liked me all semester.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.670
If things go south, your princess will save you, right?

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.940
She's an exiled royal herself now.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.980
- Is it serious with your neighbour? - Na Rae.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.750
What are you all doing? Can't we get in because of this?

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.060
- Yes, give us a hand. - Gosh, what a cheap shot.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.220
Gosh, we'll be here all day trying to cut this.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.560
- Come over here. Yes. - Me?

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.830
- You guys grab it. - What? This thing?

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.900
- Let's lift it. - You want us to what?

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.970
- Grab it? - You, hold on tight.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.400
- Grab where? - We'll help you.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.900
- Thanks. Are we lifting it? - Grab on?

- Hey... - One, two, three! One, two, three!

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.810
- This contest... - Hey, be careful! Watch out.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.140
With 35,000 dollars in prize money and an overseas internship.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.880
Now, let's officially begin. Our first team is No Signal.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.120
Come on, a round of applause!

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.620
No Signal is an app that helps you erase all records of your ex...

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.120
by neatly scrubbing them from your social media.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.830
It can delete likes, comments, and photos from your trips together.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.500
It was inspired by a student team who broke up in this contest,

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.000
causing their team to split up.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.940
Our team considered what is most difficult...

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.110
for people who have just broken up.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.750
The conclusion we came to was the lingering traces of memories.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.280
Of course, we can't erase your actual memories,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.160
but we figured our technology could erase the digital traces.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.460
What? The buttons for floors above three won't work.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.190
Darn it.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.660
Let's get off on two. We'll take the stairs. All right?

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.230
The stairs? How are you going to manage?

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.070
It's fine. You can carry her again, right?

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.530
- Don't worry. I've got this. - Right, right.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600
Second floor. Go to two.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.150
Excuse us, coming through. We're students here.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.960
If you need to use the restroom, there's one over here.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.760
Hey, what's all this?

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.760
Students, you should go. People could get hurt if this lasts.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.070
But those guys are outsiders. Why are you stopping us students?

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.370
We just want to talk to the Dean! Let us talk to him!

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.270
- Damn it, move! Get out of the way! - Don't push! Stop pushing!

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.570
- Hey, knock it off! - What do you think you're doing?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.940
- Don't do this. apologise. - Hey, what is your problem?

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.010
Don't treat the students like this...

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.310
- Get out of the way! Move! - Sir!

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.380
- Hey! - Are you liable if people get hurt?

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.780
- Hey! - Get away from us!

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.579
The Dean must oust the contractors...

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.290
- threatening students! - Get them out!

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.520
- Drive out the contractors! - Drive them out!

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.790
- Get them out! - Help!

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.460
Very Berry analyses public reaction on social media and websites...

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.330
and visualizes it through our Strawberry Index.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.730
The top one percent, like the Dean, are called a Golden Strawberry...

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.940
or what we call a "Golden" for short.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.210
How often to say "esteemed Dean" in a five-minute pitch?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.980
- I know, right? - I'm a judge, so don't overdo it.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.350
Ban Ji No, please continue with your presentation.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.350
What? So no one's hurt?

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.020
Yes.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.090
(President's Cup Convergent App Contest)

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.460
What's that noise?

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.160
- Don't push me! - What are they saying?

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.600
I'll be right back.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.870
All right, let's focus.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.310
Yes. Also, Very Berry goes beyond simple analysis of figures.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.950
It analyses candidates and parties. Right after a policy is announced...

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.050
we can measure the shifts in public opinion.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.820
Yes, Professor Eum Nan Sae.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.220
So you're saying it analyses things other than people?

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.190
- That's right. - How would Hangang University rank?

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.300
Hangang University?

(Dawn: Live from Jang Yeong Sil Hall Lobby)

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.190
The Dean must oust the contractors threatening students!

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.560
- Drive out the contractors! - Drive them out!

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.120
What about San?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.360

(Hangang University App Contest)

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.100
Now for Hangang University's index, led by our own Dean Gi Myo Han.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.710
I'm expecting a very high score.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.310
(Hangang University, Analysing...)

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.240
Rotten Strawberry. Overwhelmingly negative response.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.950
- "Get out of the country." - That was clearly a bug.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.380
After our beta launch, we'll include user reviews...

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.290
which will allow us to upgrade the Strawberry Index...

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.920
through an AI consulting service we're also preparing.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.330
So even if something is a Rotten Strawberry now...

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.400
Connecting to real-time trends related to Hangang University...

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.230
- Get them out! - Why is it doing that?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.900
Why does it keep autoplaying?

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.040
- Aren't those our students? - Just a moment.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.940
- Why are you showing us this? - I said, expel them!

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.710
- What the? - Did they just hit a student?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.420
Are they insane?

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.350
What the heck do they think they're doing?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.560
That concludes the presentation for Very Berry.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.160
- Thank you. - Seriously, what was that?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.400
A bug? I mean...

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.940
Everyone, do you know the origin of the word "bug?"

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.140
Our Computer Engineering students surely know this already.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.210
It comes from Grace Hopper, the creator of the COBOL language.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.980
While fixing a computer error, she found a moth inside it.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.350
An actual bug. And that's where the term came from.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.290
Those students you just saw...

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.520
are exactly like that bug.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.160
A few radical students have invaded our sacred school...

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.500
and are disrupting the peace on campus like this.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.630
But we are dealing with it, so there's no need to worry.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.070
All of you should just focus on your own work.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.110
Now, we will continue with the presentations.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.850
Our final presentation is from team Split Alarm.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.390
Applause.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.590
And that's when it hit me.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.299
I once consulted on a campus drama...

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.530
set in a Computer Engineering Department.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.800
What if this were just a TV scene, written by a liberal arts major...

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.610
who doesn't know the first thing about engineering?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.040
And what if...

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.980
I was the main character in that show?

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.890
Hey, you son of a gun! I have so much things pent up.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.720
But I've said nothing about school. I'm keeping my mouth shut, aren't I?

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.620
So why don't you just shut up?

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.490
Aren't we all in this mess because of you?

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.200
If you hadn't messed our school up like this!

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.740
I'd storm out, shut Gi Myo Han up, and run to my friends...

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.540
- that would be my big payoff scene. - Split Alarm.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.670
- But... - The Split Alarm team.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.340
- Yes. - Split Alarm.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:49.780
Yes, they're moving forward. This team's been through so much...

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.320
That impulsive, emotional choice is only possible in a drama.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.490
I decided to stick to handling...

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.990
the most urgent and important issue at hand.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.660
It's Yeon San.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.530
Hello, everyone. We're Team Split Alarm...

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.100
I'll be presenting alone today, so please bear with me.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:18.339
Yes, Split Alarm is a must-have app for anyone currently in love.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.240
Even if it can't prevent a breakup,

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.810
knowing when it's coming might make it a little less painful.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.890
Split Alarm warns of a breakup. The presentation starts now.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.150
That's not it.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.260
Excuse me?

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.160
It's not called Split Alarm because it's an alarm for a breakup.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.960
It's an alarm that opens your eyes so you don't lose someone precious.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.100
That's the real meaning of Split Alarm.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.640
When someone you cherish starts to drift away from you,

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.370
that's when...

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.380
When the person I like starts to drift away from me,

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.620
an alarm or something would go off.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.350
It'd give you a chance to save it. Or at least...

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.620
give you time to accept it.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.320
When a relationship grows distant,

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.330
there are always signs.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.800
The problem is we often miss them until it's too late.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.500
And by then, there's no turning back.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.110
Just like you can't light a stove after the gas runs out,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.780
or how a wet match won't light.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.150
So, before our emotional fuel runs out...

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.780
and we reach the point of no return,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.390
we need that heads-up.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.519
And what about you two?

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.360
Do you even care about what I'm doing?

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.190
Maybe it was...

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.560
her way of asking me to be there for her more.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.460
Right. Even with such worries,

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.200
I forgot you keep to yourself. I guess I was the one overreacting.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.370
Or a sign that she wanted us to be closer.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.440
If it's a good opportunity, take it. Don't let it pass you by.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.210
That's the logical thing to do.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.750
Or perhaps,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.379
you'll get the chance to see the feelings they've been hiding...

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.490
you never knew were there.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.830
And so, you slowly start to retrace your steps.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.790
"What's going on right now?"

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.630
"How did our relationship get to this point?"

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.400
"What were the signs I was missing?"

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.970
You start debugging.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.410
(President's Cup Convergent App Contest)

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:42.090
"Love Debugging." How about that instead of Split Alarm?

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.290
The name sounds a little tacky. You know what I mean?

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.400
If you happen to switch to my idea, do you think I'll get a stake in it?

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.000
Just kidding.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.510
You called my friends "bugs," didn't you?

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.210
The real bug...

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.650
is you, Dean Gi Myo Han.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.360
They can't even clean this up? Unbelievable.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.600
Any student causing a disturbance is subject to expulsion.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.830
- They're the ones causing a scene! - What's happening?

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.710
- Get this on camera, quick. - Hey, don't film this! I said stop!

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.380
You hit me. You just hit me, didn't you?

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.150
I didn't hit you. You're the one who hit me!

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.550
I'm reporting you for assault. I'm calling the police.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.390
- Stop filming. - Hey, film this.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.290
All Department of Modelling students, leave now and go to your workshop.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.290
Anyone who doesn't go gets an F.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.930
But you won't give our department a proper studio.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.430
We always have class in the lounge, so why are you blocking us here?

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.000
You're all supposed to be walking down runways,

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.500
so what are you doing causing trouble here?

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.400
- We're students, too. - That's enough, Professor.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.000
- Block them. - What do you think you're doing?

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.170
- Wait a minute. - I said stop recording!

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.840
- I said stop recording! - It's illegal to record this!

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:15.050
- Stop recording. - This is so unfair. I'm so furious.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.410
- Why are you filming this? - I told you to stop!

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.920
What did we do to deserve this?

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.620
Those idiots!

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.790
Are you a member of that Emergency Committee too?

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.400
The one disrupting the school with illegal protests?

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.900
Now that I take a closer look,

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.840
I see an expelled student's name on this team's roster.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.710
They're against the school, but still enjoy its benefits.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.280
Such classic Gen Z entitlement. One was expelled for terrorizing.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.420
A team that includes an expelled student...

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.320
Doesn't that make them ineligible?

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.720
Well...

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.060
Well? Isn't it?

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.230
Such grounds for disqualification...

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.300
were never announced.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.000
So it doesn't apply.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.110
I knew you marched to your own beat, Professor Eum, but...

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.310
but as an educator, you should cooperate more. Honestly.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.720
You know...

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.550
don't fight so hard to hold on to things here.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.620

That there was no point in forming attachments.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.280
All I thought of was leaving sooner. But...

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.880
on this shabby campus...

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.150
I realised I've actually done quite a lot.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.130
Waiting for the shuttle with my friends,

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.790
telling stupid jokes,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.530
getting all excited over some worthless idea,

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.639
the late-night snacks we ordered during all-nighters.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.770
The all-night conversations.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.140
All that time we spent together.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.340
All those pointless moments.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.820
They became valuable data.

What?

Is this about that guy from the Department of Modelling?

You're in your prime, you know? I'm not saying to rush things, so...

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.450
Don't get carried away by emotions. Let's think this through carefully.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.720
Just from hearing him talk when we were out for drinks,

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.590
the way he talks is kind of a turn-off.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.090
And he's just so immature.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.060
Are you going to waste your time on someone like him?

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.130

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.740
- What? - He acts on his feelings.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.110
He doesn't play games or test the waters.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.320
He's secure enough to know when to yield.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.890
If he's wrong, he's not embarrassed. He's the type to just fix it.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.720
He's different from me.

Oh, right.

But, Min Hak, as for your personal opinions,

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.850
you should probably learn to keep them to yourself.

- What? - Min Hak!

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.690
You were planning on using me to sway public opinion, right?

To undermine my friends protesting against the school.

If I really have even a little bit of that influence,

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.970

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.870

As per the contest's theme, I have to say what's on my mind.

These days at our Hangang University,

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.420

A school you're embarrassed to tell people you go to.

A school whose jackets sell better without the school's name on them.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.140
A forsaken punishment pit on the outskirts of the Seoul area.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.710
Where if you miss one shuttle bus, you have to wait a whole hour,

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.580
a school with no real vision and no future.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.850
So, in some people's eyes,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:10.050
it may be a corrupt, 3rd-rate school with low admission standards, but...

those students with "wrong ideas" that you mentioned, Dean,

That's right. I'd say it reflects the president's divine intuition.

Is that how they decided on what to merge? Unbelievable.

So it could have been our department instead of CompSci.

- It'll be sooner. - What?

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.600
How did you calculate that?

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.630
I based it on the Tipping Point from the IPCC Scenario and...

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.700
That's not what's important right now.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.670

After that night, I lost touch with many comrades.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.640
We were dragged before the committee and we informed on each other.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.050
In the end, people were expelled or dropped out and left Korea.

We have a good time together, right?

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.660
Our dates were fun, too.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.100

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.740
how should I describe what we are?

It's more than a friendship,

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.210

Don't get me wrong,

Na Rae, you're incredibly charming.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.320
It's true I had a crush on you.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.530
For the record,

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.170
this has nothing to do with your identity.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:58.230
But...

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.070
I just don't think this is love.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.230
Were you planning to build a shelter to live by yourself?

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.070
A one-person shelter?

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:38.770

But that was the plan last year.

If sharing a kitchen and bathroom is better for energy conservation,

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.220
then connecting several one-person shelters...

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.120
and living with others might not be a bad idea.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.030
- Have you tried Split Alarm? - What?

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.500
What do you think the problem is?

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.800
I keep making adjustments and thinking it over.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.540
I think our biggest problem...

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.850
is a lack of data.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:20.350
That might be why it can't get an accurate read on us.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.150
A lack of data?

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.990
That's just my hypothesis.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.930
And now I have to test and verify it.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.600
Which means we should keep seeing each other.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.240
What about going to the US?

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.040
I'm not going.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.670
Because of Split Alarm?

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.180
To test your hypothesis?

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.750
Or maybe...

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:54.050
is it because of me?

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.820
As if.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.260
But...

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.930
I might really be out of a job now.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:05.160
I have to pay a penalty fee,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.300
and I still haven't done my military service.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.640

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
