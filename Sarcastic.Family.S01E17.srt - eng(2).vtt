00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.519
Why are you still counting every day?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.480
Are you that desperate to go back?

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.719
I’ve had more than enough here.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.159
Do you want to go back with me?

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.079
I’m not going back.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.159
My work here isn’t finished yet.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.240
Besides,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.000
I can’t just abandon Mengmeng.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.280
Let me put it this way.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.560
Ask those humans this:

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.599
Suppose a biologist

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.759
goes into a forest to study monkeys,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.759
and in the end,

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:22.840
falls in love with a monkey

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360
and even lives with that monkey,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.120
wouldn’t they think

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.800
that this biologist is insane?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.280
Mom, that’s really not okay.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520
How can you compare Mengmeng to a monkey?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.879
Right.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.680
Okay, fine, fine.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.639
He’s not even as good as a monkey.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.840
If it really doesn’t work,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.000
you can just take him with you.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.919
But let’s be clear first:

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.159
according to our home planet’s

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.919
entry requirements,

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.080
someone like him

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.199
has to be treated as

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.280
pet cargo.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.639
That won’t do.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.960
And what about his dad?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.879
He’s so old already,

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:49.879
you can’t put him in a cage.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.319
His dad won’t work.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.039
Exactly.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.960
His dad counts as

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.919
an invasive harmful species.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.360
He must be destroyed at entry.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.000
In Kaifeng there’s Bao Qingtian,

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.719
stern and selfless, sorting good from bad.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.240
I wrote this lyric at twenty.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.599
It’s actually quite fun.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.919
Clouds are Heaven kneading dough,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.800
planes are delivery guys,

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.800
passengers are dumpling filling.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.080
To Guiying.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.800
Who wrote this to Hanghang’s mom?

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.960
Dear Guiying,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.759
this time meeting you

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.599
is destined to stay with me for life.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.479
January fifteenth,

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.479
same old place for the two of us.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.000
Be there, or it’s not over.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.240
Liu Jie,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.680
uh,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.560
y-y-you

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.000
come to my pet shop right away.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.039
Yes, yes.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.560
It’s urgent.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.159
Really urgent.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.840
Come right now.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.240
Right now.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.680
Yeah.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.280
Earth Observation Log.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.240
If Earth exploded,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.319
where would humanity go?

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.079
In Quadrant Three of Andromeda,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.319
a massive explosion occurred.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.519
The Interstellar Alliance sent beacons

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:24.720
to 17 stars within 30 light-years.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.439
At the observation coordinates in

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.839
Quadrant Three, a fierce cosmic blast was seen.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.360
The star was ultra-dense.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.120
Chief Editor,

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.720
Chief Editor, are you there?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.240
Matter is drawn from the companion star,
forming jets.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.000
Why is there no signal?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.319
Chief Editor?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.480
Chief Editor?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.560
Chief Editor?

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.240
You have completely lost contact
with the home planet.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.360
Connection cannot be restored.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.399
You have completely lost contact
with the home planet.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.319
Connection cannot be restored.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.879
In Sector 54-32-9,

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.920
17 stars may face total destruction.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:04.279
Liu Jie

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.920
Back then, Guiying

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.399
got along best with you.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.480
Let’s be honest.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.000
The one who wrote this letter,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.720
said he’d come to my place to see her.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.439
Who was it?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.759
You and Guiying

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.399
have been divorced for years.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.000
Why still care about this?

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:22.720
I get it.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.199
Biaozi?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.199
No.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.319
Big Head?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.680
Big Head is my husband.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.560
Then who?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.480
Who on earth is it?

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.000
It’s…

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:36.120
All right, all right.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.920
Stop guessing wildly.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.240
I’ll lay it out for you.

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:42.360
It’s Zhiqiang.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.279
Hou Zhiqiang.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.120
Hou Zhiqiang, the boiler guy.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.800
Right.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:50.079
He and Guiying

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:52.839
were childhood sweethearts.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.399
When they were in school,

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.959
they did have a thing.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.759
But later on,

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.319
you cut in and stole her away.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:00.120
So,

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.000
while I wasn’t home,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.519
behind my back,

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.240
they picked things up again.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.720
Those two…

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:04.959
This letter

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.279
was written thirty years ago.

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.360
You brooding over this now,

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.560
does it mean anything?

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:11.720
It doesn’t.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.800
It really doesn’t.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.680
Take a look.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
Look at the day they met.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.560
The meeting date:

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.240
January fifteenth.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.079
Right.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.680
What about it?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.120
Then…

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.759
this line:

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.160
“This meeting

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.519
I am destined to

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.839
never forget all my life.”

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:28.959
“Never forget all my life,” huh?

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.759
So what about that?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.480
Nothing.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.600
Liu Jie,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.319
sorry to trouble you.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.120
Thanks a lot, really.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.720
Go handle your things first.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.439
I’ll net two fish for you,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.519
let your grandson keep them.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.079
No need.

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.600
They’re really nice, though.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.600
I’m heading out.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920
Okay, okay.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.800
They met in 1993,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.560
on January fifteenth.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:57.680
Hanghang was in 1993

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.519
born on November eleventh.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.560
Exactly ten months apart.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:09.079
If you leave, go alone.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.199
Leave Hanghang with me.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.240
You still dare want this kid?

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.240
Does he have anything to do with you?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.000
Look at yourself—

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.319
do you look like a father?

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.319
Darn it

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.560
Mom

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.279
Mom, I need to tell you something.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.439
That Musk is insanely rich.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.519
He launches rockets every day.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.439
I only ever had one rocket.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.399
Old Gao gave it to me.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:50.519
And I kicked it away.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.199
Tell me,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.480
this Musk,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.560
fires rockets to send humans

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.199
off to other planets.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.079
If I tell Old Ma

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.399
aliens are already on Earth,

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:03.759
and ask him for 2 billion,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.759
that’s not too much, right?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.360
Mom, you’re money‑crazy.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.920
I want to tell you something.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.959
About our home planet...

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:13.360
Don’t mention the home planet.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.319
I miss home so much it’s crazy.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.639
I can’t hear anything about going back.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.920
The other day I heard

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.040
Fei Xiang sing that song,

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:25.839
“Clouds of home drift at the horizon,”

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.000
“they keep calling out to me.”

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:31.040
It blew up, it blew up.

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.240
It blew up.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.159
You already know?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.840
Y‑yeah.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.200
Of course I know.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.720
Isn’t it just that

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.679
Starship exploded?

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:44.919
No, Mom,

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:48.320
our home planet exploded.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.080
Mom...

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.039
We’ve got no home now, Mom.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.639
Look how useless you are.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.559
Cry here by yourself.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.519
I’m going out to buy things.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:15.960
Mom...

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.639
Looks like this Earth Observation Log

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.399
isn’t much use anymore.

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:57.200
Really, lucky in our misfortune.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:59.039
Good thing the three of us are here.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.120
That’s just fate.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.080
Yeah.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.879
If that’s the case,

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:08.879
I have to find a partner.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.879
After all, I’m S Planet’s

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.000
last remaining man.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.240
For our species to go on,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.399
I can’t even be faithful.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.759
I’ve got to date several.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:17.399
This mission

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.600
suddenly fell on my shoulders.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.559
I can only reluctantly become

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.799
an S Planet playboy.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.799
Shut that mouth of yours.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.159
Mom.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:31.720
I’ve figured it out.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.080
When in Rome,

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.559
do as the Romans do.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.360
Humans

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.159
hold memorials

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.440
when relatives die.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.159
I’ll also hold one

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.840
for my S Planet.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.039
What?

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.720
Our home planet is gone.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.039
We must settle down on Earth.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.559
That means we need even more money.

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.519
We have so many alien friends.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.840
Perfect chance to collect cash gifts.

00:10:57.879 --> 00:10:59.440
I’ll go contact Big Liu now.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.879
No wonder since childhood Meng Hang

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.159
kept saying he looks nothing like me.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:17.080
Our personalities are so different.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.320
I’m energetic and restless,

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.360
he’s quiet and calm.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.320
Our hobbies are totally different.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.519
I like rock music,

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.840
he likes pop.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.240
That’s what I’ve been saying.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.120
How could my kid

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.960
possibly like pop?

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:29.279
Besides,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.399
I drank every day when I was young.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.919
My fertility was already affected.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.759
What the hell is all this nonsense?

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.240
These satellites are like servant maids
buried with the dead.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.759
In the afterlife,

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:24.840
they’ll keep it company in orbit.

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:31.000
Dear friends and relatives,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.799
let us, in deepest sorrow,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.240
mourn Old Lady Planet S.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.080
Old Lady Planet S—

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:41.399
it’s personification,

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:42.480
makes her sound closer to us.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.720
Just like Earth people

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.639
all call Earth “Mother Earth.”

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:46.559
Due to a supernova explosion,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.799
she has recently

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.320
passed away, sadly.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.440
At the ripe age of

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:52.159
three point two billion years.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.320
Gone so young, really…

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.879
Old Lady Planet S

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:58.840
was born in 3.2 billion BC.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.639
Her life was full of hardship.

00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:01.879
In her youth,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.360
she went through eighteen

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.879
global great floods,

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:06.960
ten rounds of

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.240
tectonic plate shifts,

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:09.600
and nine

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:11.240
ice ages.

00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:13.000
In her later years,

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.759
she was widowed, sadly.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.080
Widowed? What’s that about?

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:18.559
Old Lady Planet S

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:20.799
wasn’t she a binary star?

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:22.120
Later the other one

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.120
did nuclear tests

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.919
and blew itself up.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.240
Her eight continents and
three great oceans

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.360
Right, right, right.

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:28.360
and through untold hardship

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:29.960
she nurtured life.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.159
Her descendants filled the world.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.799
Dad.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.120
You gave me a scare.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.679
You little rascal, you.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.240
Today my client’s coming
to our compound.

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:06.440
I’ll sit here for a bit,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.120
have some tea,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.639
and wait for him.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.320
Sit, sit, sit.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:08.799
Sit.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.480
Such a good kid…

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.240
Why is Heaven doing this to me?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.039
No.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.639
I can’t accept this.

00:14:21.919 --> 00:14:23.240
We must do a test.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:25.879
Dad.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.840
What tea is this?

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:30.480
That sounds so nice.

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:32.799
I love hearing that.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:33.960
Say it again.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.320
Okay.

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:36.320
Listen carefully.

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:39.000
What tea is this?

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:42.679
You little brat.

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:43.679
You’re just teasing me.

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:44.480
Aren’t you?

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:45.360
Not that line.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480
Which line then?

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:48.279
Didn’t you say one word before it?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.399
Didn’t you just call me “Dad”?

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:52.480
It made my heart feel so sweet.

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:53.919
Call me that again.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:57.000
If I call you again,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.519
do you dare answer me?

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.879
Why wouldn’t I dare answer?

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:03.240
You scared me with that bowl.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.159
Listen up.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:04.960
Dad.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.240
Dad.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:11.360
Dad.

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.120
Hurry, get in the bowl!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.080
You silly boy.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.399
What’s wrong?

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.480
Why do you seem so off?

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:24.799
No, I just—

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.000
I just suddenly

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.080
had a feeling.

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:29.039
In this whole lifetime,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.320
the times you call me “Dad”
are all fixed.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.360
Each call is one less to come.

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:34.600
Don’t talk nonsense.

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:35.519
Come here.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.120
Sit and stay with me a while.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.039
That’s exactly what I’m—

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:38.080
How am I talking nonsense?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.360
If you weren’t my real dad,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.840
I’d suspect you’re taking
advantage of me.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.919
At my age?

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.000
Me… taking advantage of you?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.120
You wouldn’t lose out, you’d even—

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.799
What are you doing?

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.120
Look, you’ve even got gray hair.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.559
Look.

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.360
All these years,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.879
I’ve only kept this one white hair,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.399
counting on it to make me look mature.

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:58.159
Oh, cut it out.

00:15:58.159 --> 00:15:59.320
In my eyes,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.279
you’ll always be a child.

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:01.919
You need to get some real rest.

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.399
You should—

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:05.559
I’ll make you some black sesame later.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.120
And you…

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.480
when your client comes later,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.159
if they see you there

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:12.440
hogging the AC and sipping tea,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.000
this deal of yours

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
will definitely fall through again.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.679
You’ve got a point.

00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:16.840
I’ll go out to greet them.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.159
Yes, yes.

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:18.240
You wait there for them.

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:19.679
Once you’re done,

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:20.639
you can drink all the tea you want.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:22.960
Slow down.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.679
Your tea is really good.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.600
You little punk.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.159
You’re just messing with me.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.080
Slow down.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.159
We must get this tested.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.320
Only then will I feel at ease.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.079
Now, let’s invite the family rep

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.720
to deliver a eulogy.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.519
Go on.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.799
Thank you all

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:18.799
for attending S Planet’s funeral.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.920
As the saying goes,

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:23.559
“The tree longs for calm, yet wind won’t cease.”

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.400
“The child wants to care,

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.799
yet the planet will not wait.”

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:29.240
S Planet

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.880
compared with the blue Earth,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.799
is not exactly beautiful.

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:35.240
But as the saying goes,

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:36.839
“A dog won’t hate a poor home,

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:38.759
a child won’t hate an ugly planet.”

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.160
For the three of us

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.680
who were nurtured there,

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:44.200
it is a great planet,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.480
a selfless planet.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:47.759
What?

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:49.440
No, a happy planet.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:51.480
To us,

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:52.960
it

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.000
is simply

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.680
beyond any language

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.960
that could ever express

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.519
our grief for S Planet.

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:23.880
I will

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.359
sing a song for everyone

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.839
to convey

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.240
my longing for my home planet.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.759
Beyond the Milky Way,

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:48.480
by a black hole’s edge,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.359
inside Andromeda,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.519
lies my home planet.

00:18:58.519 --> 00:18:59.079
Thank you.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.799
That was my wedding ring.

00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:06.680
It’s still smoking now.

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:10.880
At the world’s end,

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:14.160
at the edge of the sky,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.160
we remember it together.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.799
You’re welcome to give a gift of cash.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.920
Scan the code or pay in cash.

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:40.359
You’re welcome to give a gift of cash.

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:45.759
Scan the code or pay in cash.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.400
Scan the code or pay in cash.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.720
Genetic similarity:

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.079
95%.

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:28.279
Probability of paternity:

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.799
zero point

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.920
zero zero zero zero zero

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:34.440
zero one

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.480
Holding a funeral is exhausting.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.359
Tell me about it.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.799
But to be fair,

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.680
the result was pretty good.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.680
Exactly.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.880
Especially

00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:01.240
when we burned a whole paper Milky Way.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.160
That little show

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.119
was really fun.

00:21:05.279 --> 00:21:06.839
Your eulogy was nice too.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.799
You hardly ever praise me.

00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:11.119
Then let me praise you too.

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:13.599
You sang really well today.

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:15.039
And I noticed when you were singing,

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.279
there was a tear in your eye.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:17.640
You were truly sad.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.400
Right?

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.200
No.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.680
It’s just that

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.599
I still have savings back home.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.960
Some people, honestly,

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.160
fall for it and won’t admit it…

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.160
Dad.

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:44.319
Dad.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.119
What’s wrong, Dad?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.599
Nothing.

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:54.079
I just suddenly

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.440
felt like writing a song.

00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:57.240
What song?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.640
You’re crying writing it.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.200
It’s called

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.960
Zero point.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.960
Zero zero, zero zero, zero zero,

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.400
zero one kind of love.

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:08.599
That love sounds pretty weak.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.799
Weak?

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.000
At zero point,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.880
zero zero, zero zero,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.720
with so many zeros,

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:16.039
isn’t that basically nothing?

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.920
Dad, don’t cry.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.680
What’s going on?

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.119
Whose love is this about?

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:21.640
It’s… it’s…

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.160
I said the wrong thing, Dad.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:23.799
I said it wrong.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.000
Please don’t cry, Dad.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.960
Stop crying.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.119
What’s wrong with Dad?

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:30.640
Don’t listen.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.160
Come here, look.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.319
Dad is crying.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:34.839
Dad.

00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:36.519
What’s wrong?

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:36.960
Dad…

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.720
No, no, no.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.279
Don’t say that word.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.039
Dad.

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:41.160
Which word, Dad?

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.599
I don’t know.

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:43.160
Don’t say “Dad.”

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.119
The more you call me Dad,

00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:45.559
the more it hurts inside.

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:46.119
Don’t say that word.

00:22:46.119 --> 00:22:47.079
Dad, why does it hurt

00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:48.359
when I call you Dad?

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.000
I’m going out for a walk.

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:50.039
I’m going out for a walk.

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:50.759
I’m going out for a walk.

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:51.200
Dad.

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:53.559
Dad.

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:55.599
Why, Dad?

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.079
Dad, why can’t I call you Dad?

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:19.039
Stop that.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.680
What are you doing?

00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:22.559
How do you know the cu… cuckoo?

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:23.720
It is really darn it.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.599
It lays its eggs in magpie nests,

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:26.400
and makes the magpies

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.079
raise its babies for it.

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:29.240
Darn it.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.240
Are you crazy?

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:33.759
The magpies don’t even care.

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:34.920
Why do you care so much?

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920
Who says magpies don’t care?

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.119
They just don’t know

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.519
how the magpies feel.

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:39.559
Do you really get

00:24:39.559 --> 00:24:40.279
the magpies’ pain?

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.400
Do you truly understand?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400
Do you?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.039
Do you get your phone is ringing?

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:53.559
Old Meng,

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:54.839
this is Liu Jie.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.880
My grandson killed those two goldfish fast.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.599
Got any longer‑lived animals?

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:04.119
Like you, Old Meng—

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.440
a turtle.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.559
No, no, absolutely not.

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:19.640
What do you need?

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:26.279
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:27.559
In-law,

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:28.880
you’re still not asleep?

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:32.039
Who says you must sleep at night?

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.319
You’re not sleeping either.

00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:39.119
I…

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:42.359
I just…

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:44.920
can’t fall asleep.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.759
What’s wrong?

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.519
Well…

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.920
I’ve run into a bit of

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:54.119
a small setback.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.720
Tell me about it.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.799
You seem worried too.

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:01.200
How about you go first?

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.240
My past is gone.

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:09.799
I’m about the same as you.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.079
My future is gone.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.720
Meng Hang.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.720
Why is Dad so weird today?

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.200
Yeah.

00:27:23.839 --> 00:27:25.240
I don’t know why either.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.759
I just remembered something.

00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:33.799
Li Cai told me today

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.559
Dad went to the hospital for

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:36.839
some test results.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.000
Could it be those results?

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:42.720
Dad.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.880
What’s wrong with you?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
You’re acting really strange.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.799
No, no.

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:46.519
I just…

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.839
I suddenly had a realization.

00:27:47.839 --> 00:27:48.519
It’s that…

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:50.240
The times you call me “Dad”

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.720
are all set by fate.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.799
Each time you call, there’s one less.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.960
In-law,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.880
we used to meet and

00:27:59.039 --> 00:27:59.920
always end up arguing.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.000
Today I feel like I woke up.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.640
Life’s like flowers in a mirror,

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:07.519
ever-changing, unpredictable.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:09.440
What matters most

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:11.119
is to cherish the present.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.279
I won’t argue with you today.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:16.720
Come on.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.240
From now on,

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.599
no matter my mood, good or bad,

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.720
I’ll always speak nicely to you.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.920
I’ll also try not to snap at you.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:40.680
Mom.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.119
Dad.

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:44.799
You two…

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:45.839
what are you doing?

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:47.240
We are…

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:50.680
No, no,

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:51.960
it’s just purely

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:52.920
revolutionary friendship.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.559
Right.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.160
Dad, be honest with me.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.480
Did you go to the hospital today?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.039
How did you know?

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.839
I heard it from Li Cai.

00:29:07.759 --> 00:29:09.160
Li Cai heard it from Old Wang.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.000
Old Wang heard it from Aunt Li.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.440
Aunt Li heard it from her niece

00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:14.880
who works at the hospital.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.400
Just tell me,

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.400
are the results not very good?

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.240
It’s okay.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.480
The bar’s mourning hall is still up.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:31.920
Mom.

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:36.240
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.000
I was afraid if I told you,

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.960
you’d stop seeing me as your dad.

00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:46.319
Nonsense.

00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:49.759
I’m your flesh and blood, your own son.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.720
Dad.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.440
What on earth is going on?

00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:55.359
If the results aren’t good,

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:57.160
we’ll figure it out together.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:57.920
Whatever it is,

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.079
we’ll face it together.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.160
Okay, I’ll tell you.

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:08.279
So, I…

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.960
I did a DNA test

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.920
for paternity with Hanghang.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.400
The genetic test says

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.160
Hanghang and I

00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:20.640
are not biologically father and son.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.200
What?

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.960
You keep eating GMO stuff.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.359
Your genes must’ve flipped.

00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:49.119
Stop making things worse.

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:54.000
Ninety‑five percent.

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:55.640
That shouldn’t be right.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.839
Humans and gorillas’ genes

00:30:57.839 --> 00:30:59.079
are 99 percent alike.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:30:59.920
See?

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:01.839
Told you Old Meng’s worse than a beast.

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:03.160
Can you talk properly?

00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:07.279
Dad, there’s definitely something off.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.519
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:09.960
Something’s definitely wrong.

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:11.960
Dad.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.720
Dad.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.519
Dad.

00:31:14.119 --> 00:31:14.680
Here.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.279
Look.

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:16.880
Look how alike we two look.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.119
How could we not be real father and son?

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.559
I’m not even half as paranoid as you.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.640
Can you calm down already?

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.400
Hanghang.

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:27.880
Don’t comfort me.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.559
Don’t comfort me.

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:29.119
It’s okay.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.559
If you still see me as dad,

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:31.920
then we’re still

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.640
family.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.400
If you don’t,

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.799
and want to find your real dad,

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.359
I won’t object.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.039
Your biological dad is Zhiqiang.

00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:41.720
If you want to “leave darkness for light,”

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.519
it’s okay.

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:43.200
You can go.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.720
From then on, call me Uncle.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.119
I’ll hold back my tears.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.960
You two, stop crying.

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:55.200
There’s definitely an issue with this test.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.440
You two, give me one more hair each.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.160
I’ll redo it.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.519
Trust science.

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.240
Trust what science?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.480
This agency’s definitely fake.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.079
This agency…

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:04.759
Stop crying.

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:10.200
Who’s Zhiqiang?

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:20.000
Is this necessary?

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:22.160
Is it worth wasting money on this?

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.559
You—

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:23.279
If you’ve got that money,

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.640
let Hanghang go join that

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.920
TV show “Waiting for You.”

00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:27.880
To look for his

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:29.839
real dad.

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:30.160
Wouldn’t that

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.000
be much better?

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.480
Dad.

00:32:32.839 --> 00:32:34.400
How is that not necessary?

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.359
This time we went to

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:37.759
the city’s most authoritative

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:39.160
professional testing center.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240
It’s guaranteed more accurate.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.960
The results will be here soon.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.559
They’re here.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:55.920
No, I…

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920
I’m a bit nervous, I…

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.559
I can’t press it.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.839
You do it.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.880
I’m not looking.

00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:03.960
Whatever the result,

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.640
it can’t change

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.039
the fact I’m my dad’s son.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:06.480
No, no.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.640
Hanghang, you must trust science.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.599
You do it.

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:10.200
I, I…

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.279
Fine, I’ll do it.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.559
I can’t do it.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.440
Look how spineless you are.

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:23.079
I’ll do it.

00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:25.160
Honestly…

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.480
I told you,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.400
you two don’t look alike at all.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.559
Turns out you are blood‑related.

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:01.480
Dad’s smiling.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.519
He fell asleep.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.599
Dad.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.760
What’s wrong?

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.519
Dad.

00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:16.599
Dad.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.199
Chief Editor.

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:40.719
What’s wrong?

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.599
Why’s our signal so good today?

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.559
Hold on a second.

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:46.679
I’ll connect the video signal.

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:52.960
Chief Editor

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960
What’s going on?

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:54.880
You…

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.920
You, the last couple days, you—

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.719
where did you disappear to?

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.480
Why couldn’t I reach you?

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.079
There was a stellar magnetic storm.

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:01.199
It knocked out signals planet‑wide.

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:02.440
It even burned out several satellites.

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:04.079
Our unit went on a group vacation.

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:04.840
They just fixed it.

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:05.360
No, that’s not it.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.800
I came back to tons of messages from you.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.559
What did you need?

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:08.119
You know…

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:12.719
well…

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.880
it’s nothing.

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:17.639
As long as you’re fine,

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.440
my sky is clear.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.800
A thunderbolt.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.880
To my mom, that’s a thunderbolt.

00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:27.599
Mom,

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.199
I’ve got good news for you

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:30.239
and some bad news.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.360
Good news: our home planet didn’t blow up.

00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:33.199
Bad news is,

00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:34.920
you have to return all the gift money.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.400
Wait, no—

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:36.519
so is that good or bad then?

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.039
Li Lili.

00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:38.480
Li—

00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:42.719
Let me share a secret.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.199
At the funeral, my mom

00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:46.119
waited till I wasn’t looking

00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:47.800
and secretly wiped away a tear.

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:50.079
I accidentally saw her do it.

00:35:50.559 --> 00:35:51.400
What does that mean?

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.159
Deep down inside,

00:35:53.159 --> 00:35:55.199
she’s actually soft‑hearted.

00:35:55.559 --> 00:35:57.320
For a moment I even felt guilty.

00:35:57.679 --> 00:35:58.760
Before this, I

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.320
actually thought she was cruel.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.159
Li Lili.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:01.679
About your card…

00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:02.760
I bought just a few things,

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.679
and it maxed out.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.760
You’re way too broke.

00:36:08.639 --> 00:36:10.719
So my old view of her was right.

00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:12.920
I’m sure of it.
