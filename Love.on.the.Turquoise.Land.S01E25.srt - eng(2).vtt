00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:56.767
Azure Scale Incense.

00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:00.287
During South Mountain Hunters' patrols,

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.927
mosquitoes swarm everywhere
and the terrain's uneven.

00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:04.368
It's hard to get proper rest.

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:06.088
So we carry this incense

00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:07.608
to help with sleep.

00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:16.287
I haven't lit it in ages.

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:18.727
It smells just like when I was a kid.

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:22.847
It's great.

00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:27.887
If...

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:30.648
If I'd had this in the mine,

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:33.407
it would've been more bearable.

00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:55.368
I'm sorry I couldn't rescue you sooner.

00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:57.727
You've suffered a lot.

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:04.727
Honestly,

00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:10.167
I can endure physical pain.

00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:14.607
It's the hopelessness

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:16.808
that eats you alive.

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:22.167
Before meeting you,

00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:24.328
I was just as trapped.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.648
Enduring, waiting,

00:03:31.447 --> 00:03:33.808
with no way out or escape.

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:38.407
Same as my mom back then.

00:03:46.447 --> 00:03:48.528
Mom, where are we going?

00:03:49.768 --> 00:03:51.968
We're taking a family trip with Dad.

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:57.768
(Marriage Certificate, Work Manual)
Where are we going?

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:02.127
Somewhere far away.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.336
(Ganzhou, Yunzhou,

00:04:20.568 --> 00:04:22.847
(First Waiting Room Departures)
Anywhere out of Yanguan.

00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:24.128
What's the earliest train?

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:25.247
To Ganzhou.

00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:26.328
Boarding in ten minutes.

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:30.208
And after that?

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:32.528
To Yunzhou at eleven o'clock.

00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:33.528
Which one?

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:37.648
Hurry up. The line's waiting.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.088
The eleven one.

00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:43.128
To Yunzhou at eleven.

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:43.927
How many tickets?

00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:45.167
Four.

00:04:45.287 --> 00:04:46.528
But Dad said

00:04:46.528 --> 00:04:48.807
to get tickets for the earliest train?

00:04:49.047 --> 00:04:49.847
Just wait.

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:51.448
We're leaving together.

00:04:52.448 --> 00:04:53.768
(Yunzhou East)
Here, two adults and two children.

00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:54.328
Hold these.

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:55.487
Okay. Thanks.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.678
(Bizhou, Departure 15:35)

00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:02.847
Sit over here.

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:03.648
Sit right here.

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.247
Scoot over inside.

00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:07.448
Look, ducklings.

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.407
Let's feed the ducklings.

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.128
Where are you going?

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:15.528
We agreed you wouldn't wander off.

00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:16.968
Sorry, Mom.

00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:19.807
We wanted to give them cookies.

00:05:20.807 --> 00:05:21.607
I see.

00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:23.208
Now stay close to me.

00:05:23.487 --> 00:05:24.407
When Dad gets here,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.088
he'll buy each of you a duck. Okay?

00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:26.807
Okay.

00:05:30.287 --> 00:05:32.768
I've never told anyone about this.

00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:45.487
Whatever it is,

00:05:46.968 --> 00:05:48.208
don't bottle it up.

00:05:49.927 --> 00:05:51.768
Talking might help.

00:06:11.247 --> 00:06:12.727
All aboard!

00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:14.407
Dashan, over here!

00:06:14.727 --> 00:06:15.528
Dashan.

00:06:15.648 --> 00:06:18.287
Mom, the duckling.

00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:19.047
Over here.

00:06:19.047 --> 00:06:19.568
Mom.

00:06:19.568 --> 00:06:21.167
- I'm here.
- The duckling.

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:23.448
Dashan, I'm here.

00:06:23.648 --> 00:06:25.328
Look at the duckling, Mom.

00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:26.888
Dashan, over here.

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:43.568
Tuo!

00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:44.528
Tuo!

00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:45.448
Xinxin!

00:06:45.994 --> 00:06:46.793
Tuo!

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.050
Tuo!

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:53.066
Xinxin!

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:55.907
(So much I thought I'd forgotten.)

00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:59.746
(Guess I didn't want to remember.)

00:06:59.946 --> 00:07:01.547
(Yunzhou)
(Selective amnesia, maybe?)

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.091
(But later,)

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.370
(when Mr. Changxi gave my mom's diary)

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.130
(to me,)

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.250
(every memory flooded in.)

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:29.290
Ms. Shuangxiu.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.690
I'm begging you.

00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:38.170
Give Xinxin back to me.

00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.290
I'll do anything.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.130
Anything?

00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.891
Yes, anything.

00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:52.451
I want Yan Huanshan.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.211
I want Roadsound Mine.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.810
And I also want

00:08:07.651 --> 00:08:08.610
you gone.

00:08:21.738 --> 00:08:22.699
Mr. Changxi told me

00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:24.659
everything about what happened next.

00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:31.339
He's really open with you.

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:35.299
Ms. Lu's quite open with you too.

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:45.219
That shows we're quite trustworthy.

00:08:52.219 --> 00:08:54.378
Since you've shared so openly,

00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:57.738
I'll share my childhood with you too.

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:01.699
That dirty old man?

00:09:12.074 --> 00:09:12.994
Do you know

00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:16.234
why I'm afraid of water?

00:09:21.234 --> 00:09:22.834
My mom was also a South Mountain Hunter.

00:09:23.873 --> 00:09:25.234
She went on patrol 20 years ago,

00:09:25.954 --> 00:09:26.994
ran into an Earth Fiend,

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:29.273
and never returned.

00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:33.714
My dad was heartbroken.

00:09:34.314 --> 00:09:35.633
He kept saying he'd go find her.

00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:38.273
My biggest fear back then

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:42.434
was that my dad would leave me too.

00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:53.153
Dad.

00:09:58.666 --> 00:09:59.507
Dad.

00:10:00.227 --> 00:10:02.227
Dad, weren't you taking me boating?

00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:04.546
Come over quickly.

00:10:05.147 --> 00:10:06.306
Dad.

00:10:08.027 --> 00:10:08.826
Come here.

00:10:31.754 --> 00:10:33.173
Dad, are you ready yet?

00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:06.234
Luo.

00:11:14.914 --> 00:11:16.673
Look, they're selling ice pops
over there.

00:11:18.274 --> 00:11:19.274
I'm thirsty.

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.634
Buy an ice pop for me

00:11:22.673 --> 00:11:24.394
and one for yourself too, okay?

00:11:29.234 --> 00:11:30.073
Okay.

00:11:54.826 --> 00:11:55.505
Luo,

00:11:57.505 --> 00:11:58.346
thank you.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.691
Here, little one.

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:44.730
Thank you.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.451
You're welcome.

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:54.036
(Ice Pop)

00:12:56.595 --> 00:13:01.779
(Deep Water; Risk of Drowning)

00:13:15.331 --> 00:13:16.211
Dad!

00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:17.610
Dad!

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:32.411
Dad!

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.411
Dad! Dad!

00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:40.211
Dad!

00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:44.571
Dad!

00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:48.530
Dad, come here, please!

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.490
Dad!

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.730
Dad, please come here!

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.490
Dad!

00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:01.971
Dad, come here!

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.931
(Thankfully, my dad was rescued.)

00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:13.370
(But he became a different person.)

00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:15.971
(From then on,)

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:17.850
(I've been afraid of water.)

00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:23.826
I'm sorry.

00:14:24.986 --> 00:14:28.545
I-I was terrible before.

00:14:35.978 --> 00:14:37.897
As a child, I didn't understand

00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:41.377
what 'severe depression'
on his medical record meant.

00:14:42.938 --> 00:14:44.617
I just knew he shut himself indoors

00:14:44.737 --> 00:14:46.017
and wouldn't eat anything.

00:14:47.537 --> 00:14:50.377
In the end, I still couldn't keep him.

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:10.563
The Laogong acupoint.

00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:13.002
My mom taught me.

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:24.113
Come on, time for school.

00:15:27.954 --> 00:15:28.833
What's wrong?

00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:32.993
Don't worry.

00:15:32.993 --> 00:15:34.873
You will be fine.

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:37.113
You've memorized that poem perfectly.

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:39.074
But, Mom,

00:15:39.274 --> 00:15:42.833
I've never recited it
before the whole class.

00:15:43.194 --> 00:15:44.194
I see.

00:15:44.674 --> 00:15:45.394
Alright.

00:15:45.794 --> 00:15:47.394
I will teach you a trick.

00:15:48.753 --> 00:15:50.394
Give me your hand.

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:56.233
This spot is the Laogong acupoint.

00:15:56.394 --> 00:15:58.113
When you're nervous or anxious,

00:15:58.113 --> 00:15:59.233
press here.

00:15:59.674 --> 00:16:01.593
It'll calm you quickly.

00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:03.873
Mom, it hurts a little.

00:16:04.314 --> 00:16:06.674
That soreness means it's working.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:10.314
Now try it yourself.

00:16:24.753 --> 00:16:27.554
Seems effective, Dr. Yan.

00:16:29.314 --> 00:16:30.753
I'm no doctor.

00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:36.113
We both lost our parents young.

00:16:36.713 --> 00:16:38.034
Just kindred spirits.

00:16:39.314 --> 00:16:41.434
More like therapy buddies.

00:16:42.074 --> 00:16:43.833
Don't say therapy buddies.

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:44.593
It's bad luck.

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:46.554
Okay.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.714
(No Entry)

00:21:51.073 --> 00:21:51.753
Shen.

00:21:53.394 --> 00:21:54.394
How is it down there?

00:21:57.154 --> 00:21:58.594
That humanoid Earth Fiend

00:21:59.713 --> 00:22:01.273
and Sun Zhou's corpse

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:03.273
are both down there.

00:22:03.273 --> 00:22:04.753
How many humanoid Earth Fiends exist?

00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:06.194
Why are they in this mine too?

00:22:08.114 --> 00:22:09.914
He must be the one named You Peng

00:22:10.154 --> 00:22:11.394
in the file.

00:22:12.954 --> 00:22:14.233
Hope they don't have a second

00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:15.114
or a third file.

00:22:16.674 --> 00:22:17.674
It's hard to say.

00:22:19.394 --> 00:22:20.634
But for now,

00:22:21.793 --> 00:22:22.793
Lin Xirou probably

00:22:22.793 --> 00:22:24.594
doesn't know what happened here.

00:22:27.073 --> 00:22:27.793
Shan Qiang

00:22:27.793 --> 00:22:29.033
has been using their phone

00:22:29.033 --> 00:22:29.954
to keep them updated.

00:22:30.473 --> 00:22:31.793
But it won't last much longer.

00:22:32.354 --> 00:22:33.594
They do regular inspections.

00:22:34.313 --> 00:22:36.233
Why don't we clean up down there

00:22:36.233 --> 00:22:36.993
to cover it up?

00:22:39.354 --> 00:22:40.473
That's unnecessary now.

00:22:43.586 --> 00:22:50.050
(Roadsound Mining)

00:22:53.874 --> 00:22:55.233
Any new discoveries?

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:03.073
The South Mountain Ocarina.

00:23:03.674 --> 00:23:05.273
Soil was taken from Turquoise Land

00:23:05.993 --> 00:23:07.914
and tempered with natural fire

00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:11.354
to craft an instrument with ten holes.

00:23:11.753 --> 00:23:14.594
Its five tones and eight sounds
govern heaven and earth

00:23:14.594 --> 00:23:15.993
with the Dao as its score.

00:23:16.513 --> 00:23:19.354
Humans follow earth, earth follows
heaven, and heaven follows Dao.

00:23:19.954 --> 00:23:22.993
Its profound sound
reaches the underworld.

00:23:23.753 --> 00:23:26.073
The underworld is where fiends dwell.

00:23:26.434 --> 00:23:30.394
Lurking beneath Turquoise Land,
they heed the ocarina's call.

00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:33.233
Humans and fiends share paths,
merging into South Mountain.

00:23:35.033 --> 00:23:36.033
Which book is this from?

00:23:36.513 --> 00:23:38.674
South Mountain Hunters' Miscellany.

00:23:39.594 --> 00:23:40.993
(The South Mountain Ocarina)
Humans and fiends share paths,

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:43.194
merging into South Mountain.

00:23:49.313 --> 00:23:50.713
Does the book mention

00:23:51.674 --> 00:23:52.793
where this thing is located?

00:23:53.922 --> 00:23:56.033
Village...

00:23:56.233 --> 00:23:56.793
Village...

00:23:56.993 --> 00:23:58.273
Village Four.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:55.938
(Open, Welcome)

00:24:56.066 --> 00:24:59.650
(Open)

00:25:12.674 --> 00:25:16.834
(Safety)

00:25:16.834 --> 00:25:19.233
I'll take this one then.

00:25:19.233 --> 00:25:20.473
Good choice.

00:25:20.473 --> 00:25:21.553
- Let's go.
- What?

00:25:21.793 --> 00:25:22.834
Take care.

00:25:22.834 --> 00:25:23.874
Don't look back.

00:25:28.594 --> 00:25:29.094
(Wake up.)

00:25:34.434 --> 00:25:35.674
You'll be free soon.

00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:38.834
Who are you really?

00:25:40.273 --> 00:25:41.394
Not a bad person, anyway.

00:25:42.954 --> 00:25:43.674
Give me your hand.

00:26:00.194 --> 00:26:03.778
(Lin Ling; How are you lately?)

00:26:14.018 --> 00:26:17.026
(Are you okay?)

00:26:18.018 --> 00:26:20.354
(I...)

00:26:54.274 --> 00:26:56.322
(To Mr. Yan)

00:27:29.442 --> 00:27:36.109
(Frostbite Ointment)

00:29:17.114 --> 00:29:17.834
Come in.

00:29:25.594 --> 00:29:27.713
Lin Ling and Mr. Changxi
know you're back.

00:29:28.354 --> 00:29:30.154
Do you want to say hello?

00:29:42.834 --> 00:29:43.594
I...

00:29:45.273 --> 00:29:46.434
I want

00:29:48.634 --> 00:29:49.434
a haircut.

00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:53.553
Sure.

00:29:54.713 --> 00:29:55.674
Eat your meal first.

00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:27.594
Don't worry. Just relax.

00:33:49.474 --> 00:33:51.434
(Peace and Joy, All Things Go Well)

00:33:51.434 --> 00:33:53.073
To some degree,

00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:54.434
a haircut is a sculpture too.

00:33:54.674 --> 00:33:56.834
Bit by bit, from outline to detail.

00:34:00.394 --> 00:34:01.033
How is it?

00:34:03.273 --> 00:34:03.874
Thanks.

00:34:06.874 --> 00:34:07.874
Time to shave.

00:34:10.834 --> 00:34:11.794
I'll do it myself.

00:34:18.834 --> 00:34:20.993
No rush. Take your time.

00:34:31.914 --> 00:34:33.073
The dumplings are ready.

00:34:33.794 --> 00:34:34.754
What are you doing?

00:34:34.754 --> 00:34:36.113
Cooking dumplings in the hot pot?

00:34:36.834 --> 00:34:37.993
For hot pot staple food,

00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:39.354
instant noodles are the best.

00:34:44.754 --> 00:34:45.394
Tuo.

00:34:49.673 --> 00:34:51.834
Is there room for me?

00:34:54.754 --> 00:34:56.473
Of course, we have room for you.

00:34:56.874 --> 00:34:58.234
Tuo, hurry and join us.

00:34:58.234 --> 00:34:59.673
The pot's boiling, Mr. Yan.

00:34:59.673 --> 00:35:00.394
Come join us.

00:35:00.394 --> 00:35:00.954
Okay.

00:35:02.954 --> 00:35:03.513

00:35:03.993 --> 00:35:04.633
Thanks.

00:35:05.033 --> 00:35:06.354
Come on. Take your seats.

00:35:08.434 --> 00:35:09.394
Sit down, everyone.

00:35:13.553 --> 00:35:14.593
Tuo, want some of this?

00:35:20.274 --> 00:35:22.394
Here, have some meat.

00:35:26.354 --> 00:35:27.434
Are they shooting stars?

00:35:29.633 --> 00:35:31.434
Yes, they are.

00:35:32.394 --> 00:35:34.033
So many. Must be a meteor shower.

00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:34.834
