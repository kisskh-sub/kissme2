=Episode 26=

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.620
Xiaoyu.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.818
The young master is getting weaker.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.778
I saw them going
into Canglong Pavilion again.

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.139
If he falls in there,
Zhilou won't have the Dragon God power.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.818
She'll be trapped inside

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.180
and never return again.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.218
What do we do?

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.938
It's going to be too late. It's too late!

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:22.938
Hunbao, don't panic.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.299
In the Dragon King's Decree,
there was once in the past

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.058
when humans summoned the Wujing Saintess

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.099
as she was in danger.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.259
The Dragon King's Decree

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.739
could summon the Wujing Saintess

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.419
back to a Saintess Altar

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.340
in Wujing.

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:43.580
That means

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.778
we can summon Zhilou

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.220
and the young master.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.818
The Saintess Alter of Wujing

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.020
is in the War God's Hall.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:50.699
Go with Xiaoyu.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.180
Take my token and the book.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.099
While no one's around, go.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.960
(Dongming)

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.939
Don't worry.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.139
I'll stall Liluo and my mother.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.099
Let's go.

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:19.859
You fool!

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.538
If these useless tonics worked,

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.780
would I need to drink Yue's blood?

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.859
Where is Yue?

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.180
Where is Feng Zhilou?

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:28.819
Have you caught them?

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.459
She's outside the city
with the Dragon Prince.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.859
It's impossible for them
to return before tomorrow.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.019
Before every thing's done,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.659
don't say it's impossible.

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.900
What if Feng Zhilou returns?

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.900
What if the prince doesn't return?

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:45.618
If he returns,

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.060
would he even willingly lead you
to the sanctuary?

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.938
You really are my mother.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.899
Since you've thought of it,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.580
I would've too.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.259
Come back!

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.979
Just what are you thinking?

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.500
That has nothing to do with you.

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.019
This tonic is expensive.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.060
I'm giving it to you

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.139
only because I don't want you

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.819
to die before I enter the sanctuary.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.739
Come back here!

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:25.260
Look.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.739
Even if you gained the right
to enter the sanctuary,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.419
other people still think

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:33.340
that you were abandoned by Chu Moshang.

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.178
For Feng Zhilou's sake,

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:37.179
he'd risk his life to return.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.099
Why?

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.338
Why would Chu Moshang

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:43.340
rather die than choose me?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.619
Look.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.340
What's this?

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.179
You've killed him.

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.220
This is my gift.

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.619
The Wujing Saintess

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.140
must be my wife.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.179
Alright.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.659
Once I'm the Dragon Queen,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.459
I'll kill Feng Zhilou

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.059
and everyone in Feng Village.

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:09.179
No one can stand in my way.

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:14.659
It'd be better if Chu Moshang
is included as well.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.499
Whether it's the throne

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.580
or the Wujing Saintess,

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:23.619
they're all mine.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.700
They can only be mine.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.020
That's because

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.780
only the victors

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.659
can write history.

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.299
You're right.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.299
We really are the same.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.980
(War God's Hall)

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:01.259
Li Yan proves helpful even now.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.859
Thank goodness we have his token.

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:07.499
Wind, fire, thunder, lightning.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.940
Swift as the wind,

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:10.419
striking like lightning.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.899
Wujing Saintess, hear my call.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.859
Come to me!

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.760
I knew it!
The Dragon King's Decree lies.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.059
Everything written here is a lie!

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.040
If anything happens to Zhilou
and the young master,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.859
I'll eat those two vile women!

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:33.700
Wind, fire, thunder, lightning.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.098
Swift as the wind,

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:36.380
striking like lightning.

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:39.539
Wujing Saintess, hear my call.

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.460
Come to me!

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.620
(Dragon King's Decree)

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.059
Xiaoyu!

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:55.859
Xiaoyu, are you okay?

00:06:57.859 --> 00:06:59.459
I just saw Zhilou.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.140
What do we do now?

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.020
(No matter what, we can't give up.)

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.459
Miss Zhilou,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.220
We're here with the Black
and White Envoys.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.579
He's weaker again.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.218
Where is he?

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:21.859
Where is he?

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.859
Based on what you've said,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.940
since Prince Shang is heavily wounded,

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.939
it'll be hard for him to recover

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.260
even with his dragon pearl.

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:33.899
You old coot!

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.459
What are you saying?

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.259
He just can't recover
without the dragon pearl.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.700
He would never die!

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:53.778
His Highness' reverse scale
turned into the sanctuary's sigil.

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:55.260
No one can touch it now.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.379
It defends and heals him

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.858
from the attack's damage.

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:00.658
But the sigil is now

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:03.859
with Feng Zhilou.
It can't be taken away.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.820
His Highness refuses
to kill Feng Zhilou,

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:10.019
so he can only be healed
with the dragon pearl.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.099
His soul is now
in the heart-guard scale,

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:14.819
but it's still with Feng Zhilou.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.419
Now that she's gone,

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:17.859
how can we heal him?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.059
The moment he
lost the heart-guard scale,

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.499
His Highness was likely

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.338
prepared to die.

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:25.699
He never thought
his dragon pearl would return.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.460
Enough.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.499
What's the use of saying that now?

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.460
His Highness is dying!

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.300
How can we fulfill Prince Shang's
and Miss Zhilou's wishes?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.859
This is what you wanted.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.099
We only wish to protect the sanctuary
and the mortal realm

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.379
against the Demons' invasion.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.139
Since everything is set in stone,

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.739
our task at hand now is

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.578
to deliver the Wujing Saintess'
battle robe to Wujing

00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:51.099
to complete the union
with the Wujing Saintess.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.259
However, the groom must
be someone else now.

00:08:55.699 --> 00:08:57.379
There's no use

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.859
in keeping Prince Shang's
dragon pearl.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.340
Please hand it over
to the Dragon King.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:06.259
After millennia
of living up high in the sanctuary,

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:08.019
you're not just cold-hearted.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.499
You're heartless!

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.058
The dragon pearl must stay here.

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:13.779
It must stay here.

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:16.580
If the young master dies
and the world suffers,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.700
Bai Lu and I will deliver it
back to the sanctuary.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.779
No matter how slim the chances,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.060
no one can take it away now.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.540
Fei Yuan!

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.300
Do you want to die?

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:31.739
Leave the dragon pearl here!

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:32.700
Fei Yuan!

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.580
You can keep the dragon pearl.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.298
Since you want
to wait for a miracle,

00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:48.259
you can wait here.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.379
Remember.

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:51.460
Don't forget your duties.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:54.420
The marriage with Wujing
is important.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.219
You two must be there

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.899
to help out.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:11.820
Fei Yuan.

00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.580
The young master
really can't be saved.

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:22.180
No.

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:23.979
There must be a way.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.099
We haven't seen Feng Zhilou
since returning.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.180
She won't take him away for nothing.

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:32.379
If there's any hope at all,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.460
we can't give up.

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:36.779
Fei Yuan,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.099
you're unexpectedly reliable.

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:42.340
The young master has
always been so capable.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.460
It's normal for me

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.060
to be careless.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.300
In the future,

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:53.259
I'll protect you.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.859
Your Majesty,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.339
when we checked on the young master,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.099
it was already too late.

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:04.340
Nothing can be done for him.

00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:10.538
Come,

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.499
my oldest son.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.178
Father.

00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:14.019
You're the Dragons' heir.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.460
If the sanctuary's barrier is broken,

00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:19.339
you must find the Dragon King's Decree
in the mortal realm

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.658
and marry the descendant
of the Wujing Saintess

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:24.700
to restore the barrier

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.739
and save the Dragons and the humans.

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:29.458
I will

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.019
carry out my duty.

00:11:52.059 --> 00:11:55.259
Shang was burdened
with too much since he was born,

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.859
but he has never asked for anything

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.259
other than

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.778
in the marriage
with the Wujing Saintess.

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:02.379
For this,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.979
he defied me for the first time.

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:08.979
That's why I took his dragon pearl out
as punishment.

00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:11.259
But I never gave up on him.

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:13.499
That's because

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.099
I think he's the best choice
for Dragon King.

00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:20.820
Your Majesty, the mistake is done.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.298
We should get ready for what's next.

00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:26.339
Take the Wujing Saintess' battle robe

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.818
to Wujing.

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:31.779
Just tell them the second prince
of the Dragons will be the groom

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:34.298
and welcome the Wujing Saintess
to the sanctuary.

00:12:34.299 --> 00:12:36.619
The throne of the Dragon King
will go to Zhi.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.300
He and the Saintess
will be the new king and queen.

00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:51.058
The barrier is weakening.

00:12:51.059 --> 00:12:52.979
Where have you gone?

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.499
What a rare view.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.540
Father, you care about where I've gone.

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:00.300
I...

00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:08.420
Don't you know your brother's dying?

00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:10.339
Don't you feel guilty?

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.619
Guilty?

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:14.180
Why would I feel guilty?

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.778
Moshang gave up on the throne.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:18.219
He was irresponsible,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.178
foolish and weak.

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:20.700
As for you,

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:23.859
you cruelly took his dragon pearl.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.818
Don't you know

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:27.220
how important it is to a dragon?

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:29.739
You and Moshang caused this.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.940
You don't feel guilty, so why should I?

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:33.538
You wretched brat!

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:35.580
You're cold-hearted!

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.739
Cold-hearted?

00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:42.499
Isn't that good?

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:45.058
A dragon bears a heavy duty.

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:47.700
One should
discard those useless emotions.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.580
Father,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.979
you usually only care about Moshang.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.778
Even if he kept defying you,

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:56.060
you didn't care.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.099
But me?

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.658
I'm always by your side,

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:02.578
yet you never look at me.

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:03.298
How insolent!

00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:04.458
What's with that attitude?

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:06.139
I'm talking to Father. Don't interrupt!

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.220
Listen up.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.859
The important duty of the Dragons

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.019
is now on my shoulders.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.300
Only I

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.899
can become Dragon King.

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:24.820
Only I can

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.739
marry the Wujing Saintess.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.219
Shang has gone through and done a lot.
You don't have the same experience.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.480
You might not be able to do it!

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.300
Father,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.660
do you have any other choice?

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.340
I am the only one left.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.099
You have no choice.

00:14:46.939 --> 00:14:47.700
Yes.

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:49.460
Yes.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.099
All of this was

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.139
caused by me.

00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:58.099
Fix your disgraceful look

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.259
and head to Wujing's War God Hall.

00:15:02.459 --> 00:15:03.658
I, Nie Rongzhi,

00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:05.859
will carry out my duty.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.960
(War God Hall)

00:15:11.939 --> 00:15:13.460
This is Wujing's War God Hall.

00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:15.060
Why are we here?

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.900
(War God Hall)

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.899
You were alone in Feng Manor.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.859
Now, there are many who wait for you.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.940
You're the Wujing Saintess they chose.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.259
Even if someone pretends
to be the Saintess by drinking blood,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.660
they can't be summoned
by the Dragon King's Decree.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.099
The Dragon King's Decree
has already recorded down

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.240
(Dragon King's Decree)
how to verify the true Saintess.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.499
Who are they?

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.139

if this is our final moment,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.139
I don't want to feel any regret

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.700
when I look back to now.

00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:05.979
