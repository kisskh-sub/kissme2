practice with real tea leaves,

the aroma of pine needles

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.020
seeped into that old iron wok.

Thus, the Orchid Snow tea of today

It's a shame

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.280
that this Grand Tea Competition

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.090
is all about raking in cash.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.680
You need to pay

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.070
a 3,000-tael entrance fee
to enter the main gate

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.070
and 5,000 taels for the second gate.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.000
Eight thousand taels of silver

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.120
just to get in once.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.480
So if one wants to win first place,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.280
how much silver would that cost?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.780
And where would

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.440
all this money come from?

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.240
After all these years of war,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.310
the tea farmers are barely surviving.

If the imperial court
truly had a conscience,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.360
it would use this Grand Tea Competition

a way out of their hardship—

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.830

Go back and write it down for me,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.020
so the Sixth Prince will know.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.030
Yes.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.460

venting my frustrations.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.830
I'm just a common man.

My words

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.930
shouldn't be taken seriously.

Who are you?

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.910

What did you do?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.510

by causing a disturbance
in the examination hall.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.900
The Princess Consort sent someone
to serve tea.

The Sixth Prince's wife sent it?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.270
Could it be that the Sixth Prince

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.360
knows I'm here?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.960
That can't be.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.370
We didn't tell him.

heard that His Highness has a female guest

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.840
and sent someone to attend to us.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.510
The Sixth Prince is so imposing.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.320
We shouldn't

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.580

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.160
However, refusing his tea

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.260
wouldn't be proper guest etiquette.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.210
You can't drink it!

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.140

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.870
What's wrong with this tea?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.940
How rude!

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.180
Are we only allowed to drink your tea?

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.480
We've already bragged about

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.110
winning the Grand Tea Competition.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.070
I don't know what happened

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.670
to that friend who helped me.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.130
I need to ask around.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.310
Mr. Gu!

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.440
Mr. Gu,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.570
you have a visitor.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.850
Are you Mr. Gu from Huizhou?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.190
I'm Gu Pingyuan.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.460
May I ask your name?

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.010
Bao Qing.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.270
[Bao Qing, Military Affairs Officer]

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.870
I've heard so much about you.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.880
It's an honor

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.660
to finally meet you today.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.770
So you're Mr. Bao Qing.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.080
I wonder how I

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.420
can be of service to you.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.440
I have a friend

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.110
who's on duty at the imperial court today

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.000
and cannot leave his post.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.510
So he asked me to come in his place

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.720
to invite you to his residence
for a banquet.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.680
Please do us this honor.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.160
[Anhui Governor Qiao Song respectfully
extends an invitation to Mr. Gu Pingyuan]

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.470
[to a banquet at my residence,
feeling both anxious and deeply honored.]

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:17.010
Mr. Bao Qing,

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.160
Governor Qiao—Qiao Song—

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.720
is our provincial governor,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.120
our respected official.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.900
I've never met him before.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.720
I wonder why he's looking for me.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.690
You must go, Mr. Gu.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.070
Please do us this favor.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.830
I'm here at my friend's request.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.090
I had to make this trip.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.320
I pay my respects to you, Mr. Gu.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.830
Mr. Qiao!

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.850
Mr. Gu has arrived.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.430
Gu, let me introduce you.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.730
This is Qiao Song.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.920
Greetings, Governor Qiao.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.510
What are you doing?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.270
Don't be like this.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.470
Please get up. Get up.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.000
Don't be like this.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.560
I can't accept such formality.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.310
Governor Qiao, you're the protector

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.370
of us Anhui people.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:03.830
Kneeling before you

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.690
is only proper.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.080
[Qiao Song, Governor of Anhui]

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.240
That's not how it should be.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.380
From now on, Gu,

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.720
we shall treat each other as brothers.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.870
Please enlighten me, Governor.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.200
Why have you summoned

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200
my brother and me?

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:17.480
Otherwise,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.820
I dare not drink

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.720
or speak freely.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.980
Being kept in the dark,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.360
I'd die with regrets.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.200
Gu,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.590
you were just serving tea
to Her Majesty the Empress Dowager

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.680
at the Sixth Prince's Mansion.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.680
Her Majesty was very pleased.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.980
She told her personal eunuch

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.150
that it's remarkable indeed

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.070
that Anhui has produced
such a tea merchant

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.490
with such insight.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.160
Remarkable.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160
When these words reached me,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.190
how could I not feel ashamed?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.000
Having received such praise
from Her Majesty—

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.590
if I didn't come personally
to express my gratitude,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.620
how could I possibly sleep?

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.160
We couldn't sleep at all.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.920
Mr. Gu,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.680
come on, let me toast you.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.440
Cheers.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.850
Governor Qiao, you seem troubled.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.510
As for the battle at Hefei,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.030
I'm not worried about that.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.360
I'm from the Northwest.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.790
The imperial court ordered me
to train troops

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.240
to quell the rebellion in the Northwest.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.680
The situation there,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.310
though complicated to explain,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.960
can be summed up in one sentence:

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.270
the traitors within conspire,

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.070
and enemies from outside invade.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.700
But even if I train the army

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.070
into elite troops,

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.040
once we reach the Northwest...

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.600
it'll still be useless.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.640
How could it be useless?

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.400
This is no longer

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.070
the age of swords and spears.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.500
Think about it—

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.140
the foreigners' firearms are formidable.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.680
Their guns and cannons
dominate the battlefield.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.640
Their rifles are

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.830
now breech-loading.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.060
They can load five bullets at once,

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.680
each with a range of 500 meters,

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.750
firing once every eight to nine seconds.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.310
And ours?

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.560
Our muskets

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.140
are still muzzle-loaded.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.720
It takes two minutes
just to load one shot,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.610
with a range of only 100 meters.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.640
We'd be killed before we

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.700
even saw the enemy.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.480
Those rebels in the Northwest

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.280
are all using foreign firearms.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.750
I heard from my friends

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.880
who fought there

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.480
that while defending a mountain pass,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.790
our entire battalion of musketeers

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.960
could only watch helplessly as men fell,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.590
unable to advance!

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.000
Since the rebels can buy from foreigners,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.680
why can't the imperial court

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680
do the same?

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.040
We can buy them, certainly.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.590
But how many foreign rifles

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.990
are actually available?

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.830
The Xiang Army wants them,
the Huai Army wants them,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.640
and the imperial court wants them too.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.240
One rifle costs 16 taels of silver,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.110
and it takes seven to eight months
to arrive.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.310
I ordered 300 rifles.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.410
It's been a year,

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.030
and I haven't seen a trace of them.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.680
I don't think this is difficult.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.910
My brother...

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.110
he knows how to do business.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.440
He'll always find a way.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.880
Don't talk nonsense.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.310
Who knows how to do business?

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.110
Don't forget,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.480
up until now,

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.070
we haven't sold a single tael of tea.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.670
Stop talking nonsense here.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.790
Don't worry about the tea.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.270
With Her Majesty's endorsement,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.550
your tea practically

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.920
sells itself.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.830
As for the rifles,

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.270
I was just venting my frustrations.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.200
I've never heard of

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.440
any merchant who can trade in firearms.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.530
Come on,

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.960
Mr. Gu, let's drink.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.280
Cheers, cheers.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.340
Governor Qiao.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.920
If it's convenient for you,

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.780
please provide me with the models

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.270
and written specifications
of the firearms you need.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.070
When I have time,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.070
I'll look into it.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.280
If this path

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.440
can truly be opened,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.770
it would be a good thing.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.960
Sure.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:58.680
Mr. Gu!

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.200
Just hearing you say that

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.550
gives us a little hope!

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.350
Hope.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.920
Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.850
Come on, cheers.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.640
Let's have another round.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.270
I can see

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.920
that you're genuinely

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.720
working for the people of Anhui.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.830
As someone from Anhui, it's my duty

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.030
to share your burden.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.590
Come on, come on.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.110
Cheers.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.550
What's wrong?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.550
You're asking me what's wrong?

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.270
Why did you lock me up

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.350
like a dog?

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.940
You e-even had them

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.880
seal the windows with wooden slats!

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.210
You really want to know?

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.070
Yes.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.270
Fine.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.680
I'll tell the truth,
and you must tell the truth too.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.610
Neither of us can lie to each other.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.040
I won't tell a single lie.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.080
Alright. I'll ask you first.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.410
What were you trying to do
by going out this morning?

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.710
If you want the truth,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200
you must answer truthfully as well.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.590
Gu Pingyuan came.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.680
He brought his tea,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.750
wanting to participate in
the Grand Tea Competition.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.720
I promised to help him

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.380
by using my token to get him in.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.810
But I've failed to fulfill my promise!

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.560
You wanted to help him...

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.510
Alright, you can ask now.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.120
Why didn't you let me go out?

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880
Ms. Su...

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.000
She heard that the Empress Dowager
from the western palace

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.160
would be
at the Sixth Prince's Mansion today

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.890
for the Grand Tea Competition.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.550
Tomorrow, I'll slip in

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.350
by blending in
with your merchants' association.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.200
You don't need to worry about
what happens afterward.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200
I promise you won't be implicated.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.490
You can't promise that.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.590
This is the sort of offense
that dooms an entire family line.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.190
You need to be honest with me.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.750
What is the relationship

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.270
between the Empress Dowager
and the Sixth Prince now?

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.800
Naturally, she regards him as
a trusted aide.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.300
Sister-in-law and brother-in-law
are family.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.330
Isn't it said that the ruler and ministers
govern together?

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.040
You actually believe that?

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.270
There's no such thing as shared rule.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.920
Once she became Empress Dowager,

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.880
she took the Sixth Prince's
favorite daughter

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.270
as her goddaughter
and kept her by her side.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.470
To outsiders, it appears to be an honor.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:27.350
In reality,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:28.310
his daughter is just

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.840
a hostage used as leverage.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.790
Besides, the Sixth Prince

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.350
oversees the Office of General Management.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.400
The Empress Dowager doesn't dare
move against him—

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.930
not because she values him,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.790
but because he uses foreigners
as his backing.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.850
The Empress Dowager is wary of
causing complications.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.950
I heard that the Empress Dowager
is displeased

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.850
with tomorrow's Grand Tea Competition.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.590
She plans to enter through the rear gate

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.590
of the Sixth Prince's Mansion
accompanied only by her personal eunuch.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.720
Ms. Su,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.680
how could outsiders possibly know

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.740
the Empress Dowager's whereabouts?

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.440
I bought this information

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.370
from her personal eunuch himself.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.280
My plan is...

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.440
Ms. Su, stop, stop.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.490
I don't want to hear it. I don't.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.310
I'm begging you.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.790
Alright.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.120
Say no more, say no more.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.880
Ms. Su intended to

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.440
poison her secretly.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.640
She told me

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.550
that everyone
attending the Grand Tea Competition today

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.280
would likely

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.920
not make it out alive.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.570
That's everything.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:30.640
Father,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.400
have you lost your mind?

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.640
You're actually involved in a plot
to kill the Empress Dowager?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.550
Do you know who Ms. Su is?

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.480
No.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.240
You've grown up now.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.480
It's time I told you

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.710
our family's secret.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.750
Have you heard of Lord Gong Deng?

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.110
Yes.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:50.920
The Chief Grand Councillor,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.440
a pillar of the state, was executed

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.100
on the Empress Dowager's orders
for his crimes.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.280
That's right.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.070
Lord Gong

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.960
was the Empress Dowager's sworn enemy,

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.290
which cost him his life.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.200
Ms. Su...

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.720
is Lord Gong's only daughter.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.160
She...

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.410
Our Li family owes everything

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.940
we have today to Lord Gong.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.990
Let me put it this way—

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.930
we were his bookkeepers

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.210
and also his household servants.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.920
Fortunately, that court struggle

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.370
didn't affect us.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.460
Do you understand now?

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.880
But there's one thing
I still don't understand.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.590
Lord Gong Deng is already dead,

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.510
so why does Ms. Su

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.110
still wield such influence?

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.550
A giant

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.120
doesn't fall overnight.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.180
Lord Gong

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.960
served as Chief Grand Councillor

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.270
for his entire career.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.150
His disciples and old friends
are everywhere.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.830
He commanded the southern campaigns,

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.400
and the viceroys and governors
of Jiangnan,

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.400
along with the frontier officials,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.960
were all his loyal followers.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.880
His influence was immense.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.440
Do you think

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.320
we're the only bookkeepers?

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.920
Do you think Ms. Su

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.650
cares that much about us?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.000
She could turn us in

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.800
to the imperial court anytime.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.340
When that happens,

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.180
the label of "rebel remnants"

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.720
would instantly lead to our family's

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.050
complete destruction.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.680
"Li Million"?

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.750
What Li Million?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.940
Even if we had ten million
or a hundred million taels,

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.070
in their eyes,

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.570
we would still be nothing.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.790
I didn't tell you before

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.290
because I was afraid
you couldn't handle it.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.790
Now that you know,

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.420
remember all this, okay?

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.510
I don't know

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.960
when I might die because of this matter.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.280
You could be implicated too.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.550
Or we might have to

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.110
flee for our lives.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:25.990
Therefore, we must be extremely cautious.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.960
That kind of mistake—rashly making

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.620
bold promises out of loyalty—

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.410
must never happen.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.030
I didn't even get a chance
to make that mistake.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.030
I didn't even get to leave the house.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.660
What's the name of the tea
your friend grows?

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.260
Orchid Snow...

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.720
Orchid Snow tea.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.560
The Sixth Prince went to the palace
to apologize.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.200
The Empress Dowager rewarded him
with a jar of Orchid Snow tea

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.680
and told him to savor it.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.710
Your friend has attracted
too much attention.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.310
Pingwen.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.070
Pingwen,

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.060
is that you?

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.310
Ms. Su.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.720
You...

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.750
Gu,

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.140
are you the bane of my existence?

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.570
What have I done?

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.490
Meddling in my affairs—

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.750
are you tired of living,

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.510
huh?

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.680
Why did you try to kill her?

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.680
What's it to you?

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.920
That's Empress Dowager Cixi.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.680
She is my mortal enemy.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.810
Since my father died,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.270
I've been plotting,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.850
carefully calculating every move.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.530
Finally, the opportunity came...

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.080
to avenge him.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.640
But you ruined everything.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.920
Ms. Su,

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.790
please calm down.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.480
I truly didn't know

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.160
what was happening

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.120
earlier today.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.190
Put down the crossbow first.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.120
Let's talk properly.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:14.480
Pingyuan?

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.010
Pingyuan!

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.330
Are you alright?

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.110
Pingyuan!

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.320
Pingyuan?

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.000
Pingyuan, are you alright?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.640
Pingyuan.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.220
Pingwen, you're dead too?

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:31.830
What's wrong with you?

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.790
Are you still half-asleep?

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:33.270
Wait...

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.510
Is this real?

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.690
Am I dreaming?

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.830
You're disoriented from waking up.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.530
Come on, get up now.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.050
No, no!

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.880
Punch me.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.690
Couldn't you be gentler?

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.650
Thank goodness it was just a dream.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.190
You...

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.730
What are you muttering about?

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.980
Kneel down!

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.150
Imperial decree!

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:28.010
[Sanjin Merchants' Hall]

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.350
Imperial decree from the Empress Dowager!

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:50.760
[Sanjin Merchants' Hall]

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.110
The Orchid Snow tea,
presented by farmer Gu Pingyuan

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.679
from Huizhou,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.010
boasts a noble and elegant fragrance.
