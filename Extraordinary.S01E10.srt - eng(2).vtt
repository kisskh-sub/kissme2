00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.920
Not a single dish has come out yet.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:00:59.560
Even the smashed cucumber isn't ready?

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:00.600
Almost done, almost, almost.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.200
Wait a moment.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.959
This salt isn't right.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:12.799
Did that person grow rabbit legs?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.680
Running that fast.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.200
Young Duke.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.200
Throw out all these dishes.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.879
This is poisoned salt.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.799
Poisoned salt.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.200
Young Duke, I didn't know it was poisoned salt.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.159
Who were you talking about just now?

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.239
I saw a woman covering her face.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.519
She ran out from the kitchen.

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:30.879
Couldn't catch up to her.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.560
She must've switched the salt.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.640
That vicious woman.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.120
What should we do now?

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.640
Why are you just standing there?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.799
Go buy it, quickly!

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.719
Alright, alright.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.159
I'll send someone to buy it right now.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.760
Young Duke, I'm back.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.640
Where's the salt?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.799
Young Duke.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.879
I've searched all over the city.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.400
No one will sell us salt.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.719
Even for a high price, they won't sell.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.759
Someone must be jealous.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.800
Deliberately using dirty tricks to mess with us.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.439
Young Duke.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.919
Why is it so hard for us

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.080
to run a business?

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.080
Shuang'er, go back to the mansion.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.120
Bring all the salt here.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.759
Yes.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.439
Ping'an.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.680
Come with me.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.360
What about me?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.879
Guard the house.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.360
Everyone says this place is delicious.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:52.560
Here you go!

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.639
Good food is worth the wait.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.080
Here's a small dish for you.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.719
Enjoy your meal. Alright, alright.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.400
Much appreciated.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.319
Eat and drink well!

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.439
Young Duke.

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.560
Sometimes I really admire you.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.400
How do you come up with these ideas?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.280
Only sometimes?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.000
At least not right now.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.599
As for me, Young Duke,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.960
I'm charming all the time, everywhere.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.919
Careful not to get too close.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.840
I'm afraid my charm might

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.680
accidentally hurt you.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.960
My fate is mine, not heaven's.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.039
Butler.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.879
Why do these dishes have no flavor?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.039
Where's the salt?

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.479
Reporting to the Duke,

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.879
No one in the capital will sell salt to Fan Lou.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.000
Young Duke took all the emergency salt.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.759
With such a big problem,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
why didn't you say so earlier?

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.560
Eat and drink well!

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.919
This way, please. This way, sir.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.199
Shi Feifan, how dare you!

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.039
Guards!

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.719
Tie him up for me!

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.759
Prince.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.319
I don't know what law I've broken.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:27.800
Shi Feifan, you cooked with poisoned salt.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.920
How many lives did you want to ruin?

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.279
What are you talking about?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.839
Our Shi Mansion runs a small business.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.639
We'd never dare use poisoned salt.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.160
Don't listen to his nonsense.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.000
Prince Qing came to arrest people himself.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.000
How could this be fake?

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:45.600
I've heard

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.199
even a small amount of poisoned salt

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.959
can make people vomit and have diarrhea.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.040
Eat too much and it could kill you.

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.480
It kills! Pay us!

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:55.000
Pay! Pay! Pay!

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.639
Pay! Pay! Hurry and pay us!

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.040
Pay! Pay! Pay!

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.839
Pay up, now!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.399
You all look lively and healthy.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.519
Where's the poison?

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:05.800
Slap his face!

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:07.480
Ping'an.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.600
Who do you think you are?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800
How dare you question our Prince!

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.240
I received a report from the people.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:19.879
I can't just stand by.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.360
But acting on your own,

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.639
aren't you afraid of being blamed?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.240
Bustling marketplace.

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.480
Noisy restaurant.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.519
Duke's Mansion suspected of cooking with poisoned salt.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.399
Many people have eaten it.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:34.920
Possible unrest feared.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.639
Duke's Mansion dares to do such a thing.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.079
Summon Shi Mengze to the palace at once.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.120
Yes.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.800
Alright.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.079
Since you say Shi Mansion used poisoned salt,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.040
I must prove my innocence myself.

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:01.519
He's going to eat it himself.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.199
He really dares to eat it.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.439
Prince, anything else to say?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.319
My child's father!

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.319
My child's father!

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:22.639
What's wrong with you?

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.519
Now the evidence is clear.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.519
What do you have to say now?

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:29.000
It hurts so much!

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.839
Prince, are you afraid I'll cure him?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.319
Cure him?

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:40.319
You have that skill?

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.279
Ping'an, bring me scissors.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.040
Yes.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.839
Shuang'er, hold down his legs.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.920
Yes.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.560
What are you going to do?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.240
Bloodletting to detoxify.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.839
Young Duke, scissors.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.319
Hold down his arms.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.720
He opened his eyes! He opened his eyes!

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.319
Is this just a final burst before death?

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:13.920
I think we still need bloodletting to detoxify.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:16.519
Prince! Prince!

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:17.600
Please save me!

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.720
Prince! Prince!

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.240
Save me!

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.519
My money...

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:22.879
My money...

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.399
Prince, my money...

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:26.519
Prince, guards!

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.000
Take this swindling commoner away.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:29.160
Prince! Prince!

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.680
Prince, what money?

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:32.240
Prince, we found it!

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.480
The jar is full of poisoned salt.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.800
We found poisoned salt!

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.160
Prince, you should check carefully.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.879
Is this really poisoned salt?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.040
Yes, it's fine salt.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.240
It's fine salt.

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:49.639
How is that possible?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.639
Prince.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.399
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.600
If you win,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.319
everything in the Duke's Mansion is yours.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.600
If you lose,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.519
write me an apology letter.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.279
Post it on the city gate for a month.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.600
He'll be at my disposal.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.439
Prince, do you dare to bet?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.160
Fine.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.199
I accept your bet.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.639
This is finer than government salt.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.200
It's extremely salty.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.639
Prince Qing, do you want to try it too?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.240
You're lucky this time.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.039
A prince wouldn't go back on his word, right?

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:58.120
Ping'an.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.960
Beat him until you're satisfied.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.600
I...

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:16.559
We'll meet again.

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:21.600
Prince Qing.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:24.159
Don't forget the apology letter.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.519
Young Duke, this salt...

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.679
is even better than government salt.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.240
Please give it a name.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.679
Let's call it Fan Salt.

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:37.759
Salt that everyone can afford and eat.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.039
Fan'er.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.120
Fan'er.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.120
Fan'er, your father is here.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.600
Don't be afraid.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:02.320
Father.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.320
Why are you here?

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:04.240
Steward Liu said

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.720
someone cut off Fan Lou's salt supply.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.720
What's going on?

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:11.799
It's everywhere...

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.879
fine salt.

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:18.919
Where did all this fine salt come from?

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:22.039
The Duke and Young Duke kept pouring it back and forth,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.919
and turned this poisoned salt

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.279
into fine salt.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.080
Strictly speaking,

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:27.759
it's a filtration system.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200
It's future advanced technology.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:29.879
The future...

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.120
Then the shortage of salt in the army

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.679
can be solved.

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:35.600
Of course.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.840
Later on,

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:38.600
I'll have it sent to the army.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.399
Good.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:40.759
Good.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.799
Perfect timing.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.919
You haven't seen Uncle Zhang in a long time.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:47.639
Duke of Nan.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.440
You made it hard for me to find you.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:54.799
Hurry, hurry! His Majesty summons you.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.120
I wonder what His Majesty wants.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:01.960
Duke of Nan, you'll know when you go.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.679
Please.

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:04.440
Eunuch Cao.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.080
I have something interesting here.

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:08.600
I'd like you to take a look.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.080
What is this? I've never seen it before.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.000
This thing...

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.960
It looks even more sparkling in sunlight.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.320
Really?

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.159
Try it.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.559
Let me see.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.159
That's interesting.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.200
I've never seen this before.

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:30.759
Father, don't worry and go ahead.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.440
It's fine.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.039
Eunuch Cao.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:35.320
Eunuch Cao.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:36.960
Please.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.799
Please, please, please.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:41.440
Please.

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:43.440
Eunuch Cao, Father.

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:44.720
Take care.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.559
Alright.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:46.240
Take care.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.120
Shi Feifan.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.279
The Duke's Mansion made illegal salt.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.519
Do you have anything to say?

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.120
Your Majesty, I have nothing to say.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.320
I only offer my son's secret prescription.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:03.879
Your Majesty's benevolence benefits all people.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:06.200
You are truly a great emperor for the ages.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.440
The Duke's Mansion is willing to offer the salt-making method.

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:12.799
to help Your Majesty achieve your grand cause.

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:30.320
Master.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.399
Our men found the princess

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.159
with Shi Feifan.

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:37.480
Not sure if it's His Majesty

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.279
setting a trap with the Duke of Nan.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.799
Princess.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.559
I've loyally served three emperors.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.879
Now I'm suspected by the emperor because of Shi Feifan.

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.840
Then let's kill three birds with one stone.

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:52.840
Eliminate Shi Feifan, this obstacle.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.120
Burn the Shi Family Army's supplies.

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:56.720
If necessary,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.039
kidnap the princess.

00:12:58.559 --> 00:12:59.639
Seize the Tiger Tally.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.840
Secure the throne when the time comes.

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:09.200
Master, you are wise.

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:12.480
Don't worry.

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:16.039
Once Celestial Star Tower clears all obstacles at court,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.559
I will help you rise to the top.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.639
And reach the highest position.

00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:37.240
Not a single bullseye was hit.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.120
If you were on the battlefield,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.639
you'd have died a thousand times.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.600
Focus, everyone.

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.320
Yes.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.600
Practice again.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.799
Uncle Zhang.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:53.399
Uncle Zhang.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.679
Look who's here!

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.759
Uncle Zhang.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.360
Long time no see.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.639
Today you came to see Uncle Zhang

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.679
to raid a bird's nest or catch a big snake?

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:09.679
Uncle Zhang will join you in both.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.399
Second Brother

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.240
Why hasn't Big Brother made a move yet?

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:20.159
So when they come over,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.720
do we kill them or not?

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:22.440
Shut up.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.159
Big Brother sets the granary on fire.

00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:25.480
We act amid the chaos.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.039
Or we wait for the right moment.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.600
Neither.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.039
Today I brought fine salt for the soldiers.

00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:45.960
Where did you get so much fine salt?

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:48.360
If those old officials at court find out,

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.360
the Duke will get another charge against him.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:52.039
I made all this salt myself.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600
You made it?
