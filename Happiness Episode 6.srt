15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,840
(Six months ago)
I saw a sign for half-priced baby goods.

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,240
I bought what I thought would suit
our Wriggly perfectly.

17
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,180
We don't know
if it'll be a boy or a girl.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,850
It'll be a girl that looks like you.

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,120
That's what I say every day
as I pat my tummy.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,450
No girl should ever look like me.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,260
The chairman's here.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
I'm nearly there.

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,260
- See you soon.
- Okay, bye.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Yes?

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,000
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Thanks.

27
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,420
So, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
made the decision?

28
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,290
Yes. It'll be announced before noon tomorrow.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,730
Under the condition, it's prescribed only
to adult ADHD patients.

30
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,260
Once it's proved to be effective,
they will expand the age group.

31
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,330
Good job.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,970
All the Next pills we have in storage.

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,370
I was wondering if I should take them all.

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,840
Thanks to you, I'm about to become richer.

35
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,240
It's a failed pneumonia cure,

36
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,780
but I believe it'll help treat adult ADHD.

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,050
Yes. Word is already getting around...

38
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,750
that it helps you focus.

39
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,220
Lots of people I know are taking it.

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,560
- Is that Next?
- Yes.

41
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
- Have you taken it?
- No.

42
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,000
You should when you don't feel too well.

43
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,870
It makes you feel alive.

44
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,270
It's great.

45
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,380
Hello.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,020
Hello. I'm Park Young In.

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,050
I heard a lot about you. Please, sit.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,220
- Thank you.
- Sit.

49
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,020
- Is this it?
- Brace yourself for it.

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,660
So, are you expecting a prince or a princess?

51
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,400
Our Wriggly? I think it's a girl.

52
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,570
Oh, that's great.

53
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,440
They say that a daughter
is worth ten sons these days.

54
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,100
So they say.

55
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,610
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Sure.

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,850
When will we get to meet your princess?

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,750
I'm 12 weeks along,

58
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,420
so I guess in about six months?

59
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Lovely.

60
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,190
He bites?

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,420
Is he taking something else?

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,090
They'll announce their approval tomorrow.

63
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,030
Have him admitted and silence the staff.

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,330
Word cannot get out.

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,200
He's not dead, so who cares?

66
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,070
Offer compensation and full treatment, then.

67
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,180
I'll call you back.

68
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,560
Honey.

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Sir.

70
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,490
The Prime Minister called.

71
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,570
Where are they headed?

72
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,710
To a landfill.

73
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,110
There's not enough room to house mild cases.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,390
Do you still not get...

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,490
what I'm doing?

76
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,030
I do, sir.

77
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,630
I made a choice.

78
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,100
On how many losses we can stand to take.

79
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,470
The time will come...

80
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,940
when you must decide
how much blood you should shed.

81
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
How about the cure?

82
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,480
We selected a few options...

83
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,310
and administered them to the infected.

84
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,680
They all died.

85
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,920
Try again. Do it until it works.

86
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,590
I'll buy us time.

89
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,780
Then what do we do?

90
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,810
There are infected people outside.

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,150
But we won't be getting any help
from the authorities.

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,820
We have to force our way
out of this apartment complex.

93
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,860
They even installed barricades at every wall.

94
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,060
Even if we force our way out of here,

95
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,590
where are we going to go next?

96
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,530
We can get out of here first...

97
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,730
and get into the most expensive apartment complex.

98
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,130
What are they going to do then?

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Will they seal off that apartment too?

100
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,270
All the rich people probably all live there.

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,140
They can do whatever they want with us...

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,770
because our apartment isn't that expensive.

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,340
Goodness.

104
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,840
Are you sure there are infected people outside?

105
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,650
The resident representative
and Mr. Oh aren't here.

106
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,350
This is about the public rental units again?

107
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,220
All I'm pointing out is that the people
who went outside...

108
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,590
didn't attend this meeting. That's all.

109
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,890
If you want to leave, go ahead.

110
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't guarantee
that you will be able to come back.

111
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,030
Then I'll assume
that we're all on the same page.

112
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,370
We brought some stuff and food from the supermarket.

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,470
We left them in Unit 201.
So if you need anything, go there.

114
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,080
But they will probably need more stuff.

115
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,910
So you can exchange what you have
with what they have.

116
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,590
Hey, what if the infected people
break into the building...

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,550
when their symptoms get worse?

118
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,060
If they crash the door with a car,
the door will break.

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,930
They will probably look
for an easier way to break in.

120
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
That's how crimes all begin.

121
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,530
"I went in because the door was open."

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,700
"There was no lock on the bicycle.
So I took it."

123
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,940
Breaking the door
because they are thirsty for blood...

124
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,910
Getting that kind of determination isn't common.

125
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,210
So we don't have to give them
a reason to break in.

126
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,980
We already locked all the doors.

127
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,260
What is it?

128
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,760
The rooftop.

129
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,340
I'm the only one here.

130
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,820
Do you think they heard us?

131
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,320
Let's hope not.

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,810
You never get startled, Andrew.

133
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,870
You were calm outside and here too.

134
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,210
I'm happy
that people don't treat me like a weirdo.

135
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,920
You two should be careful.

136
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,680
You too, Andrew.

137
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,590
Let's get some fresh air before we head back down.

138
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,570
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

139
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,500
Seriously.

140
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,510
Standing here reminds me of that day.

141
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,210
When?

142
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,850
You mean, that day?

143
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,590
Hey.

144
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,060
Gosh. I really wondered
if I could fly for a split second.

145
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,560
You did fly.

146
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,290
I did.

147
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,200
If I could fly, I would go visit my mom
in the nursing home.

148
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,270
I felt uncomfortable to see her,
so I kept pushing it off.

149
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,270
And look what happened now.

150
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,510
What do you think happened
to those infected people?

151
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,980
Are they hiding somewhere...

152
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,880
and enduring their thirst?

153
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,550
They must be scared...

154
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,860
that they might bite someone closest to them...

155
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,490
and become a complete monster.

156
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,900
But they'll keep fighting
until they cave into their thirst.

157
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,400
Everyone is okay. Right?

158
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,170
Of course.

159
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,140
We have to make sure we don't get hurt.

160
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,070
That way, we can see them again.

161
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,840
Exactly. Don't you ever do something
like that again.

162
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,040
Hey.

163
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,980
Why did you touch that blood?

164
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,880
For all I know, it could've been dangerous.

165
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,950
So you're fine with me rubbing it
on Oh Ju Hyung's face?

166
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,850
You didn't make him lick it.

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,220
I doubt that he'd lick that blood.

168
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,120
Never.

169
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,160
Gosh. It looked like
he really cared a lot about his health.

170
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,900
Seeing how he didn't come to the meeting,

171
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,130
he must feel somewhat intimidated.

172
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,340
And the resident representative
didn't come down either.

173
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Are you all right?

174
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,560
Of course, not.

175
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,130
Look at this.

176
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,830
I must have been really stressed.

177
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,370
Darn it.

178
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,540
Given what happened, perhaps,
it's best to give up.

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,180
Looking at the current situation,
it'll be difficult to make money...

180
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,050
even if you become the representative.

181
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,550
And if we leave?

182
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,220
If we leave, we won't get a penny
for this apartment.

183
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,920
So your plan is to leave this apartment
after losing money...

184
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,790
and start over at a different apartment?

185
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,720
Well, we don't have many options.

186
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,730
You said that Seung Beom might have been infected too.

187
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,590
You went to the gym every day.

188
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,900
What did you do there?

189
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,800
You should've kept an eye on him.

190
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,570
Who knew he would do drugs?

191
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,370
Once the lockdown is over,

192
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
we'll have to repair the entire apartment complex.

193
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,150
We should replace the elevator interior...

194
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,980
and clean the outer walls too.

195
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,550
The lockdown was easier because of the walls.

196
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,420
Let's suggest planting trees around the complex.

197
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,590
You said you knew a landscaper. Right?

198
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,690
And we can even get the entire complex
to be disinfected...

199
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,660
since there are infected people.

200
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,100
Yes. That's it.

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,170
If we just change the way we think,

202
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,140
we have so many ways to make money off this.

203
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,640
By the way, do you think you can be...

204
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,510
the apartment representative?

205
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,490
I should win over some residents
that seem to have sway over people.

206
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,290
My father had schizophrenia.

207
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,830
He passed away two years ago.

208
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,430
So I easily get shocked
when I see people with similar disorders.

209
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,400
Sae Bom isn't home.

210
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,500
Darn it.

211
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,270
Okay.

212
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,310
You're the girl from Unit 502.

213
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,340
Then are you alone at home?

214
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,310
Where are the adults?

215
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,120
Can you open the door?

216
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,780
The adults are here.

217
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,850
You startled me.

218
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
I apologize...

219
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,460
for my action this afternoon.

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,870
By the way,

221
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,970
you should have clearly told me
that you were not infected.

222
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,370
Anyone would get the wrong idea
when they see blood.

223
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,570
Don't you agree?

224
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,280
It must be tough for you too.

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,010
But you are lucky that people are here
to look after you. Right?

226
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,780
I'm so lucky.

227
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,890
I'm so glad that we live on the lower floor.

228
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,760
You must be disappointed...

229
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,260
that you cannot enjoy your honeymoon phase...

230
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,530
because of the disease.

231
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,640
My husband and I started...

232
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,000
from the first floor of a small apartment.

233
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,370
And there was a flood
when we were living on the first floor.

234
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,810
Gosh. Those were such hard days.

235
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,710
How did you two meet?

236
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,350
Gosh.

237
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,430
You guys have a long history.

238
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
You can take a seat there.

239
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
I can't trust that lady.

240
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Same here.

241
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,010
Then why did you invite her in?

242
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,320
Keep your friends close.

243
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,220
But keep your enemies closer.

244
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,320
Hey, what about Sae Bom?

245
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,790
She's talking to Ms. Oh.

246
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,030
She said she came to apologize.

247
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,230
Apologize?

248
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,100
I bet even her apology is annoying.

249
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,230
Yes.

250
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,200
It's because she's not sorry.

251
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,170
By the way,

252
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,270
she asked me
if I wanted to be the apartment representative.

253
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,940
She's eyeing that position then.

254
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,340
That's such a hassle. Why?

255
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,010
She made it sound like it came with a lot of money.

256
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Hey, they make all the decisions
about hiring security guards...

257
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,520
and outsourcing all the services
during the representative meetings.

258
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,750
Elevators, outer wall, roof, garage,
electricity, and landscaping.

259
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,420
All of it. That's all money.

260
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,490
All of it?

261
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,990
Do you have any more?

262
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,490
I'm an athlete you know.

263
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,430
Can you give me another gimbap?

264
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,400
- Gimbap?
- Yes.

265
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Wait.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,910
Are you going to put handcuffs on me again?

267
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,270
I'm losing the circulation in my wrists.

268
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,810
- Kim Seung Beom.
- Yes?

269
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,780
The residents here are on high alert right now.

270
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,980
Up until now, nobody was able to tell,
so they let it go.

271
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,620
But soon enough,
they'll become suspicious of you.

272
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,960
So?

273
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,830
I'm telling you to be careful...

274
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,160
so that people don't get scared.

275
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,500
I can't do anything about the handcuffs tonight.

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,340
But if you're okay for the next few days,

277
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,140
I'll let you roam around in the gym freely.

278
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,810
You're not threatening me today.

279
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,820
I truly hope that you don't have this disease.

280
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,290
Because you're not the only problem...

281
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,690
in this apartment complex.

282
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,170
My gosh!

283
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,000
Darn it!

284
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,570
I'm going to kill them.

285
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,110
Just wait and see.

286
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,600
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm fine.

287
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,000
See? Look. Isn't it clean?

288
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,230
Are you sure you're not scared?

289
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,000
You nearly scraped off your skin
washing your face.

290
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,910
Hey!

291
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,780

(Hangover Medicine)

that's bad for you.

294
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,020
Pour me a drink.

295
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,630
Have you...

296
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,170
ever seen Min Ji take medicine at the hospital?

297
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,370
Like vitamins or supplements.

298
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,310
She took something whenever she was tired.

299
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,770
What kind of medicine?

300
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,640
I don't know. It was a pill.

301
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,950
She said it was a supplement
she got from the gym.

302
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,320
The gym?

303
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,690
Your name wasn't on the access list to the gym.

304
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,690
My wife was the one who went to the gym.

305
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,130
Did the mad person disease
spread from the gym?

306
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,600
Why? Is it important?

307
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Don't drink too much.
You don't want to get sick.

308
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,110
Where are you going?

309
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,340
Somewhere. Don't worry about it.

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,800
I left my wallet.

Why did you bring your wallet?

Hey. Mister.

Yes, well... I guess I am.

323
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,710
The officer on the fifth floor
locked me in here.

325

I'm really clean,

- Did you sell drugs...

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,400
to my wife?

331
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,000
The doctor on the sixth floor,

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,370
the one who died from mad person disease.

333
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,180
I'm not here to blackmail you.

334
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,180
Nor am I here to get revenge.

335
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,950
I'm grateful to you.

336
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Hey, mister.

337
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,290
I want to buy some of that drug.

338
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,360
I really don't know anything about it.

339
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,240
- You don't?
- I really don't.

340
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,610
- You don't know?
- I don't.

341
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,010
- You don't?
- I don't.

342
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,210
My gosh.

343
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,010
You're really annoying me.

344
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,250
Should I kick you out of this place
saying you're sick? You lunatic!

345
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,550
My gosh.

346
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,390
Hold on.

347
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,930
- Hold on.
- You don't know anything.

348
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,100
Why are you doing this?

349
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,830
You don't know anything?

350
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,100
I really don't.

351
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,800
Mister. Hold on.

352
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,670
I don't know anything. Okay?

353
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,710
- Hey, mister.
- What don't you know?

354
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,770
Please.

355
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,580
- Stop. Please stop!
- Get over here.

356
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,180
Yes, are you Attorney Kook Hae Seong?

357
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,690
Yes, I am.

358
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,620
I live in Building 102,

359
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,320
and I'm here
because I saw your ad on the elevator.

360
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,330
I heard there are a lot of patients outside.

361
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,870
It's not true. There were a few,

362
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,130
but we locked them up in the children's library.

363
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,840
Building 101 is being sensitive and limiting entrance.

364
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,370
So are you saying it's not that serious right now?

365
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,010
Right. Can we meet for a second...

366
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,680
and talk?
It's about my grandfather's grave site.

367
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,020
Where are you right now?

368
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,280
Basement Level 1.

369
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,460
Can we meet and talk?

370
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,190
The Internet works down here.

371
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,830
It'll be easier for me
to show you a map too.

372
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,870
Stay right there.
I'll be right down.

373
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,010
Weren't you talking to someone?

374
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,540
I don't know.
It sounded like someone outside.

375
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,680
I'm going to step out for a second.

376
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,780
Where are you going?

377
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,980
I'm feeling stuffy in here.

378
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,420
I'm going to cool off
by taking a walk.

379
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,630
(Working from home)

380
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,300
(Search Visitors)

381
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,030
(We are looking it up.
Please wait a moment.)

382
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,300
Yes, are you Attorney Kook Hae Seong?

383
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,680
What's wrong?

384
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,480
- Hello.
- Hi.

385
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,550
My husband went out to meet someone
from another building.

386
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,090
I remember hearing...

387
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,160
there were a lot of
mad person disease patients outside.

388
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
Excuse me.

389
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,170
Where is he?

390
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,140
No! Help me!

391
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,550
I was hoping he didn't have it.

392
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,160
Hey! Help me!

393
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,860
- Do something about this lunatic!
- Why should I?

394
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,260
The world would be a better place
without you in it.

395
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,210
Hey! Help me!

396
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,830
Hello, sir.

397
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,160
We're all stuck inside,

398
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,930
so I couldn't go out to get a consultation.

399
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,700
Okay. Hold on.

400
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,040
(You're not connected to a network.)

401
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,110
The Internet isn't working.

402
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,010
You have to come out over here.

403
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Over here.

404
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,320
How do I unlock the door?

405
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,670
You're lucky.

406
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,070
If it weren't for Sae Bom,
you'd be dead.

407
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,240
Do you see that camera?

408
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,710
If you tell anyone about this guy,

409
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,880
I'll send everyone a video of him grabbing you.

410
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,350
People will think you're infected.
Do you get what I'm saying?

411
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,120
So...

412
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,060
stay at home and just breathe.

413
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,900
Why...

414
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,970
Why are you hiding the fact...

415
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,370
that he's sick?

416
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Because he's a person.

417
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,680
Mr. Kim.

418
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,240
Calm down.

419
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,280
You can become normal again.

420
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,710
Mister.

421
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,010
The complex is under lockdown.

422
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,980
Go home...

423
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,150
and get some sleep.

424
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,160
Lady.

425
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,560
What was that about? You startled me.

426
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,890
Stay still.

427
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,730
We don't want him to break in.

428
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,720
Mister.

429
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,130
I told you earlier
that you shouldn't go outside.

430
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,460
He was a client!

431
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,900
He wanted to discuss his grandfather's land.

432
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,160
Didn't you see he was just fine?

433
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,670
I just saved you from getting buried.

434
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,040
You just lost me a client.
What are you on about?

435
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,240
Are you jinxing me?

436
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,410
Honey.

437
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,710
Are you all right?

438
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,310
Are you hurt?

439
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,620
- Did you tell her?
- What?

440
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,250
Why did you do that?

441
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,920
Darn it.

442
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,490
You just won't stand down, will you?

443
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,360
I should toss you to him
and get you infected.

444
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,730
- Guess what?
- What?

445
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,970
I am...

446
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,240
incredibly...

447
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,810
lucky, you see.

448
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,750
Take this.

449
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,650
That's disgusting.

450
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,420
There is...

451
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,090
someone outside, okay?

452
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,720
There you are.

453
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,790
Your husband's out of his mind!

454
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,200
Did you touch him?

455
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,900
What is wrong with you people?

456
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,110
Your husband...

457
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,280
hit my face while I was wearing my glasses.

458
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,510
Attempted murder...

459
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,910
No. He tried to kill me.

460
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,410
Come here.

461
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,050
He tried to...

462
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,620
get that monster to kill me.

463
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,150
What's that?

464
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,620
- What is that?
- Are you okay?

465
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,690
Kim Seung Beom's infected.

466
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,100
Hey.

467
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,930
It's dangerous. Stay back.

468
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,520
I will kill you.

469
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,990
I will kill you all.

470
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,310
Did you know we had a patient inside?

471
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,850
Then you should've told us!

472
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,880
The trainer in the basement gym.

473
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,880
I think he's sick.

474
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,730
There's someone down there?

475
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,670
How is he?

476
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,400
Hey...

477
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,700
At around 10:45 or 10:46pm,

478
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,270
he stopped banging his head.

479
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,410
You go upstairs.

480
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,410
I'll check things out.

481
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,880
Be careful.

482
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,620
You're awake, aren't you?

483
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,730
You're awake.

484
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,000
The people upstairs...

485
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,370
will be talking about throwing you out.

486
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,710
Darn it.

487
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,780
I only took the pill twice.

488
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,380
They said it was a good pick-me-up
when you're tired.

489
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,920
Why did you go to your car?

490
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,390
To get the rest of my pills.

491
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,000
I can focus better on them.

492
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,330
You thought of taking a pill
in that situation?

493
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,040
I really only took it twice.

494
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,610
Do you remember what happened
when you turned?

495
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,210
A bit.

496
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,780
The guy from the sixth floor came in
and said something.

497
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,920
I tried to hold back,

498
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,620
but he kept talking.

499
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,060
It would be best
if you hold back from now on.

500
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,530
The more often you turn,

501
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,430
the harder it becomes to come back.

502
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,070
I told that guy about the pills.

503
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,510
That they're in the gym's van.

504
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,480
I'll deal with that.

505
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,350
Was it fun?

506
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,160
Do you enjoy yourself
when you have a fit?

507
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,530
Is it exciting and thrilling?

508
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,700
Is it?

509
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,610
Then you can't hold back for long.

510
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,650
It's cold at night.
Wear something warm.

511
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,120
How's the gym guy?

512
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,130
He's back to normal now.

513
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,400
He turns for about 15 minutes,

514
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,000
then switches back.

515
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,900
We'll vote tomorrow.

516
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,140
- On what?
- Kim Seung Beom.

517
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,440
Whether he should stay or go.

518
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,510
The sixth-floor lawyer said...

519
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,080
we were a democracy,
so we should vote to decide

520
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,950
To be honest, I thought I was nasty.

521
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,950
But here, I have nothing on the other guys.

522
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,590
Didn't the resident representative complain?

523
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,160
All she cares about
is being the apartment representative.

524
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,930
If we side with her,

525
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,930
she'll cancel our management fees.

526
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,500
Jung Guk was right, then.

527
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,670
About...

528
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,570
what Oh Ju Hyung said.

529
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,280
It's a lie, isn't it?

530
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,440
What is?

531
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,010
That I tried to kill him?

532
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,010
That's not true. He...

533
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,250
He was threatening the gym guy,

534
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,990
- so I threatened him back.
- Right?

535
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,120
Yes.

536
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,390
It got to me a bit.

537
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,990
You know how I can't keep things to myself
and stew on them.

538
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,290
I know that.

539
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,690
Sae Bom.

540
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,400
- The good cop, bad cop strategy.
- What's that?

541
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,240
When one plays the bad cop
and gets angry and scares people,

542
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,840
the other uses nice words to persuade them.

543
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,210
Carrot and stick.

544
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,650
- What about it?
- I'll play the bad cop.

545
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,710
You play the good cop.

546
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,520
- No.
- What?

547
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,920
You already played the bad cop an awful lot.
I'll be the bad cop.

548
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,690
I'll beat up anyone I find annoying.

549
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,760
So you have to be nice. Okay?

550
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,630
Be nice.

551
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,030
Hey.

552
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,070
I don't want you to get hurt...

553
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,810
because that's what happens...

554
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,170
to bad cops.

555
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,450
We must release him.
Only then we can survive.

556
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,920
Is he the only one?
Is everyone else okay?

557
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,790
Did anyone get bitten?

558
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,290
We don't know that yet.

559
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,290
But we must release him
once his symptoms show.

560
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Sir.

561
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,760
Can you share this video with me?

562
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,660
You'll agree to releasing him. Right?

563
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,500
Of course. I already saw a bunch
of infected people outside.

564
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,870
- Gosh.
- Hey. I was watching that.

565
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,170
- Why did you take it from me?
- Please vote with me.

566
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,440
Things are getting serious.
You agree, don't you?

567
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,180
This is it.
I was so scared after seeing that.

568
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,980
You understand
why I behaved that way, right?

569
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,710
Is that what's important now?

570
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,180
Hey, look at his eyes.

571
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,650
Where's Mr. Oh Ju Hyung?

572
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,120
He's constantly washing himself.

573
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,630
If you want,

574
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,100
I can let you take an empty room
in my house.

575
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,530
You can stay with us too.

576
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,610
I appreciate you looking out for me.

577
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,190
Do you have to make house calls?

578
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,730
Of course.
Imagine I opened the door earlier.

579
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,960
That guy from the next building
would have killed me off instantly.

580
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,870
He talked about the grave site
and tried to kill me.

581
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,610
What if we get infected too?

582
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,980
Why would we?

583
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,480
We didn't do anything wrong.

584
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,610
You don't get sick
because you do something wrong.

585
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,530
Anyway, I'm not leaving my house
until the lockdown is lifted.

586
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,230
It will only take five minutes.

587
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,000
You can save a man with those five minutes.

588
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,140
Are you sure they are even human?

589
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,310
I'm talking about the infected people.

590
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,780
Of course. You can talk to him
if you go down to the gym.

591
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,280
A man might die because...

592
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,150
you won't leave your house.

593
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,060
Please think about this.

594
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,070
Please think about it.

595
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,410
What are you doing here?

596
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,910
I was waiting for you.

597
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,180
Where did you go?

598
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,780
To the 15th floor. I asked him to come down
for the vote tomorrow.

599
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,740
Have you ever regretted something in your life?

600
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,250
Well...

601
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,580
I have.

602
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,820
When something happens,

603
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,360
but it ends before I get to give it my all,

604
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,660
it leaves me a lot of regrets.

605
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,400
I still remember stuff like that
even after years pass by.

606
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,500
That makes me feel guilty.

607
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,970
So you don't want any regrets this time?

608
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Right.

609
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,840
This time I'll face it head-on.

610
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,620
(Monthly gym membership, 30 dollars)

611
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,420
Bingo.

612
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,530
What?

613
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,880
Let's go.

614
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,550
Okay.

615
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,780
Mom, let me borrow your phone.

616
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Why?

617
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,320
I'll give it back after I take a video.

618
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,820
I lost mine.

619
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,290
Where did you lose your phone?

620
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,360
I thought you had a new phone.

621
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,600
Mom, you don't use it
except for making calls. Right?

622
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,630
What's the passcode?
It's not locked.

623
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Thank you.

624
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,070
Return it right back
once you're done taking photos.

625
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,940
Okay, I will. Goodness.

626
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,040
- Let's go.
- Go.

627
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,610
Thank you all for coming
during your busy days.

628
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,550
Article 22 of our Penal Code states...

629
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,820
a regulation regarding emergency evacuations.

630
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,290
Let me read that for you.

631
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,060
"An act performed to avoid..."

632
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,860
"impending danger against one's own
or other person's legal interest..."

633
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,100
"shall not be punishable
when there are reasonable grounds."

634
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,830
"The provisions of the preceding paragraph
shall not apply..."

635
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,040
"to a person who cannot avoid the danger."

636
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,170
Let me put it in layman's terms.
The law allows us...

637
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,980
to kick him out for the safety of the group.

638
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,580
I doubt that you guys want...

639
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,520
to get infected like the other buildings.
Correct?

640
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,020
Let me play this for you.

641
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,790
It's very scary. Take a look.

642
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
Oh, Lord.

643
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,060
Who here has had COVID-19?

644
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,470
Why are you bringing up COVID-19 now?

645
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,770
No one?

646
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,340
I did catch it once. Why?

647
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,840
Let me ask you something.

648
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,710
Sir, did you catch COVID-19
because you did something wrong?

649
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,880
That's ridiculous!

650
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

651
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,580
I wouldn't have gotten it
if my friends invited me out...

652
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,720
for a meal.

653
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,190
Right. Diseases...

654
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,360
don't pick who gets them or not.

655
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,430
Right.

656
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,990
Do you remember how it was
during the COVID-19 outbreak?

657
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,930
Some people dug up...

658
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,470
personal information of infected people and criticized them.

659
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,740
But other people were worried
about the infected people...

660
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,070
and wished them to recover.

661
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,440
The infected people shouldn't be kicked out
without a chance...

662
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
to get treated.

663
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,150
This is not COVID-19.

664
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
It's different.

665
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,520
They are violent and try to bite other people.

666
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,290
I understand that you are all scared and anxious.
I feel the same way.

667
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,560
But what if this happened to you...

668
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,800
or your family?

669
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,040
Who will we kick out next
after Trainer Kim Seung Beom?

670
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,940
Mr. Oh Ju Hyung from the sixth floor?

671
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,480
Or you since you had contact with Mr. Oh?

672
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,050
Should we play musical chairs...

673
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,120
until there's only one of us left?

674
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,250
Whatever. Let's vote.

675
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,020
Raise your hands if you vote for releasing him.

676
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,060
Look. We don't have to release him.

677
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,400
I just want to isolate him
from other healthy people.

678
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,970
We can put him on the rooftop
and isolate him completely.

679
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,370
That way, it will be safe for all of us.

680
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,710
- Don't you agree?
- Well...

681
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,480
Don't be timid. Just voice your opinions.

682
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,110
Why won't you speak up?

683
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,280
Hurry. Raise your hands.

684
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,210
Raise your hands now.

685
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
Come on.

686
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,750
Go ahead.

687
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,230
Ms. Oh! How could you do this to me?

688
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,400
How? You made me come here!

689
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,500
I was nice to him.
So I guess he feels betrayed.

690
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,810
So eight people voted for it.

691
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,010
So Yoon, what are you doing?
Raise your hand now.

692
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
Hey.

693
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,490
Nine.

694
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,060
Then who is against it?

695
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,130
One, two,

696
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
three,

697
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
four,

698
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,540
five,

699
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,380
six...

700
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Six,

701
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,050
seven,

702
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,350
eight,

703
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
nine.

704
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,430
We're tied. What should we do now?

705
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,330
Should we take another vote?

706
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,080
I don't think we need to.

707
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,560
I vote...

708
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,870
that we don't kick him out.

709
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,140
Ten votes. We're done.

710
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,680
That's good.

711
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,050
I wasn't comfortable with the idea...

712
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,590
of kicking someone in our apartment out.

713
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,730
You know I don't have any personal feelings
towards you, right?

714
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,960
Okay, then.

715
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,100
Let's discuss how we'll keep an eye
on Mr. Kim from now on?

716
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,800
It's too hard for me, my husband,

717
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,900
and Detective Kim Jung Guk
to watch him on our own.

718
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,770
Let's break up into groups of two...

719
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,810
and take turns checking on him.

720
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:56,970
Who wants to start?

721
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,540
Should we be democratic...

722
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:02,980
and vote on it?

723
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,320
We'll go first.

724
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,080
Hurry up and open the barricades!

725
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,210
How frustrating.

726
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,350
Hurry up!

727
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,820
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

728
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,490
- Open it up!
- Open it!

729
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,020
- Let us through!
- Come on!

730
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,590
- Let us through!
- Come on!

731
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,560
How long are you going to keep us here?

732
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,960
We have to get through!

733
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,700
- How long are you going to keep us?
- Let us go through!

734
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,300
I heard you told the prime minister's office...

735
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,440
that the areas with the most infection
must be controlled first.

736
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,540
I told them that
once the number of the infected goes up,

737
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,910
there's nothing we can do to stop it.

738
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,780
Makes sense.

739
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,480
You don't have a cure.

740
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,490
The best you can do is keep them cool...

741
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,930
and stall with some sedatives and sleeping pills.

742
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,230
You don't have much time left, right?

743
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,030
You have about a month.

744
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,730
The same goes for your wife.

745
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,670
Didn't she get infected
around the same time?

746
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,040
I thought
that was why you said you'd come up...

747
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,380
with a cure in a month.

748
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,820
I understand that you're in a hurry.

749
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,500
I'm going to give up...

750
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,300
on the current restricted areas.

751
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,640
You barely supported us until now.

752
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,000
Like you said,

753
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,110
we can't have any more infected people.

754
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,740
Cut the power...

755
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,840
and don't give them food.

756
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,850
The entire nation has their air conditioners on,

757
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,020
so we don't need to waste any more energy.

758
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,320
So you want to cut the power...

759
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,890
and wait for the infected to die on their own?

760
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,630
There will still be problems
even if there is a cure.

761
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,030
Anyone who has had a taste of blood...

762
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,730
can't be forgiven just because it happened
when they were sick.

763
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,130
You're the one...

764
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,840
who's addicted to the taste of blood.

765
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,810
It's okay for me to be.

766
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,910
I'm telling you
so that you know in advance.

767
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,580
Because you seem to have a plan.

768
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,150
Shouldn't we stop him?

769
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,220
If they cut the power,
the water will come next.

770
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,260
Then even those
who aren't infected will end up dying.

771
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,230
Find out when they're planning
on cutting the power.

772
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,700
Hey.

773
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,110
Why do you think I married you?

774
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,750
If you're my secretary, act like one...

775
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,210
and follow my lead without me explaining it.

776
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,880
We're married now.

777
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,050
You and I can have different opinions.

778
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,320
I still don't think that I was wrong.

779
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,560
So will you take responsibility
if we get infected?

780
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,190
This is why I shouldn't have married
someone so uneducated.

781
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:20,600
I think...

782
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,560
I made a mistake.

783
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,280
Dong Hyun.

784
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,510
- Give me my phone.
- Gosh.

785
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,120
Mom. I need to finish filming
to give it back to you.

786
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,950
Why are you nagging me so much today?

787
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,250
Do you have something on this phone?

788
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,360
What would I have on the phone?

789
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,830
Just wait a bit. Okay?

790
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,200
I'm going to go out to see
if there's anything more to film. Okay?

791
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,930
Dong Hyun. Hey.

792
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,300
Mom!

793
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,230
I'll give it back to you soon.

794
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,330
My gosh.

795
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,580
I need something impactful
for my views to go up.

796
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,050
What is this old lady doing?

797
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,750
My gosh.

798
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,160
Excuse me.

799
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,160
Did you lose your phone?

800
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,000
How did you know that?

801
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,700
You dropped it when we came in.
Right out front.

802
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:33,770
So...

803
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,470
How did you know I was looking for it?

804
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,310
You were filming something with it
on our way back yesterday.

805
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,910
You're filming right now as well.

806
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:41,810
I thought you might be looking for it.

807
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,410
Excuse me!

808
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,610
Ms. Lee?

809
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,790
Can you help me?

810
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,290
I'm not going to go outside.

811
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,420
I'll give you money.

812
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,290
Don't you need money?

813
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,560
Let me know if you need anything.

814
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,030
Can I ask you for a gun?

815
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,570
Do you think I'd give you one?

816
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,870
Why are you so interested in military goods?

817
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,740
I'm very interested in the apocalypse.

818
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,250
The Earth is in danger right now.

819
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,920
Even without a contagious disease, unusual weather,

820
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
global warming, nuclear war, artificial intelligence...

821
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,150
The end of the world is nearing.

822
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,820
I see.

823
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,690
That's why...

824
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,630
I'm in the process of collecting survival equipment.

825
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,330
I have combat rations from all over the world too.

826
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,570
Do you have a lot?

827
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,740
Of combat rations.

828
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,910
Do you want to...

829
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,840
take a look at my collection?

830
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,710
You have a collection?

831
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,350
May I?

832
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,810
Can't you break it
if you use a bit of strength?

833
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,810
I'm not sure.

834
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,250
If you break that,
your life will break apart too.

835
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,690
If you don't want to be kicked out,
you should be careful.

836
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,060
Are you here to tease me?

837
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,360
I'm here to clear up our misunderstanding.

838
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,730
I wanted to help you too.

839
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,100
But you're the one who took the drug.

840
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,130
When did you help me?

841
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,870
Drink it when you get thirsty.

842
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,080
Only when you can't bear it anymore.

843
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,510
I came because I was worried.

844
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,650
Why did you agree to come?

845
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,450
- Be quiet.
- What?

846
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,850
Tell me if you need anything.

847
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,480
Sometimes it seems like
you have a mental disorder.

848
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,250
Are you crazy?
How could you say that to your little sister?

849
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,490
I'm telling you that you do.

850
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,920
I can't believe you're really my brother.

851
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,060
Think about it.

852
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,590
I told you to be quiet.

853
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,370
I comforted him as the resident representative.

854
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,300
I thought
the young man would be having a hard time.

855
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,300
Excuse me.

856
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,940
Excuse me.

857
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,850
I voted...

858
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,350
to kick him out earlier.

859
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,590
Do you think he remembers?

860
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,490
There are others he hates even more,
so you'll be fine.

861
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:52,070
The virus doesn't travel through the air,
so don't worry.

862
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,040
Keep an eye on him.

863
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,900
If he shows signs of extreme thirst,

864
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,710
do not give him any water
and come to the fifth floor. Okay?

865
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

866
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,110
This is the key to his handcuffs.

867
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,450
You won't need it,

868
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,550
but just in case.

869
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:17,220
I'll have a word with him.

870
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,290
Okay.

871
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,200
Hey. Aren't you scared?

872
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,500
Why would you vote yes
when you don't live here?

873
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,180
What did you tell Ms. Oh?

874
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,450
Forget about that.

875
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,610
I know something you want to know.

876
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,480
There's a lot I want to know right now.

877
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,320
The buyer.

878
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,560
The guy in the Hazmat suit.

879
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,400
The last voter.

880
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,970
- Exercise increases muscles.
- Yes.

881
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,170
If you take one of these,

882
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,140
you'll get double the result
compared to just working out.

883
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,740
If you look, it's a small pill.

884
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,210
The 15th floor.

885
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,090
It was right there.
I don't see it from here.

886
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:23,060
Hurry over there and get it.
I'll stand guard from here.

887
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,500
Let's move all this.

888
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,910
(Fire Trucks Only)

889
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,660
Hello.

890
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,390
Are you looking for something?

891
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,400
Shall I help you?

892
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,760
Sae Bom. Kim Seung Beom says...

893
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,800
Seo Yoon. Where's Sae Bom?

894
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,870
She went upstairs with the guy
from the 15th floor.

895
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,290
(We can chat if you're bored.)

896
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,650
Gosh. They're so cute.

897
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,990
Hyun Kyung. This is Jae Yeol.

898
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,560
He's such a good pianist.

899
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:09,000
When you write a novel about music,

900
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,230
he could help you out.

901
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,310
Then just lend me the money.

902
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:21,010
Aren't you worried about your wife and kids?

903
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,110
Talk about that when the lockdown's lifted.

904
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,050
I bet they're just fine.
Would they not be?

905
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,110
I'm working.

906
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,480
Let's be frank. If you die in here,

907
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,320
then your apartment becomes mine.

908
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:34,590
I followed you down here to help you out.

909
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,760
That sounds like you'll kill me.

910
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,460
You tried to once before.

911
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,000
You pushed me off a swing
and I ended up with this scar!

912
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,800
This is why I always have bangs!

913
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,170
Were you a great sister to me, then?

914
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,010
I had to retake the SAT
because you gave me hepatitis!

915
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,440
Blame that on your weak immune system!

916
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,780
Do you know how it feels
to have to bow to people your age?

917
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,620
Let's talk outside.

918
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,350
Darn it.

919
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,520
Hey. I'm sorry.

920
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:13,090
I'm not saying
I'm making plans to do something to you.

921
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,730
I think it's unfair, that's all.

922
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,130
What do you think is so unfair?

923
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,500
You went to university,

924
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,270
and when you got married,
you got an inheritance.

925
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,610
I only got tuition for one semester.

926
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,510
I worked and paid the rest.

927
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,050
But I didn't complain.

928
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,680
And now you're coming to me
as if you left me money?

929
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,990
I'm sorry about all that,

930
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,790
but let's not be too harsh.

931
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,100
We're still family.

932
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,070
Family, my foot.

933
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,940
What's that noise?

934
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,850
- We're safe here, aren't we?
- What?

935
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,280
What was that noise anyway?

936
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,050
(Community Center)

937
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,390
It's fine. We're safe here.

938
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,910
Don't... Get over here!

939
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,540
What are you doing?

940
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,540
Go! Run!

941
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:36,710
Run away!

942
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,160
I don't hear anyone.

943
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,540
Don't open the door.

944
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,510
Don't talk like that to me.
I'm your older brother.

945
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,090
Are you scared?

946
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,960
I'm right here. Don't be.

947
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:05,870
Darn it.

948
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,470
Did something happen outside?

949
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,550
Sae Bom.

950
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,490
Sae Bom.

951
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,160
She's in here, isn't she?

952
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:40,070
She's busy right now.

953
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,500
She'll be right out. Wait here.

954
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,170
Did you take the pill...

955
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,710
you bought at the gym?

956
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,920
If you hurt Sae Bom...

957
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,090
I will kill you.

958
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,430
=Happiness=

959
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,620
Someone's missing because of you.

960
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,680
We have the power.

961
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,390
We need people.

962
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,350
Someone who will do as we say.

963
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,060
Water doesn't help with the thirst.

964
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,530
It's Na Soo Min's phone.

965
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,460
They'll cut the power tonight.

966
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,030
Go.

967
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,200
You stay here.

968
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,870
I'm here for Sae Bom.

969
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,900
I'm here for even the smallest possibility.

970
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,040
If need be,

971
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,570
I'll get that person bitten.
