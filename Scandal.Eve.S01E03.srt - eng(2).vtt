WEBVTT

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:24.212
Hey, can you keep it down?

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:31.594
I told you to keep it down.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.847
Hey.

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:50.154
What's wrong?

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:52.365
Nothing.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.484
Furusawa from the Tokyo Assembly

00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:30.904
might have lied
about his educational background.

00:01:30.987 --> 00:01:34.032
He claims to have graduated
from Atlanta University in the US,

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.868
but his former secretary says
he went to a vocational school

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:38.494
with a similar name.

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:40.496
Has the university confirmed that?

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:43.541
They haven't responded to my email yet.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.753
Then scrap it.
It's not worth spending that much time on.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:47.962
What's your last topic?

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.965
Yes, sir. Sakaida,
a famous baseball player,

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.345
is said to be slandering his teammates
on a private social media account.

00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:56.262
Any proof?

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:59.182
I'll go talk
to his former teammate tomorrow.

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:00.350
Keep working on that.

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:02.018
Yes, sir.

00:02:03.186 --> 00:02:05.063
Hirata, you're next.

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:14.530
Hirata, your topics.

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:16.950
I don't have any.

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:20.536
What does that mean?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.497
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:25.708
I don't have any topics
suitable for this meeting.

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:30.588
Sorry for disappointing you.
That's all from me.

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:37.345
-Next.
-Yes, sir.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:42.475
My first topic is an inheritance dispute
over the estate of Ichiro Iida,

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:45.228
a famous businessman,
after his sudden death--

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:51.526
You seemed pretty on edge
in that meeting back there.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:52.443
Yeah?

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:55.238
Yes, it even got me nervous.

00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.657
-Did you really not have any topics?
-Thanks.

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:00.493
For the Fujiwara story,

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:03.538
the source was Mr. Akashi,
general manager of Kodama Productions.

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:05.123
Wait, the agency?

00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:07.083
Have you confirmed that?

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.961
The barkeeper who connected
Moeka Tanabe to Fujiwara

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:12.213
tried to sell
that information to a magazine,

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:16.467
but Kodama Productions found out
and paid a huge sum to buy it.

00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:19.345
But why leak it now after all this time?

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.222
Probably to harass Rafale.

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:25.184
They branched off from Kodama
while taking Fujiwara with them.

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:28.146
So they used us to try to ruin Fujiwara?

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.189
But didn't the editor-in-chief say

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:32.859
it was an anonymous leak
when he assigned it to you?

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:38.489
I think he knew that the source
was Kodama Productions.

00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:40.742
What? What does that mean?

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.745
You know that we make tons of money

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:47.457
from calendars and photobooks
of idols affiliated with Kodama, right?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.253
He was the one who arranged that deal,
and became editor-in-chief as a result.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.799
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's linked to Yoko Kodama.

00:03:56.883 --> 00:04:01.554
So you're saying he published that article
on Kuryu in order to help Kodama?

00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:04.098
But that's favoritism.

00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:07.226
-That's why I'll write an article on it.
-What?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.355
"The article from Weekly Buncho
bashing Fujiwara

00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:14.484
was written in order to please
a big talent agency."

00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:19.655
"The entertainment industry resorts
to dirty tactics to silence a magazine."

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.909
"It's time to shine a light on it all."

00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:25.370
-How does that sound?
-But isn't that…

00:04:25.453 --> 00:04:26.579
Don't do it.

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:29.624
The Fujiwara topic is old news now.

00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:32.960
He ended up getting dropped
from the JBS TV special drama too.

00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:36.089
He's out of the public eye now.
I doubt the readers care anymore.

00:04:36.172 --> 00:04:38.174
I wonder about that.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:41.928
What if Kodama was also behind him
getting dropped from the drama?

00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:43.304
In the first place,

00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:47.600
our editor-in-chief won't allow an article
saying we bowed down to a big agency.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:49.602
It will just harm your career.

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:52.522
Exactly. That would be whistleblowing,
wouldn't it?

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.399
You could get fired.

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:58.236
You once told me, Ninomiya,
that the role of a reporter

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.031
is to be the person
who says the emperor wears no clothes.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.576
You taught me that when I just joined.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.245
Have you forgotten?

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:10.123
Look, recklessness
isn't the same as bravery.

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:12.333
And cowardice isn't the same as caution.

00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:14.585
Calm down, you two.

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.464
Also, why are you so fixated
on this story, Kanade?

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:21.008
Because it's humiliating.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:22.218
What?

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.973
I hate that I was exploited into writing
an article to suck up to an agency.

00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:32.019
Doesn't mean you have to
throw your career away.

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:34.856
Provoking the editor-in-chief
could lose you your transfer

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:35.940
as well as your job.

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.409
I wonder why she has so much hostility
for the entertainment industry.

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:53.457
MEMORIAL FOR SHIGERU KODAMA

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:58.963
It's been lovely having you all here,
but it's about time to wrap up.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.883
I would like to thank you all

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:07.096
for coming to commemorate my father,
Shigeru Kodama.

00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.352
Building this agency
in just one generation took my father…

00:06:14.854 --> 00:06:18.399
took the chairman
no small amount of effort.

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:24.197
I consider it my duty
to take Kodama Productions,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.325
the legacy he left behind,
to even greater heights.

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.623
I hope that all of you will continue
to offer us your gracious goodwill.

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:46.052
The chairman nurtured both his talents
and his employees with love and care.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.933
Unfortunately, his sentiments
were not always answered in kind.

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:58.272
There were employees who left the agency,
as if biting the hand that fed them.

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:02.944
If we were to tolerate
such self-serving behavior,

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:07.573
it would threaten the very order that
our predecessors worked so hard to build.

00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:10.535
Let us stand united

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:14.163
and protect the integrity
of our shared industry!

00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:45.820
TETSUYA IGARASHI

00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:51.367
"For the time being, refrain from casting
any talents affiliated with Rafale."

00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:11.762
I hear Mr. Fujiwara
was officially dropped from the show.

00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:17.602
Why did he end up getting dropped
when the backlash had already died down?

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:19.812
Your other talents
are also getting dropped

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:23.149
from private productions,
one after another.

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:29.405
Is it not because Kodama Productions
is pressuring the industry

00:08:29.488 --> 00:08:30.906
to ostracize Rafale?

00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:36.996
The one who leaked Mr. Fujiwara's scandal
was Mr. Akashi from Kodama.

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.586
I believe you two joined Kodama
around the same time.

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:48.299
Let's make a deal, then.

00:08:49.342 --> 00:08:50.176
A deal?

00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:53.929
A big player in the industry
bullying an underdog,

00:08:54.013 --> 00:08:57.516
and a female head of a company
fearlessly fighting back.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:01.312
The public loves stories like that.

00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:04.482
Having them on your side
would be a big boon.

00:09:04.982 --> 00:09:07.068
If the public makes noise on social media,

00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:09.737
the sponsors and TV stations
can't just ignore it.

00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:12.448
It might make your life a bit easier.

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:14.742
What's in it for you?

00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:18.954
Could you tell me in detail about the feud
between you and Kodama Productions?

00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:20.665
There's no feud between--

00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:24.335
You left Kodama Productions
four years ago, correct?

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:28.130
But I hear you were antagonistic
towards Chief Kodama even before that.

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:29.507
That's pure speculation.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.260
Was the feud caused by the incident
from five years ago?

00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:39.684
I read some magazines from that period.

00:09:41.227 --> 00:09:43.437
Ms. Ioka, please talk to me.

00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:44.689
I refuse.

00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:46.482
Why?

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:49.694
Did you forget what you did to us?

00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:53.489
You tabloid writers
always prey on people's lives.

00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:58.369
I will not dance to your tune.

00:09:58.452 --> 00:09:59.370
Ever.

00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:04.625
Contact me anytime
if you change your mind.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.770
A reporter from Weekly Buncho?

00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:25.855
Yes.

00:10:26.564 --> 00:10:30.234
She found out from the man
who sold us the pictures back then.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.821
Her name is Hirata,
and she came to talk to me.

00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:36.240
Said she knew
we were the source of the leak.

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:40.494
Was it to tear down Saki Ioka,
who left your agency and started her own?

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:43.581
And how did you respond?

00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:46.167
That I couldn't tell her anything.

00:10:48.377 --> 00:10:49.336
I see.

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:52.381
I was too careless.

00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:54.008
I apologize.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.010
It won't happen again.

00:10:57.094 --> 00:10:58.471
You understand, right?

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.099
You know what you must do now.

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:12.193
Be quick and sort that matter out
with the other party.

00:11:14.778 --> 00:11:15.654
Understood.

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:17.990
Please excuse me.

00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:42.223
BUNCHO
KANADE HIRATA

00:11:59.323 --> 00:12:01.325
By the way, I'm done with the draft.

00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:03.244
Okay, I'll go through it later.

00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:06.872
Mr. Ninomiya!

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:12.753
We need to talk.

00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:19.093
Let's go somewhere else.

00:12:28.477 --> 00:12:29.895
You were right.

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:33.983
Aside from JBS TV, other stations
are also trying to cut off Rafale.

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:35.234
I figured.

00:12:35.943 --> 00:12:40.573
Can you dig deeper to find out
how exactly Kodama took action?

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:42.908
Okay, I'll let you know
if I have any updates.

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:44.201
Please do.

00:12:45.744 --> 00:12:47.246
Ms. Hirata, I presume?

00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:51.834
Do you have a moment?

00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:03.470
Here's your fugu sashimi.

00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:05.222
Thank you.

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:12.771
So? What would you like to know?

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.739
You have things you want
to ask me, correct?

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:25.909
It's about Kuryu Fujiwara's scandal.

00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:30.205
The leak was made
by an employee from your agency.

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:33.751
Surely you're joking.

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:36.170
I highly doubt that.

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:37.713
Did you order him to?

00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:40.591
And why would I?

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:45.346
I hear Chairman Kodama was quite fond
of Rafale's chief, Ms. Ioka.

00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:46.597
And four years ago,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.476
when you became the chief,
she left the agency, along with Fujiwara.

00:13:53.562 --> 00:13:58.108
I'm sure you had reservations about
the chairman agreeing to Fujiwara

00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:00.444
and Aso co-starring in the JBS drama.

00:14:02.821 --> 00:14:04.490
What are you implying?

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:08.744
You wanted to punish Ms. Ioka
for going independent,

00:14:08.827 --> 00:14:10.788
so you leaked Kuryu Fujiwara's scandal.

00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:11.955
Am I wrong?

00:14:16.543 --> 00:14:18.379
What an amusing story.

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:21.674
Shall I introduce you to an editor I know?

00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:29.848
It's true that the chairman
had a soft spot for Saki,

00:14:29.932 --> 00:14:32.059
and that an employee leaving the agency

00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:35.062
while taking one of our talents
was a big blow to us.

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:35.980
Then--

00:14:36.063 --> 00:14:39.191
But while Ioka was at our agency,

00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:42.945
she was a valuable employee
who did a truly tremendous job.

00:14:43.904 --> 00:14:47.700
Your accusations
are completely groundless.

00:14:49.034 --> 00:14:52.496
Then, the leak was made
at the sole discretion of that employee?

00:14:53.956 --> 00:14:58.877
If it were true that he really leaked it,
then I would say so.

00:15:00.504 --> 00:15:01.422
I see.

00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:11.640
In that case,
may I ask you about Yuri Hara?

00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:14.476
Do you remember her?

00:15:15.602 --> 00:15:19.690
She was an actress who Ms. Ioka
was in charge of when she was with you,

00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:22.443
and she took her own life five years ago.

00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:26.488
Ms. Ioka went independent
one year after that.

00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:28.866
Was that a coincidence?

00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:36.790
You're quite talented, Ms. Kanade Hirata.

00:15:37.499 --> 00:15:41.295
Just as I would expect from a graduate
of the Kyushu U. Literary Department.

00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:47.551
After graduating, you applied to Buncho
to become an editor of literary novels,

00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:51.305
but you were assigned as a reporter
for their weekly magazine.

00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:55.476
In spite of that, you held strong,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.229
and you have continued
to prove yourself in the field.

00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:05.069
Your parents must be so proud of you.

00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:10.657
Your sister, however,
seems to be an exception.

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:12.826
Well.

00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:18.207
Please, help yourself.

00:16:20.084 --> 00:16:22.544
No need to be so reserved.

00:16:22.628 --> 00:16:25.214
Or do you perhaps not enjoy fugu?

00:16:26.215 --> 00:16:28.884
No, I quite like it.

00:16:30.094 --> 00:16:31.303
Then here--

00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:38.477
I'm not fond of accepting offers
that I might regret taking later.

00:16:40.562 --> 00:16:42.064
If you'll excuse me.

00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:18.725
Ioka.

00:17:21.353 --> 00:17:22.729
Been a while, huh?

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.524
Yeah.

00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:29.486
We used to drink until morning here.

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:33.282
You were the only coworker
I could vent my frustrations to.

00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:35.325
So, what's up?

00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:39.913
I want a bottle of this
and two glasses on the rocks.

00:17:39.997 --> 00:17:41.165
Coming right up.

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:45.043
You okay with that?
Out of nostalgia?

00:17:46.128 --> 00:17:46.962
Sure.

00:17:51.425 --> 00:17:54.178
This is all we ever drank back then.

00:17:55.888 --> 00:17:57.931
Yeah, because it was cheap.

00:17:59.141 --> 00:18:03.103
When you get to our age,
you get to drink good liquor more often.

00:18:03.187 --> 00:18:05.105
And just eat out more often.

00:18:06.398 --> 00:18:07.482
But you know…

00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:13.739
every once in a while,
I get an intense craving for this stuff

00:18:13.822 --> 00:18:17.242
that we used to gulp down
while venting our frustrations away.

00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:24.124
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:35.677
What do you want this late?

00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:39.473
You were staking out Kodama Productions.

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:42.392
Who told you that?

00:18:44.144 --> 00:18:45.729
Was it Yoko Kodama?

00:18:51.944 --> 00:18:54.571
I figured you two were connected.

00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:55.739
So?

00:18:55.822 --> 00:18:58.533
Did she order you
to silence the annoying reporter?

00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:01.954
What are you digging for?

00:19:09.503 --> 00:19:12.798
It was Kodama Productions
who leaked the Fujiwara story to us.

00:19:12.881 --> 00:19:16.927
They wanted to punish Rafale
for branching off and taking Fujiwara.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.305
We published the scandal on Fujiwara
to please Kodama.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.142
If that's true,
I want to make it into an article.

00:19:24.935 --> 00:19:25.894
It's speculation.

00:19:25.978 --> 00:19:27.354
Are you afraid?

00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:30.732
That they'll revoke our benefits
if we criticize them?

00:19:34.611 --> 00:19:39.241
In the first place, we can't publish
that kind of article anyway.

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:40.659
And why is that?

00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:43.912
Weekly Buncho has fiercely exposed
other people's wrongdoings,

00:19:43.996 --> 00:19:46.248
so shouldn't we be
just as strict on ourselves?

00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:48.333
Those are two different matters.

00:19:49.668 --> 00:19:51.670
Fine, I'll publish it somewhere else.

00:19:51.753 --> 00:19:54.006
Do you really think you'll be able to?

00:19:54.089 --> 00:19:56.091
Who's going to stop me?

00:19:56.174 --> 00:19:57.718
Yoko Kodama?

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:08.478
Are you obeying Yoko Kodama
despite knowing the full story?

00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:10.522
Why?

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:12.941
Does she have some dirt on you?

00:20:22.576 --> 00:20:24.536
Why are you so invested in this story?

00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:29.041
I'm not.

00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:32.753
I just don't like
being taken advantage of.

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:38.967
-I will--
-Stay off this case.

00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:41.178
I refuse.

00:20:42.637 --> 00:20:45.098
If you want to keep working
at this company,

00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:48.268
you will stop pursuing this case.

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:50.395
Okay?

00:21:10.665 --> 00:21:11.958
Remember that?

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:15.379
When Aso got double-booked for work
in both Sendai and Fukuoka,

00:21:15.462 --> 00:21:17.964
and we only found out on that morning?

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:20.175
-I really freaked out.
-Right?

00:21:20.258 --> 00:21:23.095
Thanks again for helping with that one.

00:21:23.178 --> 00:21:26.723
It's fine. You helped me
on plenty of occasions too.

00:21:27.682 --> 00:21:32.270
I went through a lot over there,
but I always trusted you and the chairman.

00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:47.953
A Weekly Buncho reporter visited me.

00:21:51.456 --> 00:21:54.501
Said you were the one
who leaked the Fujiwara story.

00:21:57.295 --> 00:21:58.296
Did you?

00:22:05.929 --> 00:22:06.763
I'm sorry.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.518
I was jealous.

00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:16.231
You started your own agency
and carved out your own path.

00:22:19.401 --> 00:22:23.363
When I first heard you were leaving,
I honestly didn't think you'd make it.

00:22:24.197 --> 00:22:25.073
Awful, right?

00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:29.286
And yet…

00:22:30.662 --> 00:22:33.081
you slowly but surely earned repute…

00:22:34.499 --> 00:22:37.294
and Fujiwara managed to return to TV.

00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:42.299
Meanwhile, I'm still just a lapdog
for my agency.

00:22:43.175 --> 00:22:47.470
I'm the "general manager,"
but all I do is follow the chief's orders.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.768
I just felt so pathetic.

00:22:56.605 --> 00:22:57.606
That's why…

00:22:59.816 --> 00:23:01.693
I wanted to get in your way.

00:23:03.111 --> 00:23:04.237
So I did all that.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.413
Did you really do it of your own will?

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:18.960
Yeah.

00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:22.130
It was all my decision.

00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:25.008
I'm sorry.

00:23:37.145 --> 00:23:38.939
You're not pathetic.

00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:43.068
After going independent,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.738
I learned how impressive it is
to stay with an organization.

00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:50.283
So I can understand
how tough your position is.

00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:54.621
I also get that sometimes

00:23:54.704 --> 00:23:58.416
you have to make uncomfortable decisions
to protect an organization.

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:04.005
Not to mention, you have a family.

00:24:06.174 --> 00:24:08.718
You have to look after
your wife and children.

00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:14.015
I'm sorry.

00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:25.986
I should get going.

00:24:28.154 --> 00:24:29.197
Okay.

00:24:31.574 --> 00:24:33.076
Thanks for coming.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.494
Yeah.

00:24:41.459 --> 00:24:43.628
Can I get the bill?

00:24:43.712 --> 00:24:46.589
Yes, sir. Please wait a moment.

00:24:57.309 --> 00:25:00.353
Weekly Buncho acts like
they're some force of justice

00:25:00.437 --> 00:25:01.896
or whatever to the public,

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.690
but they're just cowards.

00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:04.858
Kanade.

00:25:05.525 --> 00:25:07.193
-Can I have more of this?
-Sure.

00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:09.487
You're drinking too much. Are you okay?

00:25:09.571 --> 00:25:11.156
No, I'm not okay.

00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:15.410
If weekly magazines
can only survive by bowing down

00:25:15.493 --> 00:25:20.540
to the shitty entertainment industry,
then they're already done for.

00:25:22.292 --> 00:25:24.169
I've been wanting to ask,

00:25:24.252 --> 00:25:26.546
what's with your bias
against show business?

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.799
You seem to hate it a bit too much.

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:32.802
I can sense it in your articles, too.

00:25:33.386 --> 00:25:37.182
It feels almost like
it's bordering on obsession.

00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:39.392
Is there a reason?

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.231
Sorry, no need to answer
if you don't want to.

00:25:49.402 --> 00:25:51.696
Show business destroyed something of mine.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.782
What? Destroyed what?

00:25:53.865 --> 00:25:55.784
-Here you go, ma'am.
-Thanks.

00:25:55.867 --> 00:25:57.786
-What about you?
-I'll have more too.

00:25:57.869 --> 00:25:59.329
Okay, coming right up.

00:26:01.081 --> 00:26:03.249
Also, did you hear about Mr. Ninomiya?

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:04.751
You didn't hear the talk

00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:07.670
about the young woman
who barged into our office?

00:26:07.754 --> 00:26:09.756
-Not really.
-Guess what?

00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:12.300
I saw the two of them together today.

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:16.596
Looked like it might be
some kind of romantic trouble to me.

00:26:30.276 --> 00:26:31.403
I drank too much.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.988
-You feeling okay?
-Just drunk.

00:26:35.073 --> 00:26:37.075
Sorry, Mizuguchi. I'm going home first.

00:26:37.158 --> 00:26:38.076
Okay, thanks.

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:39.035
See you later.

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:40.453
Is your home that way?

00:27:11.818 --> 00:27:14.237
-You never said you'd come over…
-Can't I?

00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:16.489
-No, you can--
-I'm coming in.

00:27:17.115 --> 00:27:18.616
-Pardon me.
-Hey!

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:23.746
What's up with you?

00:27:36.718 --> 00:27:38.052
Are you cheating on me?

00:27:38.136 --> 00:27:38.970
What?

00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:42.640
Heard you were with a woman
who came to the office today.

00:27:42.724 --> 00:27:43.850
How do you know her?

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:46.352
Just someone I interviewed once.

00:27:47.228 --> 00:27:48.771
For what story?

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:51.065
Can't say. You should know that.

00:27:52.066 --> 00:27:55.320
A person you once interviewed
came to the office over and over?

00:27:55.403 --> 00:27:57.030
It's not that unusual.

00:27:58.364 --> 00:28:00.283
You've got the wrong idea.

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:02.035
Cheer up, okay?

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.247
Okay?

00:29:06.432 --> 00:29:08.476
WILL

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:06.075
-Are you going to shower?
-Huh? Okay.

00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:26.054
R
PLEASE CALL ME

00:30:29.724 --> 00:30:32.685
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
PLEASE CALL ME

00:30:32.769 --> 00:30:36.481
PLEASE ANSWER MY CALLS
I'M AT THE BUNCHO OFFICE

00:30:42.695 --> 00:30:44.739
I NEED AN EXPLANATION FOR YESTERDAY

00:30:45.823 --> 00:30:47.575
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER
UNDERSTOOD

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:49.702
PLEASE GO THROUGH THIS DRAFT

00:31:04.008 --> 00:31:10.556
BUNCHO OFFICE

00:31:15.645 --> 00:31:18.022
I used to be more gung-ho
when I was younger,

00:31:18.106 --> 00:31:19.440
but now I'm more relaxed.

00:31:19.524 --> 00:31:24.153
Rather than do things my own way,
I try to adjust to how my co-stars act.

00:31:24.237 --> 00:31:26.823
That's what's fun for me now.

00:31:27.907 --> 00:31:28.992
I see.

00:31:29.784 --> 00:31:34.539
There are rumors that you'll be starring
in a major US-Japan joint production

00:31:34.622 --> 00:31:36.791
that will be streamed worldwide.

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:41.838
It has always been our chief's desire
for one of Kodama Productions' actors

00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:43.881
to star in a foreign production.

00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:47.719
I would like to take the first step
as the face of the agency.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.685
How did that go?

00:31:57.687 --> 00:31:58.688
Fine.

00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:01.024
I have her location.

00:32:01.983 --> 00:32:03.735
I'll go meet her later.

00:32:03.818 --> 00:32:05.236
This is a critical phase.

00:32:05.903 --> 00:32:07.739
Failure is not an option.

00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:13.119
-Yes, ma'am.
-Do you have any personal goals?

00:32:13.202 --> 00:32:14.579
Let's see.

00:32:15.913 --> 00:32:17.540
The same as my chief.

00:32:18.166 --> 00:32:20.668
I want to leave a mark
in a foreign production

00:32:20.752 --> 00:32:24.047
and repay the chief
and my agency for their efforts.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.508
That has been my goal for many years now.

00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:31.846
Thank you for the call.

00:32:32.513 --> 00:32:35.683
Are you willing to continue
our conversation from before?

00:32:36.642 --> 00:32:37.477
Yes.

00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:40.855
But I have a condition.

00:32:40.938 --> 00:32:41.814
A condition?

00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:45.985
Mr. Akashi may have been the one
to leak Kuryu's scandal to Weekly Buncho,

00:32:46.069 --> 00:32:49.447
but the order must have come
from his superior, Ms. Yoko Kodama.

00:32:50.114 --> 00:32:52.366
I want you to find evidence to prove that.

00:32:54.118 --> 00:32:55.453
I understand.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.208
So the persecution against your agency

00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:05.213
is indeed a concentrated effort
orchestrated by Ms. Yoko Kodama then?

00:33:06.255 --> 00:33:07.423
I believe so.

00:33:08.257 --> 00:33:11.052
However, one thing doesn't make sense.

00:33:12.595 --> 00:33:13.763
Doesn't make sense?

00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:17.600
It's true that there were
disagreements between us.

00:33:18.601 --> 00:33:23.022
I can understand her trying to squash me
by leaking Fujiwara's scandal.

00:33:24.357 --> 00:33:27.360
What I don't get is,
why exactly this timing?

00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:32.532
Filming had already started
for the JBS drama

00:33:32.615 --> 00:33:35.159
that Fujiwara and Mr. Aso
were going to co-star in.

00:33:35.243 --> 00:33:37.912
Even though we bypassed Ms. Yoko
to get it approved,

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:41.666
a scandal on Fujiwara
coming out at that time

00:33:41.749 --> 00:33:45.920
would also greatly affect the work
of Mr. Aso, the face of their agency.

00:33:46.003 --> 00:33:48.923
I can't imagine
any agency would want to do that.

00:33:49.757 --> 00:33:50.716
Good point.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.430
Maybe there was a reason
they had to leak it at that point in time.

00:33:58.933 --> 00:34:04.689
Perhaps something that was more important
than just making things harder for me.

00:34:05.857 --> 00:34:07.525
I want you to find that out.

00:34:14.907 --> 00:34:16.784
Does that ring a bell?

00:34:18.744 --> 00:34:22.540
One of our reporters
got word of a particular scandal.

00:34:23.124 --> 00:34:23.958
What?

00:34:26.711 --> 00:34:29.046
Hey, what the heck? That's mine!

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.091
Is this informant
the person you met today?

00:34:33.551 --> 00:34:34.552
Yeah.

00:34:34.635 --> 00:34:37.138
That's a huge scoop!
When is it coming out?

00:34:38.014 --> 00:34:39.515
It isn't.

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.433
What?

00:34:41.642 --> 00:34:43.352
It ended up being fake.

00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:44.437
Fake?

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.198
That reporter said it was a fake story.

00:34:55.823 --> 00:34:58.201
But assuming that it was true

00:34:58.284 --> 00:35:01.245
and that it was planned
to be published in Weekly Buncho,

00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:05.291
I would expect Kodama Productions
to make a deal with Buncho over it.

00:35:05.374 --> 00:35:09.253
You think Fujiwara's scandal
was used as part of that deal?

00:35:09.337 --> 00:35:13.716
Yes. If that were the case,
it would all make sense.

00:35:16.052 --> 00:35:17.762
What was that article about?

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:23.768
An allegation about a prominent actor
affiliated with Kodama Productions…

00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:27.939
sexually assaulting someone.

00:35:31.067 --> 00:35:32.235
A prominent actor?

00:35:40.576 --> 00:35:44.163
THAT DAY, I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
BY HIDETO ASO

00:35:44.247 --> 00:35:45.665
It's Hideto Aso.

00:36:25.496 --> 00:36:28.499
-Sorry. Thanks for the drink.
-I'll see you again.

00:36:34.422 --> 00:36:36.090
Nice to meet you.

00:36:36.173 --> 00:36:37.883
Did you just get off from work?

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:41.053
Here.

00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:45.391
What?

00:36:45.975 --> 00:36:47.059
TAKAYUKI AKASHI

00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:54.066
I would like to talk to you
about our talent, Mr. Hideto Aso.

00:37:26.015 --> 00:37:29.185
Let us both
make the best of this partnership.

00:37:29.268 --> 00:37:30.353
Agreed.

00:37:31.312 --> 00:37:32.521
PREVIEW

00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:33.606
Is it true?

00:37:33.689 --> 00:37:37.193
Fujiwara's scandal was leaked
to cover that up?

00:37:37.276 --> 00:37:39.320
A SCANDAL HIDDEN BEHIND A SCANDAL

00:37:39.403 --> 00:37:40.905
Are you going to expose it?

00:37:40.988 --> 00:37:44.658
If we don't do anything about it,
our agency is done for.

00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:47.453
COVER-UPS AND TRUTHS
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

00:37:47.536 --> 00:37:49.330
How much has she found out?

00:37:49.413 --> 00:37:50.581
Were you bribed?

00:37:51.123 --> 00:37:54.502
Doesn't everyone have some hidden secret?

00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:57.922
A different side of you
that you can't show to others?

00:37:58.005 --> 00:38:00.132
We can't afford any mistakes.

00:38:00.758 --> 00:38:02.760
Can you agree to a settlement?

00:38:02.843 --> 00:38:06.180
We'd prefer to avoid
taking any forceful measures.

00:38:06.263 --> 00:38:08.641
WHAT BIG SECRET WILL COME TO LIGHT?

00:38:08.724 --> 00:38:11.352
I have nothing to say to her.

00:38:11.435 --> 00:38:12.937
They'll keep pressuring us.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.230
You should stop too.

00:38:14.313 --> 00:38:17.691
This case is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:38:17.775 --> 00:38:20.486
I have something I want you to see.

00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:23.322
Complaints raised by those
who've been unjustly hurt

00:38:23.406 --> 00:38:25.908
are being erased
by favoritism and manipulation.

00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:28.994
THE TRUTH CHANGES INSTANTLY

00:38:29.078 --> 00:38:30.788
I'm considering backing out.

00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:35.751
IOKA ATTEMPTS TO BRING COVERED-UP TRUTHS
TO LIGHT

00:38:35.835 --> 00:38:40.089
WHO IS THE VICTIM OF THE CASE
THEY DISCOVER?

00:38:41.215 --> 00:38:45.428
