Zhi'er

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.240
Take a few workers with you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.600
Sort these raw materials well

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:04.400
Then wash them

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:05.959
Ping'an

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.840
Add more firewood to the stove,
make the fire stronger

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.920
Got it, Young Duke

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.359
Fan'er

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.959
At such a critical moment

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.120
you're still playing here?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.319
Dad, I'm making a mold

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.439
A mold

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:23.159
Anyway, it's serious work

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.680
As for the result

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:26.920
you'll know soon

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.400
Then let me help out

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.200
Dad

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.239
You rest, don't tire yourself

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:35.239
It's fine, it's fine

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:52.920
What are you looking at? Get to work

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.719
Is your lower belly hurting?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.120
Let's go

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.319
Go back and eat Yufu Lao

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:16.960
Yes

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.080
This Young Duke is truly impressive

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.080
Absolutely

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.159
This vessel is bright and colorful

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.479
Its shine reflects like a mirror

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.120
Is this really made from those sands?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.120
Exactly

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.120
It also has a beautiful name

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.319
It's called Liuli

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.000
Liuli

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.000
Listen

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.199
It sounds like gold and jade ringing

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.639
Wonderful

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.639
It's simply dazzling

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:54.800
Shining brilliantly

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.400
And also

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.400
each Liuli piece

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.240
is truly one of a kind

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.960
Duke

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.240
Zhi'er, are you alright?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.840
Get through these days and you'll be fine

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.000
Go help out

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.280
Young Duke

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:12.960
If we sell these

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.240
we'll make a fortune

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.639
Of course

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.800
Naturally

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:20.840
Young Duke

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.599
Already prepared for your friend

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.599
Thank you, Young Duke

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.879
Dad

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.560
Try this

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.120
Look from the small end to the big end

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.560
Can't see anything clearly

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.639
Here, try again

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.439
It's crystal clear

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.400
What is this?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.759
I made it casually

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.919
It's called a telescope

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.199
With it

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.719
you can see things ten li away

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.639
If used on the battlefield

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.680
a general with a telescope

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.400
finds a vantage point

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.360
sees enemy positions clearly

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.319
and makes the right strategy

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.319
Wouldn't we win every war?

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.040
It's a magical item

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.199
It's for you, Dad

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.560
That's great

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.199
Zhi'er

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.759
Zhi'er

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.360
Why are you running?

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.079
Why are you chasing?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.639
Here, take this

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.040
Hold it

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:00.519
Warm your belly with it

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.800
Well

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.360
Don't touch cold water

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.000
Drink more brown sugar water

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.399
And take a day off

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:18.000
Go on, go on

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.000
Young Duke

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.879
Young Duke

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.360
That thing Zhi'er has

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.199
I want one too

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.000
You don't need it

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.199
Why wouldn't I need it?

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.879
I can drink water

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.720
Drink wine

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:40.439
Water flowers

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.399
And also

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.319
give it to friends

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.720
No, Young Duke

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:49.920
I'm serious

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.560
Imperial Brother

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.120
Imperial Sister-in-law, you're here too

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:05.839
Zhi'er

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.040
Fan'er didn't give you any trouble, did he?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.240
Guess what

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.360
Zhi'er brought something for you two

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.680
Zhi'er

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.639
What is this?

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.040
Imperial Brother

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.800
This is called hot pot

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.800
It's popular among the people now

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:32.279
Everyone praises it highly

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.680
Really?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.120
Then I must try it

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.879
How is it?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.480
Tastes good

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.959
Empress, you try it too

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.279
It really tastes good

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.800
But such a big pot

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.120
isn't very refined

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.399
Empress

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.800
Rare to hear you criticize your nephew

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.120
Fan'er invented this dish

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:14.240
Playing dumb while knowing the truth

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.000
Your Majesty is wise

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:21.680
Zhi'er sees the deep love between you two

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.600
I'm already full

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:34.439
Zhi'er

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.240
What is this?

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.040
This is called Liuli

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.040
It's a new product made by Shi Feifan

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.759
Let me see

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:55.680
Your Majesty

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.720
Want to fill the national treasury?

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:05.920
Don't rush.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:07.439
So beautiful.

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:08.240
This is yours.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.160
Take care, come again next time.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.279
This is yours.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.040
Come often.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:16.480
Please wait a moment.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.399
This is yours.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:19.240
Take care.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.759
Thank you.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:20.519
Please wait a moment.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.000
Here.

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:24.199
Come again next time, it's lovely.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:24.839
Okay.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.439
Ping'an.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.879
Why did you bring so many people this time?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.240
That's another big expense.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:33.240
This time, really not.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.360
If you don't believe me, ask the Young Duke.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.360
Yes.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.360
There's really no trick this time.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.639
It's all natural traffic.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:47.799
Please, please.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.559
Please.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.039
To the left.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.159
To the left, to the left.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:53.159
Too far, too far.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.360
Move back a bit, move back.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.120
Okay.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.000
Alright, alright.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.720
Right at this spot.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.080
Right at this spot.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.480
Father.

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:03.320
Son.

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.799
Make another gourd.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.320
Long vines, many seeds.

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.480
Bless my son with a long life.

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:09.639
Many children, much fortune.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.639
Father.

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:12.440
Aren't you thinking too far ahead?

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:13.559
Not at all.

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:15.799
My son is old enough to marry and have children.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.240
I'll find a matchmaker for you.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.679
No, no.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:19.759
Arrange a marriage for my son.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:20.559
In the future,

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:23.240
Give me seventy or eighty grandsons.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.039
Old man.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:26.840
I advise you to drop the idea of arranged marriage.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.919
Feudal.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.519
We should value free love.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.279
Free love.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.279
Love, love.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.679
What, what love?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.519
Love.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.559
Father.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.679
I have something important to discuss with you.

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:40.559
What's so important?

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.200
This Liuli is selling well.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.440
But our workshop is too small.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.799
I'm thinking,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.440
to buy an old kiln factory.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.399
And renovate it.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.840
Father, what do you think?

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:55.080
Today,

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:58.440
It's probably not just about buying a kiln, right?

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:00.120
Father, you know me best.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.159
This coal factory,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.960
has solved part

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.600
of the employment problem for veterans.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.320
But it's still not enough.

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.639
Right now, this glass factory

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.360
is the best choice.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.120
But we still need to expand our sales channels.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.039
Expand, expand.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:19.519
What, Master?

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.000
What expand, Duke?

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:22.120
Someone from the palace is here.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.279
His Majesty has an order.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:29.759
Summon Shi Feifan to the palace.

00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:35.039
Father, my chance is here.

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:56.759
Your humble servant Shi Feifan greets the Empress.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.919
Fan'er.

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:00.039
Let Aunt have a look at you.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.759
Haven't seen you in years, you've grown taller.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.720
Thank you, Aunt.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.279
Come.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.559
What do you think of my painting?

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:19.000
A waterfall plunges straight from the sky.

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.759
Thunder rushes into the river, never stopping.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.240
Aunt, your waterfall painting is magnificent.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.399
Grand and majestic.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.279
The people on both sides of the river

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.720
all say the river passes by their door.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.159
All claim it belongs to their family.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.679
If it were you, how would you judge?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.679
The people rely on the river to thrive.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.759
Our dynasty's rivers all originate from De Tian Shan.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.240
So no matter where it flows,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.720
the water's source remains De Tian Shan.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.720
And that mountain is in Da Nan Chao.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.519
Of course, it belongs to the nation.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.000
Well said.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.600
Fan'er has great vision, not an ordinary man.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.320
I have something nice to give you, Aunt.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.039
What is this?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.679
Why is it so clear?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120
This is called a glass mirror.

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:17.879
It perfectly shows your natural beauty, Aunt.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.080
Unmatched elegance.

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:22.200
You,

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:24.679
have a clever tongue just like your mother.

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:26.799
If you like it, Aunt,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.279
everything I make in the future

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.000
will be presented to you first.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.679
However,

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:33.799
I have a small request.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.639
I hope Your Majesty will agree.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.279
I wish to do business in the palace.

00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:57.000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.519
Twenty-eighty split.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:05.440
Is Your Majesty satisfied?

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.399
Why did Imperial Brother summon him?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.159
Young Duke.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.320
Why did His Majesty call you?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.159
It was the Empress.

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.879
The Empress liked the Liuli.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.200
She asked how I made it.

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:42.679
That's all.

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:44.360
That's all.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.080
But

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.759
I didn't go for nothing.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.600
Her Majesty agreed I can do business in the palace.

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:51.399
But the condition is

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.360
new products must be tested in the palace first.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.159
Why test them in the palace?

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.159
You know,

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:58.600
people in the palace are knowledgeable.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.639
They're quick to accept new things.

00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:03.720
Most importantly, they're rich and willing to spend.

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.960
They can serve as Key Opinion Leaders

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.720
and influence trends across all levels.

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:09.159
That way,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.919
the product will sell easily.

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:13.120
What's K?

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:14.440
What does that even mean?

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:16.600
Doesn't matter.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.399
As long as we have them,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.240
new products will sell even better.

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.120
This is delicious.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.279
Yeah.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.159
So tasty.

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.120
Try this one.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.759
You should eat more too.

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.919
Waiter, another plate of meat.

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:35.080
Coming!

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:36.279
Brother Lin, you're here too.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.480
Join our table.

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:38.759
Come, sit with us.

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:13.600
Stop!

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.360
Who is it?
