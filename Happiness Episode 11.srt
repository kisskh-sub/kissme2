Why didn't you tell us 
Andrew's a murderer?

16
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:13,732
I thought he was just blackmailing.

17
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:16,801
You said you just needed supplies.

18
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,202
That you didn't care about anything else.

19
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:21,072
I only opened the door 
because Ms. Oh asked me to.

20
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:24,182
I had no idea something like this 
was going to happen.

21
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:25,782
I didn't either.

22
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:28,051
Because it was Mr. Oh's plan.

23
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:40,532
Who are you?

24
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,262

Sae Bom.

27
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,071
Jung Guk, wake up.

28
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,312
Look after him.

29
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,312
I'll take Seo Yoon.

30
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:52,131
I'll come for you later.

31
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,902
Hang in there.

32
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:13,451
You don't have a scar on your face.

33
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:15,052
Go to the gym.

34
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:16,562
I'll bring the two when they're ready.

35
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,261
Can we not get any food right now?

36
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:22,592
They're still inside.

37
00:03:27,302 --> 00:03:28,601
Let's wait downstairs.

38
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:31,772
There's nothing worth seeing here.

39
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:36,641
The situation here isn't ideal for a child...

40
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:42,782
Mr. Attorney.

41
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,022
You wait here.

42
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,391
There was a loud noise, wasn't there?

43
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,802
Is your brother doing okay?

44
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,772
You visit him quite often.

45
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,472
You didn't go with her, did you?

46
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,742
My brother is perfectly normal.

47
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,911
He's being very careful.

48
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:11,041
And his scratch is just the same.

49
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,411
Let's go downstairs. 
We must discuss Unit 501.

50
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,252
The others will join us 
when they're ready.

51
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:18,451
Let's go.

52
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,791
What a mess.

53
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:38,441
Yi Hyun, get the first-aid kit and some water.

54
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:44,782
Jung Guk. I'll have a look.

55
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:57,761
Hang in there.

56
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,562
You can see a doctor 
as soon as you get out.

57
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:04,032
If I end up dying,

58
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,702
tell my wife...

59
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,301
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:13,142
And that I love her.

61
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,371
Tell her that yourself.

62
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:17,512
You can get help outside.

63
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,351
You really think I won't die?

64
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:22,782
You won't.

65
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,351
You just have a small hole in your side.

66
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,351
It's really small?

67
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:30,322
Are you sure?

68
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:49,241
Hang in there.

69
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:57,851

71

Yi Hyun.

72
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:03,861
Look at me.

73
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,462
We will get out alive...

74
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,532
and put...

75
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,001
all those people away.

76
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,411

so have medics on standby.

81

82
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,722
Don't. He has Seo Yoon.

83
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,351
It'll be dangerous if you come in.

85
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,262
I thought about why you were doing this.

Sae Bom...

87
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,231
has the antibodies, doesn't she?

88
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:19,601
What if she does?

89
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,472
You must give us what we want.

90
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,911

Watch her for a bit.

93
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,931
I'm not a bad man.

94
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:49,532
What's your name?

95
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:57,171
I know who you are.

96
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:00,012
Where are you going? 
We need to get tested.

97
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,072
I'm going to a hospital.

00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,751
didn't you?

102
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:19,322
How many people...

103
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,431
did you kill with that mask on?

104

(Ahn Guk Jin)

105
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:24,662
That's what infected people do too.

106
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:26,391
They conceal their infection...

107
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,731
and hide among regular people 
to look for their prey.

108
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,761
Those people are sick.

109
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:34,972
But you are crazy by nature.

110
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,302
Sir.

111
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,412
How long have you known?

112
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,141
I heard you started this whole thing.

113
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,412
It's been a few days.

114
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,121
I saw Andrew getting rid of the cleaning lady.

115
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,062
Hold on!

116
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:02,531
Wait.

117
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:04,761
Andrew.

118
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:06,731
The unit on the 11th floor is empty.

119
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:08,601
Wouldn't it be better to hide her body there?

120
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,241
Cut her throat or something.

121
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:12,501
They might think that it was done 
by an infected person.

122
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:15,741
So...

123
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:18,182
I told the resident representative right away.

124
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,182
I am here to offer you a deal.

125
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:25,182
There's a way to get rid of people 
you might not be keen on.

126
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:27,851
And she got on board too.

127
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:29,751
So I told Andrew...

128
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,222
that he could get what he wanted,

129
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,562
but in return, he had to help us.

130
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,861
You should all thank me.

131
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,761
I didn't want to bring this up.

132
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:40,202
But I'm the cream of the crop in our society.

133
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,432
I even had to put up an act 
to fool that couple on the fifth floor.

134
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:43,802
It was for your sake.

135
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:46,542
How did you get into...

136
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,412
Mr. Kim's house?

137
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,942
He opened the door 
when I mentioned your name.

138
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:56,922
Ms. Yoon Sae Bom is hurt.

139
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,082
You have a first-aid kit, right?

140
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,332
I would have beaten you up less 
if you had done what I asked.

141
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,302
(I made a mistake I cannot fix.)

142
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:28,511
Andrew.

143
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,422
This is lime powder.

144
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:33,121
We can get rid of everything with this powder.

145
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:43,131
You can talk there.

146
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,501
It makes me uneasy whenever you move.

147
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:47,832
Jung Guk is injured.

148
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:51,802
He has to go to the hospital.

149
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,011
After you two do what I tell you to do.

150
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,641
You can get out of here, right?

151
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,481
And...

152
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,381
are you in contact with anyone outside?

153
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,292
What are you talking about?

154
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:11,322
Explain it so we can understand too.

155
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:20,601
We already told the cleaning crew and the lawyer,

156
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:23,432
but we didn't have a chance to update you two.

157
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:26,972
You even talked to my husband?

158
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,072
Yes.

159
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,141
We went to see him.

160
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:33,312
He was happy 
that there was a lot of food on the fifth...

161
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:35,682
and 15th floors.

162
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:48,692
What's going on?

163
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,631
Jung Yi Hyun had it.

164
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:08,582
You've been reporting...

165
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:12,121
to them about what was happening here 
the whole time?

166
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,391
You two must have gotten 
some special treatment from them.

167
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,922
In exchange for keeping an eye on us.

168
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:20,932
Hello?

169
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,162
Is anyone there?

00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:30,072
This is the resident representative of Building 101.

171
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,371
I am in charge of the apartment.

172
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:34,972
You can tell me everything.

173
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:43,511
Hello?

174
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:47,891
Is anyone listening?

175
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:49,792
I already told them.

176
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,731
Told them what?

177
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:59,501
Did you spread rumours 
based on your ridiculous imagination?

178
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,832
Yes. I told them everything.

179
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,141
They will make decisions about your action.

180
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,412
The two of you...

181
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:10,912
will go to prison for attempted murder.

182
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:16,151
How will you ever face your son?

183
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:21,021
I only agreed 
because they said they would give us food.

184
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:23,792
I really didn't know this would happen. 
I'm serious.

185
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,692
Food had to come from somewhere.

186
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,861
You must have known...

187
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,001
someone was going to get hurt.

188
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:33,771
You only agreed because...

189
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,401
you would get food 
if you turned a blind eye to it.

190
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:37,802
No.

191
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,302
We don't have to worry now.

192
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,942
Right now, the most important thing 
is getting through the lock down.

193
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,342
Besides,

194
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:51,952
the couple from the fifth floor...

195
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,322
will turn on the emergency switch-over
in the Electrical Room.

196
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:56,491
Right.

197
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:58,991
Yes. Go and turn on the power.

198
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,261
So you can take the girl with you.

199
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:04,302
If anyone asks you later why this happened,

200
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,832
just say that a crazy guy with a gun was responsible.

201
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,131
So...

202
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,802
are you telling us to condone this crime?

203
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,751
What?

204
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:30,822
Am I wrong?

205
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:33,792
Don't hurt other people!

206
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,031
If both of us come after you at the same time,

207
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:41,401
you might die too.

208
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:49,011
Yes. You two have a lot to get done. 
I can't fight with you now.

209
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,312
Ms. Na.

210
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,481
You don't have to stay here. Go home.

211
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:56,912
You too, Ms. Shin.

212
00:15:58,452 --> 00:15:59,621
Your husband...

213
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,952
is probably with Seo Yoon in my house.

214
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:04,592
She must be in shock.

215
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:07,361
Can you look after her at your house?

216
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,292
Sure.

217
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:19,942
Come back after you turn on the power.

218
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:23,141
Then I'll let Seo Yoon and the detective leave.

219
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:28,011
Want to come with us?

220
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,962
Seo Yoon.

221
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,531
I'm fine.

222
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,131
I'm all right.

223
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,001
Stay in the living room.

224
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:48,401
I'm afraid...

225
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:50,641
I might've been infected.

226
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:57,741
Stay there. I'm fine.

227
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:03,052
Mr. Kook. Can you take Seo Yoon...

228
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,851
to your house?

229
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,651
I don't think she should stay here.

230
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,121
Right, kid. Stop breathing so heavily.

231
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:11,462
Come with me.

232
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:16,332
If you stay here,

233
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:18,332
you'll see that scary man again.

234
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,572
You don't want him to scold you, right?

235
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:22,672
Honey.

236
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:24,842
What are you doing?

237
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,641
I'm glad you're here. 
Her name sounds like yours.

238
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:29,511
Go talk to her.

239
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:34,212
Andrew has a gun, 
and he threatened the couple on the fifth floor.

240
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:38,151
That guy is completely insane. 
He must be a murderer.

241
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,281
Let's ignore it.

242
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,292
We just need to keep hiding 
until the lock down ends.

243
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:48,092
Did you help him?

244
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:50,361
Who do you take me for?

245
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:55,271
Ms. Oh told me about it.

246
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:56,902
That I just need to help him.

247
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:59,071
You weren't this kind of a person.

248
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,642
When you were a public defender,

249
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,672
you took care of people 
who were unfairly charged.

250
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:05,712
You'd even split up your time to go investigate.

251
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:08,051
And what did I gain from that?

252
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:10,051
I need to find a way to live too!

253
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:15,991
Darn it. Where did the kid go?

254
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,761
Hey, kid. Let's go.

255
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:20,892
Hurry up.

256
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,862
I want to go with her.

257
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,612
Okay, Seo Yoon. Let's go.

258
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:38,011
But Mr. Kim...

259
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,091
Seo Yoon said...

260
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:53,261
she wanted you to come with us.

261
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,991
I'm sorry,

262
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,962
but I don't think I can take the stairs.

263
00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:00,202
Please take care of Seo Yoon.

264
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:03,972
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:18,682
We'll go down.

266
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,622
Make sure you don't die in Andrew's hands.

267
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:26,392
Think about how you can live 
without being an embarrassment too.

268
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:31,061
Hey. Aren't you going to give us some kind of weapon?

269
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:32,932
Like a baseball bat.

270
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:35,531
You said that the infected were people too.

271
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,071
Resolve it with a conversation.

272
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:40,811
Come back here after you're done.

273
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:42,372
We should go check on Seo Yoon after.

274
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,212
Hey.

275
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:49,581
I'll go with you.

276
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:18,682
That's where the senior center 
in Building 103 is.

277
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:24,122
- You should wait here. 
- What?

278
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,021
There's no need to expose yourself to danger.

279
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,321
Just stay here. 
When the lights go on, go up.

280
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:30,551
Would that be okay?

281
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:32,422
Why did you come with us?

282
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:34,491
You're not here to film either.

283
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,932
That's my car.

284
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,702
I have no place to go now.

285
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:44,402
I'm going to try to break through the shutters 
with my car to get out.

286
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:56,382
Good luck.

287
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:57,581
Thank you.

288
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:58,682
Let's go.

289
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,942
Hold on. Over there.

290
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:34,251
(Electrical Room)

291
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:42,791
(Authorized Personnel Only)

292
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:27,571
(DPF Regenerative Apparatus)

293
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:28,642
Yi Hyun.

294

(Emergency Generator)

(Emergency Power)

296
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:01,172
The infected are going to gather here
 because of the sound.

297
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:14,051
(Authorized Personnel Only)

298
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:06,442
This way.

299
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:16,682
(Lee Deok Soon)

300
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,091
Why did you bring us here?

301
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:27,791
Andrew might try to kill us if we go up.

302
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:29,491
He'll be waiting for us by the elevator or stairs...

303
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:31,162
for Units 1 and 2.

304
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:33,761
He'll never think we'd come from the units over.

305
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,602
(Seyang Forest Le Ciel Apartment)

306
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:54,021
There was nobody in Units 3 or 4 on the 15th floor.

307
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:56,751
We just need to get out of here 
with Seo Yoon and Jung Guk.

308
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:04,261
(Seyang Forest Le Ciel Apartment)

309
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:13,301
Let's go.

310
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:27,251
What is this? What's wrong with this?

311
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,791
Darn it.

312
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:30,591
Why won't it start?

313
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,081
Please!

314
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,791
Andrew. You've been through so much.

315
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:08,662
Don't you think...

316
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:12,202
the apartment should hold on to the gun?

317
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:16,501
Andrew.

318
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:19,902
When the couple from the fifth floor comes up,

319
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:22,942
will you get rid of them?

320
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:28,511
Once the lock down ends,

321
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,882
will you leave right away?

322
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:34,081
Yes, I should look into a different apartment.

323
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:35,692
You were behind...

324
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:37,551
everything that happened here.

325
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:39,462
We didn't know anything.

326
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:41,731
You understand that, right?

327
00:26:46,102 --> 00:26:47,972
Are you guys okay with that?

328
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,632
Of course. We don't know anything.

329
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,942
Water? We'll go get some water.

330
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:57,841
Get on. We need to get food from Unit 502.

331
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,652
We're going to stop at the second floor first.

332
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:02,712
Go ahead.

333
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:09,422
What? Andrew isn't a bad person!

334
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:12,622
You must be out of your mind! 
What's wrong with you? You idiot!

335
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:21,531
Andrew, why did you cover up 
that handsome face all this time?

336
00:27:23,271 --> 00:27:24,402
Go on up.

337
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:26,602
I'm going to kill the cop couple 
when they come up.

338
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:28,811
Let's go.

339
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:39,652
After we save the others,

340
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:41,622
can we get them out?

341
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,152
What if Mr. Han doesn't accept them?

342
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:46,321
He will take them.

343
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,261
You have...

344
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:52,862
the antibodies.

345
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:56,231
I do?

346
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,142
So he used Seo Yoon as an excuse...

347
00:27:58,402 --> 00:27:59,642
to get you.

348
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,412
You're the only person in the world 
with the antibodies.

349
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:16,122
Stay in there!

350
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:23,392
Come on, Yi Hyun. Get in!

351
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:50,447
Yi Hyun.

352
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:51,816
This...

353
00:28:59,957 --> 00:29:01,027
I'm sorry.

354
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,297
I couldn't tell you.

355
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:08,437
Sorry for breaking our promise.

356
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:18,346
I always wanted to...

357
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:21,376
show you my best side.

358
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:53,547
Don't come too close.

359
00:29:55,447 --> 00:29:56,646
Whenever I see you,

360
00:29:57,987 --> 00:29:59,257
my heart beats faster,

361
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:01,687
and I feel thirsty.

362
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:05,096
So do I.

363
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:09,826
Because I like you.

364
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:50,537
Come with me.

365
00:30:51,437 --> 00:30:52,707
You'll get better.

366
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:54,237
I'll make sure of that.

367
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:05,217
There must be a reason you're so obsessed.

368
00:31:05,457 --> 00:31:07,187
You locked the infected in freezer trucks...

369
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,187
and even came in here.

370
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:12,556
I'm infected.

371
00:31:14,326 --> 00:31:16,096
This will be the last favour I ask for.

372
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,177
What is it?

373
00:31:26,507 --> 00:31:29,007
I think they activated 
the emergency power system.

374
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,277
Move the barricades to the parking lot.

375
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:33,616
Put them back after Sae Bom gets out.

376
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:35,947
Jung Yi Hyun is infected.

377
00:31:36,717 --> 00:31:37,816
If he threatens Sae Bom,

378
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:40,086
tell them to shoot.

379
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:46,356
Bo Ram.

380
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:49,626
Lee Bo Ram!

381
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:54,836
Bo Ram. Open the door.

382
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,497
What'll you do now?

383
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:23,866
Do you have a plan for Andrew?

384
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,136
Future apartment representative.

385
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:28,437
The police can deal with him.

386
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,806
We can send him to prison 
when things get better.

387
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,037
We didn't even know he was a murderer.

388
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,517
Will you say you knew?

389
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:41,646
Gosh, no.

390
00:32:41,947 --> 00:32:43,547
Do whatever you want.

391
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:45,616
You take all the food,

392
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:48,217
and you can be healthy and happy.

393
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:49,957
You must be...

394
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:52,997
so pleased to have a plan.

395
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:54,227
Just like in the movies.

396
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,267
You won't take anything?

397
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:05,207
I want to get something else first.

398
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:06,707
Oh, right.

399
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:08,277
If you see any pills,

400
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:09,876
call me right away.

401
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,547
If you find any supplements.

402
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,186
I was just fooling around.

403
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:01,057
I only came in here to find the pills.

404
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,097
Do you want some if I find any?

405
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:04,666
If you take them,

406
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,766
you can survive almost anything.

407
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:17,047
Hyun Kyung, get over here.

408
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:18,407
Come and turn on the AC.

409
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:20,916
Did they cancel the lock down?

410
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:23,217
There's a huge mess outside.

411
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:26,286
Andrew's a complete psycho.

412
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:27,717
What's wrong?

413
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:33,827
He threatened the fifth-floor couple
to turn on the emergency power.

414
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:36,967
Didn't Andrew have a crush on you?

415
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:38,066
What?

416
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:39,297
Don't be silly.

417
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,036
What now?

418
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:46,036
We can't just wait.

419
00:34:46,706 --> 00:34:47,737
Hey.

420
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:49,347
Why can't we just wait?

421
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:52,117
Hide in here and enjoy the AC.

422
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,217
What power do we have?

423
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:58,186
Plus, I'm infected.

424
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:03,186
But still,

425
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:05,456
they helped us.

426
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:12,197
(Welcome to OPbit.)

427
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:13,297
(No internet connection)

428
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:23,146
What were you doing?

429
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:25,677
Nothing.

430
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:41,456
Hey, you still haven't given up?

431
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,827
What can you do when there's no internet...

432
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:51,266
Don't you need to charge your phone? 
Go get it.

433
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:55,376
Get some food and water from Unit 501.

434
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:57,547
Me?

435
00:35:57,976 --> 00:35:59,447
Will you stay here with Seo Yoon, then?

436
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:06,586
There will be nothing left 
if the others get there first.

437
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:14,927
You can go next time.

438
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:42,226
Hey, So Yoon. What's this? 
What are you doing?

439
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:44,057
You take other people for granted.

440
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:46,327
And you only care about yourself, 
so all you do is complain.

441
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:47,557
Nothing is your fault.

442
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:49,527
And you say you don't have a choice 
and rationalize your mistakes.

443
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,396
I'm so sick of you.

444
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:55,097
Hey. So Yoon.

445
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:56,407
Shin So Yoon!

446
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:05,416
Be careful.

447
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:07,717
Don't worry.

448
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:10,947
Go and bring Jung Guk safely.

449
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,527
Hold on. Is this about Sang Hee?

450
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:27,867
I told you so many times 
that nothing happened between us.

451
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:29,637
Look. Oh Ju Hyung invested...

452
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:30,867
the money he embezzled in a cryptocurrency.

453
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:33,376
She wanted to split it with me. 
That's all.

454
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:36,307
I wanted to make a lot of money for you.

455
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:39,447
The world is about to come to an end.

456
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:40,777
You think you can make money with that now?

457
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:43,947
No. Listen. You don't know 
what you're talking about.

458
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:45,856
You don't know what block chain is, right?

459
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,617
That's the future.

460
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:50,927
The more chaotic the world gets, 
the more valuable they will...

461
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:52,726
What was that? Hey.

462
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:56,027
Let go of me. Hey, that hurts. 
Fine. Let go of me.

463
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:59,036
Ms. Shin, it's me. Open up.

464
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:00,097
Sae Bom!

465
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:04,036
So Yoon. Tell her 
that this is all a misunderstanding.

466
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:06,836
I kept the girl safe. 
That's a fact.

467
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,947
- Come on. Darn it.
- You can let him go.

468
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,106
He's too chicken to fight back.

469
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:16,316
Come on.

470
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:22,757
Sae Bom, that was quick.

471
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,557
I kept my promise, right?

472
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:27,856
Does your chest still feel heavy?

473
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:32,936
But Mr. Kim seemed really sick.

474
00:38:33,237 --> 00:38:34,237
Right.

475
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:36,367
He'll come out with us.

476
00:38:45,077 --> 00:38:46,277
What about Andrew?

477
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:49,916
He's probably waiting for us downstairs.

478
00:38:50,117 --> 00:38:52,657
You two will never get out of here anyway.

479
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:55,527
We're all locked in here.

480
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,637
Are you going to kill me here?

481
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:11,536
Just like you killed my husband?

482
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:24,646
Help me.

483
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:27,586
He's going to kill me.

484
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:30,786
Don't worry. I'm not leaving.

485
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:33,896
Stay here for now.

486
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,226
If you let her take the girl,

487
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:40,467
that lunatic, Andrew, will be furious.

488
00:39:40,536 --> 00:39:42,967
So you'll hand her over 
to a murderer to save yourself?

489
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:47,436
Ms. Shin, we're going to leave this apartment.

490
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:50,907
Do you want to come with us?

491
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:54,746
Mr. Kim!

492
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:59,786
Seo Yoon, I'm happy to see you too.

493
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,217
But I'm sick right now.

494
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:03,186
Be gentle. Okay?

495
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:09,226
So Yoon. Calm down.

496
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:11,726
Let's go back home and lock the door.

497
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:15,666
I saw the absolute worst in you.

498
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:17,436
We're over.

499
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:29,487
So Yoon.

500
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:40,496
It's yours.

501
00:40:45,597 --> 00:40:46,597
Thanks.

502
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:11,686
Darn it. I said no!

503
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:13,027
You saw his eyes!

504
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,927
- Stop it! Calm down!
- Let go of me!

505
00:41:14,996 --> 00:41:18,027
We were trying to save a lot of money for our son!

506
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:21,836
Andrew. We were just...

507
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,566
Stay here. And if you see the couple 
from the fifth floor,

508
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:25,677
keep them here.

509
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:29,646
Hey. Hold on. Andrew.

510
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:33,217
I'll pay you well. Please.

511
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:35,376
Please. I...

512
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:44,286
Without the gun...

513
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:46,757
Honey, you can do it!

514
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,297
Take the gun!

515
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:53,367
Hey!

516
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:56,106
Get off him!

517
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:58,166
(SY Home Cleaning)

518
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:03,407
No!

519
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:09,217
Oh, no. Should I pull it out?

520
00:42:09,286 --> 00:42:11,086
Goodness. Should I pull it out?

521
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:13,617
Ma'am, don't pull it out.

522
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:15,086
He'll die.

523
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,137
What a crazy way to lose weight.

524
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:33,476
We're almost there. Hang in there.

525
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:38,807
Bo Ram, do you want to come with us?

526
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:41,777
Can I?

527
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:52,057
Yoon Sae Bom.

528
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:16,316
I'll stop him here. Go!

529
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:18,316
What are you talking about? 
You're coming with us!

530
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:41,277
I'm sorry I can't go with you.

531
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:47,217
Yi Hyun!

532
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:54,257
Sae Bom.

533
00:43:56,856 --> 00:43:58,057
I was truly happy...

534
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,126
to be with you.

535
00:44:04,396 --> 00:44:05,726
Stop saying that.

536
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:08,097
Open up now.

537
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:09,936
Hurry.

538
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:12,137
Never give up.

539
00:44:14,936 --> 00:44:17,077
Yi Hyun!

540
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,257
I hear someone coming up.

541
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:38,496
Leave him alone.

542
00:44:39,097 --> 00:44:40,666
I'm coming right back.

543
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,166
Let's go. Jung Guk.

544
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:47,206
Darn it.

545
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:50,277
Hey.

546
00:44:50,907 --> 00:44:52,816
That's new. So it won't break.

547
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:54,547
Hold on.

548
00:44:58,186 --> 00:44:59,257
Do you want it?

549
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:14,197
"Goodness, Jung Yi Hyun."

550
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:18,836
"The ball Jung Yi Hyun pitches 
goes straight down."

551
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,936
"And the hitter Andrew 
can't seem to do anything about it."

552
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:25,347
"It was a fast ball. Indeed."

553
00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:29,117
"Jung Yi Hyun comes back 
after a long hiatus!"

554
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:32,617
"He makes the pitch of a lifetime!"

555
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:44,097
Hey.

556
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:47,436
I would've joined the MLB 
if it hadn't been for my injury.

557
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:55,137
Your wife ran away. 
Are you cool with that?

558
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:57,206
She's the best.

559
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:00,146
I met her on a rooftop like this.

560
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:02,047
And I fell in love with her.

561
00:46:04,016 --> 00:46:05,487
It was a clear day...

562
00:46:07,387 --> 00:46:09,356
with a beautiful blue sky.

563
00:46:12,057 --> 00:46:13,427
Saying goodbye to her...

564
00:46:15,396 --> 00:46:16,527
on a clear day...

565
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:20,967
on a rooftop like this...

566
00:46:21,797 --> 00:46:22,807
sounds perfect.

567
00:46:41,617 --> 00:46:42,956
How boring.

568
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:47,197
Hey. Look at me.

569
00:46:48,157 --> 00:46:49,896
My victims need to look at me for it to be fun.

570
00:47:34,212 --> 00:47:35,552
What does this say?

571
00:48:01,641 --> 00:48:02,712
Sang Hee.

572
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,481
So Yoon ran away.

573
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:07,681
That's good.

574
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:10,552
There's something I need you to do.

575
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:13,021
What about Oh Ju Hyung?

576
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:14,951
What is that?

577
00:48:16,222 --> 00:48:17,322
He must have high blood pressure.

578
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,222
He collapsed out of nowhere.

579
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:25,831
Take a look at the letters.

580
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:27,331
What does it say?

581
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,242
- Honey. 
- Yes?

582
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:39,012
Oh, right.

583
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:42,552
Isn't that a doctor's script? 
When they write prescriptions.

584
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,322
Don't you know? 
I thought you worked at a hospital.

585
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:47,092
I only do consultations.

586
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:48,822
Don't you have your phone?

587
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:52,061
It's at home.

588
00:48:54,092 --> 00:48:55,862
He's alive.

589
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:02,172
Hey, is that for your blood pressure?

590
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:26,331
Here.

591
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,291
Take a look at these letters.

592
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:33,331
If you get it wrong ten times,

593
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,731
we can't take out the money.

594
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,572
Okay. I'll try my best.

595
00:50:49,612 --> 00:50:50,782
You have to get up.

596
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:52,212
Get up. Try moving your legs.

597
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:53,382
You have to get up.

598
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:55,911
Why can't I move my legs?

599
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,021
Get up!

600
00:50:57,581 --> 00:50:58,722
Ms. Oh!

601
00:50:58,981 --> 00:51:00,351
Please help him.

602
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:01,822
My husband is hurt.

603
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,322
Please help us.

604
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:04,822
What happened?

605
00:51:05,822 --> 00:51:07,331
Andrew stabbed him.

606
00:51:07,962 --> 00:51:09,161
Hurry up and bring it!

607
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:11,431
This is all your fault!

608
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,601
What about the others? 
Did you see them?

609
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:21,411
What about Andrew? Where is he?

610
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:23,041
On the 15th floor.

611
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:45,262
Hurry up and get in.

612
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:50,762
It's okay.

613
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:52,462
They're all on our side.

614
00:53:10,282 --> 00:53:11,451
Give me a gun,

615
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:12,922
so I can get Yi Hyun.

616
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:45,222
Let go. Let go of me!

617
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:16,242
Yi Hyun.

618
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:42,972
Did you lift the martial law?

619
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:46,811
Without telling any of us?

620
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:53,282
I bet you said...

621
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:57,782
each area was individually managed.

622
00:55:58,782 --> 00:55:59,782
And then...

623
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:03,692
you found my antibodies and got me out.

624
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:07,962
The counter agent I injected you with 
will make you dizzy.

625
00:56:08,962 --> 00:56:10,061
Lie down.

626
00:56:17,402 --> 00:56:18,802
This is your phone.

627
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:24,712
Who gave it to you?

628
00:56:24,942 --> 00:56:26,282
Detective Kim Jung Guk.

629
00:56:27,612 --> 00:56:28,951
He said Yi Hyun...

630
00:56:30,052 --> 00:56:31,922
told him to take it.

631
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,032
I have to get Yi Hyun.

632
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:52,371
Is he worth it?

633
00:56:54,942 --> 00:56:56,311
Wasn't it a contractual marriage?

634
00:56:56,911 --> 00:56:59,512
There are many more people out here 
that you can protect.

635
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,081
You told me that...

636
00:57:04,282 --> 00:57:07,152
the world we know could change.

637
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:10,722
I'm sorry about what happened to Yi Hyun,

638
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:13,492
but once we find a cure 
and get the situation under control,

639
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:16,032
everything you wanted...

640
00:57:17,862 --> 00:57:19,262
can be yours.

641
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:22,431
Tell the world to wait.

642
00:57:23,972 --> 00:57:25,641
I need to get Yi Hyun back.

643
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:30,681
If I lose him,

644
00:57:34,981 --> 00:57:36,922
I might really crumble.

645
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,092
There's someone I want you to see.

646
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:49,831
Is she infected?

647
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:52,831
Thanks to your plasma,

648
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,601
she no longer has outbursts,

649
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:56,572
but she doesn't have much time.

650
00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:00,242
I had you brought here with the excuse...

651
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,212
that I over-administered a sedative.

652
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,811
You'll be monitored until tomorrow, 
and if you're cleared,

653
00:58:05,212 --> 00:58:06,911
the government will take you somewhere.

654
00:58:07,411 --> 00:58:09,212
Where unauthorized personnel can't enter.

655
00:58:10,222 --> 00:58:12,451
A biosafety level four facility.

656
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:15,692
What is it that you want?

657
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,891
She needs one more round of your plasma...

658
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,962
to fully cure her.

659
00:58:24,962 --> 00:58:26,302
Then let's help each other.

660
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:29,001
I'll give you my plasma 
or whatever it is you want.

661
00:58:30,442 --> 00:58:32,271
Help me get home.

662
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,342
Keep the power on 
in the complex until then.

663
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:38,411
The emergency power...

664
00:58:39,411 --> 00:58:40,451
won't last too long.

665
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,382
Do you think Yi Hyun...

666
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:48,492
will be alive?

667
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:55,791
You bet he will.

668
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:39,041
(Photo album)

669
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,181
(To Sae Bom)

670
00:59:46,141 --> 00:59:47,152
Tada.

671
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,181
Hello, Sae Bom.

672
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:53,521
I'm sorry I never proposed to you properly.

673
00:59:55,322 --> 00:59:56,322
Back then,

674
00:59:58,021 --> 01:00:00,831
it looked like I agreed for the apartment, right?

675
01:00:01,992 --> 01:00:03,231
That's not true.

676
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:07,032
I kept saying I liked you.

677
01:00:08,132 --> 01:00:09,302
In case you got the wrong idea.

678
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:11,972
I'm not an easy guy to nab.

679
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:15,072
Getting an apartment is important,

680
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:19,012
but who you're with is more important.

681
01:00:19,512 --> 01:00:20,512
Right?

682
01:00:22,081 --> 01:00:24,552
Mr. Jung, what are you doing with Sae Bom's phone?

683
01:00:24,851 --> 01:00:28,021
Seo Yoon, pretend you didn't see that.

684
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:31,192
He's madly in love. 
Pretend he's invisible.

685
01:00:31,262 --> 01:00:33,532
Let's go. Come with me.

686
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:37,331
I hope we get out...

687
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:39,962
and get to watch this together.

688
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:42,771
When we do,

689
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:45,172
I'll say it properly.

690
01:00:47,112 --> 01:00:48,342
That I like you.

691
01:01:06,222 --> 01:01:07,231
Tada.

692
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:09,291
Hello, Sae Bom.

693
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,632
I'm sorry I never proposed to you properly.

694
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:16,472
Back then,

695
01:01:18,172 --> 01:01:20,911
it looked like I agreed for the apartment, right?

696
01:01:22,072 --> 01:01:23,242
That's not true.

697
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,112
I kept saying I liked you.

698
01:01:28,212 --> 01:01:29,351
In case you got the wrong idea.

699
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:32,081
I'm not an easy guy to nab.

700
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:35,092
Getting an apartment is important...

701
01:01:37,722 --> 01:01:44,731
(Wonjung University Student Dormitories)

702
01:01:51,001 --> 01:01:55,942
=Happiness=

703
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:15,731
I bit Andrew.

704
01:02:16,391 --> 01:02:17,561
If he's alive,

705
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,132
we must get him.

706
01:02:20,632 --> 01:02:23,032
He put Andrew somewhere and lied to me.

707
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:24,871
I will kill him.

708
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,371
Your antibody count is falling.

709
01:02:27,012 --> 01:02:28,612
You want to kill a scholar?

710
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:31,641
You're infected.

711
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:35,052
You are the real monsters, not the infected.

712
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:38,052
I will deal with Yoon Sae Bom.

713
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:39,081
What about Yi Hyun?

714
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,621
Is he alive?
