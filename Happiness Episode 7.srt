00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:18,412
She's busy right now.

17
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,482
She'll be right out. Wait here.

Did you take the pill...

19
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,192
you bought at the gym?

I will kill you.

22
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,403
There's a misunderstanding.

23
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:44,503
Then open it.

24
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:07,663
Where's Sae Bom?

25
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,092
Sae Bom!

26
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:11,403
Hey.

27
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,032
Yi Hyun.

28
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,403
Are you hungry too?

29
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:17,842
What?

30
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:32,422
No.

31
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,193
I came here because I missed you.

32
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:36,663
- Help me out.
- What?

33
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:37,892
- Help me out. Get up.
- What?

34
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:38,993
Just get up.

35
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,633
We're newlyweds.

36
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,002
I just miss her so much.

37
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:51,043
When I'm out of his sight just for a moment,

38
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,073
he worries about me.

39
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,273
You must...

40
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,343
love her a lot.

41
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:03,022
Of course.

42
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:16,332
What happened? What is it?

43
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,103
Do you want one?

44
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:22,402
He has a lot of cool stuff here. Look.

45
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:24,543
And he has a lot of food too.

47
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,843

51

Bye.

52
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:40,693
Thanks for the food.

53
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,192
Hey, why did you do that?

54
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:47,033
I think he's the type to hold grudges.

55
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,133
The trainer said...

56
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,103
he sold the pills to that guy.

57
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,702
Don't turn around.
He might be watching us.

58
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,133
No way.

59
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,202
He's not some spy.

60
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:05,043
Let me see.

61
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,413
Did you get hurt?

62
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,482
Did you get scratched?
Like on the back of your neck.

63
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:09,952
Anything?

64
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:16,922
It's taking a long time to heal.

65
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:19,832
It's almost healed.
I can barely see it now.

66
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:25,432
By the way,
did you see anything weird inside?

67
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:26,573
Other than the interior props.

68
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,702
His father is a diplomat.

69
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:32,003
So he's been to Africa
and the Middle East as a kid.

70
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:34,373
And he realized that the world
was coming to an end soon.

71
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,172
He is odd.

72
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:37,843
But he's a nice guy.

73
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,383
He gave us food.

74
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:41,082
These taste amazing...

75
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:43,883
when you are hungry.

76
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:47,623
Everything tastes good
when you are hungry.

77
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,563
Who is it?

78
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,263
Hello.

79
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:34,733
Kid.

80
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:36,772
Are you alone?

81
00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:38,943
Who are you?

82
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,113
Don't you know who I am?

83
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:41,873
I'm your mother's friend.

84
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,712
Can you open this?

85
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,152
You should...

86
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:53,753
Kid, what's wrong with you?

87
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:55,722
You hurt my arm!

88
00:05:57,962 --> 00:06:00,193
Sorry. Can you open the door?

89
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:02,292
I'm not a bad man.

90
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,462
Are you...

91
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:06,233
there?

92
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:10,873
Do you have any medicine?

93
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:13,212
What do you need it for?

94
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,313
How did you get in here?

95
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,983
The door on the first floor...

96
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:28,152
was open.

97
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,823
I'm not here to cause any trouble.

98
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,292
I didn't bite anyone.

99
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,063
I was just lonely and frustrated.

100
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:42,102
Wipe the blood off your face
before you lie through your teeth.

101
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,642
Who did you bite?

102
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,813
It was a small bite.

103
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,712
It wasn't a deep one.

104
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:58,383
The man didn't die,

105
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,022
so he ran away.

106
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:16,943
Get out before I count to three.

107
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,743
One,

108
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:23,173
two,

109
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:25,183
three.

110
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,923
Seo Yoon, it's me.

111
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,962
Seo Yoon. It's Sae Bom.

112
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,332
Did he go away?

113
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:51,443
Yes.

114
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:54,142
Where's Jung Guk?

115
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,272
On the second floor.

116
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,712
He went down
to get the dishwashing soap and toothpaste.

117
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,582
I'll be back soon.

118
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:04,753
Don't open the door for anyone.

119
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,053
Like you did before. Okay?

120
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:08,193
Good job, Seo Yoon.

121
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:12,063
Have some of this, and calm down. Okay?

122
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,292
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

123
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:16,633
- It won't take long.
- Okay.

124
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,173
How did he get in here?

125
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:30,212
There might be more infected people inside.
I need to check.

126
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:39,222
More importantly,

127
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:41,722
whose blood is that?

128
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:44,592
Hey.

129
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,022
Hey.

130
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,292
I'm not infected.

131
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,633
I'm telling the truth.
I'm not.

132
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,263
Actually,

133
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,803
I only came here because the woman from Unit 1202
said she'd pay me.

134
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:55,402
But the disease broke out,
and I'm locked in.

135
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:57,272
I can't believe this is happening!

136
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,113
Hey. I can help you.

137
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:03,883
I can help you get out of here.

138
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,142
Think about it.

139
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:07,553
Did you see me acting crazy?
I didn't.

140
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,513
I've been here the whole time. Right?

141
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:10,952
You're not thirsty?

142
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:12,952
Look.

143
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:14,753
I look fine, right?

144
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:19,022
I'm completely fine.

145
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,363
I look fine. Don't I?

146
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:23,802
I'll help you. I promise.

147
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,062
- Hey.
- Gosh.

148
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,432
You can't get out of here alone.
I'm telling you.

149
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:29,932
Help me out just this once.

150
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:39,682
Thank you.

151
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,383
I'll trust you just this once.

152
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,003
Are you okay?

153
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:08,973
I drank water.

154
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,942
But I'm still thirsty.
What am I supposed to do then?

155
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,272
Hey.

156
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,772
I'm all better now.

157
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,513
Come here. We should go upstairs together.

158
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:49,412
You're just going to stay there?

159
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,052
Until the infected people come in here?

160
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,093
Hey.

161
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,223
Just trust me!

162
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:35,932
Yi Hyun.

163
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,172
Let's hurry.

164
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:58,723
It's Na Soo Min's phone.

165
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:14,072
(Muil Group Constructions)

166
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:30,853
I drink so much water,

167
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,493
but my throat is dry.

168
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,392
Where's Na Soo Min and Na Hyun Kyung?

169
00:12:37,463 --> 00:12:38,662
I don't know.

170
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:40,863
Mr. Kim.

171
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:44,203
Inhale deeply, then exhale.

172
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:45,963
When you breathe properly,

173
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:48,833
your desires can subside.

174
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,233
No.

175
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:54,942
The more I drink water,
the thirstier I get.

176
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,713
Do you know how hard that is?

177
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:03,652
I already know what I need
to drink to quench my thirst.

178
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:07,123
What do you think will quench your thirst?

179
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:12,522
Human blood?

180
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,503
How do you know that?

181
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:21,733
Who told you?

182
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,032
I just know.

183
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,103
When I look at someone's throat,

184
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:28,373
I get even thirstier.

185
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:37,583
Did you think I didn't shoot
because I didn't have a gun?

186
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,353
What are you doing here?

187
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:49,723
I came to help you two.

188
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:44,542
Where's my brother?

189
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:48,312
We'll look for him.

190
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,552
Don't think about anything else
and get some sleep.

191
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:56,953
He must hate me right now.

192
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,363
I was the one who said we should go.

193
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,463
It's just a disease.

194
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:05,263
We just need to endure this
until the cure comes out.

195
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:09,373
Lieutenant Colonel Han,
are you almost done with the cure?

196
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:23,883
They're sleeping pills.

197
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,522
Take one pill whenever you need one.

198
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,192
Take one right now and get some rest.

199
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:37,503
There you go.

200
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,922
Why don't we go outside to talk?

201
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,572
Couldn't you have just comforted her?

202
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:19,503
Why did you shoot him?

203
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,312
Kim Seung Beom...

204
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,312
was capable of having a conversation.

205
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,942
The outside is filled with people
who have lost their families.

206
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,552
Moms bite their children,
and husbands bite their wives.

207
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,022
If you don't want to lose those close to you,

208
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,383
you shouldn't hesitate either.

209
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:38,322
Why won't this heal?

210
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:40,733
I know you looked at me
when you gave her water,

211
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:41,863
so be honest.

212
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,662
It means that the virus
is still in your system.

213
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,133
It's like the remnants of it.

214
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:48,373
Could I end up biting people like this?

215
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,503
That's why I wanted to
test your blood every two weeks.

216
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,243
We had to monitor you.

217
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:53,913
Is that why you came?

218
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,042
You wanted to take my blood?

219
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:02,582
Seo Yoon's parents...

220
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:04,382
Did something happen?

221
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,322
We verified
that her father has been infected.

222
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:07,792
Her mother is still okay,

223
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,493
but she misses her daughter deeply.

224
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:12,792
So you came to get Seo Yoon?

225
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:14,562
The mad person disease is getting worse.

226
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,233
Not only in Korea, but across the world.

227
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,062
I have follow-up measures
to tell people in the apartment.

228
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:20,673
After verifying that it's safe,

229
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:21,933
let's gather for a meeting.

230
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:38,882
Oh, Lord.

231
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:40,522
It's not over yet.

232
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,893
They said if they drank blood,
they'd get back to normal.

233
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:48,763
Maybe they bit someone, got back to normal,
and went home.

234
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,102
Is everyone inside okay?

235
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,433
Open the door!

236
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:57,403
Is there nobody inside?

237
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:04,143
Yi Hyun. Are you okay?

238
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:07,513
Are you lying to us after getting bitten?

239
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:10,683
Do you think that this is
"The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats"?

240
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:13,423
Stop with your nonsense and open up the door!

241
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,993
It could be a lie.

242
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,092
You can't fall for that annoyingly handsome face.

243
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:19,163
Oh, Lord.

244
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:20,733
Sir. I can hear you.

245
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,933
Can you open the door for me?

246
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,003
Don't.

247
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:28,802
What took you so long to open it?

248
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,403
What's with you?

249
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:33,243
I almost died!

250
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:34,842
Hey!

251
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:36,812
Wait!

252
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,513
- Darn it!
- This is driving me crazy.

253
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:41,582
But Jung Guk.

254
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:44,953
What's going on here?

255
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:46,382
Well, the thing is...

256
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,653
I came to get some detergent and toothpaste,

257
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,722
but a bunch of people with white eyes
ran at me...

258
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,923
from the emergency staircase.

259
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:53,723
Did anyone get hurt?

260
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,792
No.

261
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,963
Thanks to the reverend.

262
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,102
The reverend has spiritual powers.

263
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,193
What are you talking about?

264
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:25,393
I'm telling the truth!

265
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:26,923
No way.

266
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,062
I didn't have a gun with me...

267
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,862
Oh, right. Where's my gun?

268
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,233
Don't be like this. Calm down.

269
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,072
Who opened the door to the first floor?

270
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:38,572
That's...

271
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,872
The jobless kid upstairs.

272
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,872
He and the girl from the supermarket
opened the door and ran up.

273
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,542
Hold on, Yi Hyun.

274
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,782
Who shut the door on us earlier?

275
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:57,822
(Enduring is the answer.
Until I make 1,000 percent profits!)

277
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:00,693
(Downloading)

278
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,302
The people downstairs...
Will they be okay?

279
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,433
What if someone got hurt?

280
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:09,433
We just need to be on the same page.

281
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:12,173
We ran away from the infected too.

282
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:14,842
Then nobody can hold us responsible.

283
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:22,582
Hello.

284
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,253
You look...

285
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:29,453
so pretty.

286
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,592
What's your name?

287
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:33,423
It's Lee Bo Ram.

288
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,463
Thanks for the snacks.

289
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,163
Mom, take this.

290
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:42,503
We're busy. Get out.

291
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:44,243
Okay.

292
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,643
Tell me if you need anything.

293
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:47,872
I will.

294
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:49,473
Bye.

295
00:21:59,322 --> 00:22:00,322
Hey.

296
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,522
Don't they make a nice couple?

297
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,292
Wake up.

298
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,632
Who would like a jobless fool like him?

299
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,562
Who cares?

300
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:13,562
I married you, didn't I?

301
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:16,403
What?

302
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:22,842
I think someone's here.

303
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:24,743
Remember what I said? Tell the same story.

304
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,643
Don't go off and talk nonsense.

305
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:27,882
Don't, okay?

306
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,453
Let me talk to them. Wait here.

307
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:31,953
- But...
- We're...

308
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:39,322
The door downstairs. You opened it, didn't you?

309
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:41,433
What door?

310
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:43,393
We were here all along.

311
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:48,032
What? What is this about?

312
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:52,042
We went downstairs and the door was open,

313
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:54,173
so we got scared and ran. That's it.

314
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:55,772
Were you bitten or scratched?

315
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:58,643
I just got scared and ran off.
That's it.

316
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,522
I'm fine too. Look.

317
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:09,393
Why did you go downstairs?

318
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:27,612
- You went to get this?
- Give it to me.

319
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:28,872
I have to broadcast with that.

320
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:30,913
I risked my life to get it...

321
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,423
Because of you, someone's missing.

322
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:43,352
If you're a decent guy,

323
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:46,522
you should feel some sort of responsibility.

324
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:53,003
Are they okay?

325
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:54,132
For now.

326
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:57,743
I so wanted to punch him a few times
but didn't.

327
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:00,342
Where's Han Tae Seok?

328
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:02,072
He's on the rooftop...

329
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:03,713
to look for infected people.

330
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:08,352
Is something wrong?

331
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,013
Seo Yoon's dad.

332
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:12,322
He got infected.

333
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,122
That's why Han Tae Seok's here.

334
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:24,092
I'm here to help. You can relax.

335
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:26,062
It looks like it.

336
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,403
Did any infected people come up here?

337
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:31,072
Two people did,

338
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,802
but I told them to go downstairs that way.

339
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,382
Oh, I smashed it.

340
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:03,503
You told him to leave,

341
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,143
and he just left?

342
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,423
There are no infected people here.

343
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,022
I think Na Soo Min...

344
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,562
got infected, then left.

345
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:27,622
You know his name too.

346
00:25:28,332 --> 00:25:29,592
Did you study us?

347
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:33,332
Why are you here?

348
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,973
Ms. Yoon must've told you.

349
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:38,243
She did.

350
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:40,703
You're here for Seo Yoon.

351
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,812
But isn't it odd?

352
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:46,443
The Han Tae Seok I know isn't a humanitarian.

353
00:25:46,983 --> 00:25:49,213
You just shot a guy.

354
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,622
I don't know what you think,

355
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,183
but I'm doing this
to shut down the mad person disease.

356
00:25:54,923 --> 00:25:56,552
I'm pretty sure...

357
00:25:57,552 --> 00:25:59,022
you want that too.

358
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:10,832
Is Sae Bom really okay?

359
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:12,943
Her wound won't heal.

360
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,372
You don't have to worry
until it starts to change colour.

361
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,743
The virus is harmless...

362
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:20,643
until it reaches the brain.

363
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:23,753
Other than Sae Bom,

364
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,753
lots of people in her condition healed, right?

365
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,663
There were four.

366
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,632
The most recent test results showed
that they were infected.

367
00:26:40,203 --> 00:26:41,403
It was a matter of time.

368
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:44,203
Eventually, they succumbed too.

369
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,072
When will you have a cure?

370
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:51,342
We're looking for an antibody
that can get into the brain.

371
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:52,643
Until then, a cure...

372
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,453
can't be made.

373
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:57,683
What you're saying is...

374
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,852
The situation...

375
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:02,552
will get worse.

376
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:05,122
Until we find an antibody.

377
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,393
What are you doing here?

378
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,532
I gathered the residents. Come downstairs.

379
00:27:21,143 --> 00:27:23,042
I'll talk to Seo Yoon first.

380
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:25,183
Seo Yoon's mother asked me to pass a message.

381
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:26,842
Can I speak with her alone?

382
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:40,893
Are you Seo Yoon?

383
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,832
Aren't you the guy from TV?

384
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,163
You talked about the mad person disease.

385
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,332
You're pretty smart.

386
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,802
I get that a lot.

387
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:50,903
Can we talk for a bit?

388
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:10,822
Do you want something?

389
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:12,362
I have some rations.

390
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:21,903
Mister?

391
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:24,872
What?

392
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:26,903
Oh.

393
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:29,713
Let's have the rations later.

394
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,183
Today, I came to see how you're doing.

395
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,842
I promised your parents.

396
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:36,852
Do you know my mom and dad?

397
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:39,382
Park Yong Chul and Kang Eun Ji.

398
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:40,653
I saw them just this morning.

399
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:42,223
Do they miss me?

400
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,493
Very much.

401
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:51,503
Do you want to see them?

402
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,842
If you want,

403
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,703
you can go outside.

404
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:03,612
Can Sae Bom come with me?

405
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,983
Of course.

406
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,243
Her mother is outside as well.

407
00:29:08,453 --> 00:29:09,812
Sae Bom...

408
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,423
must miss her as much as you miss your mom.

409
00:29:29,632 --> 00:29:31,973
It's up to you. I'm here to help.

410
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,842
- Yi Hyun, you...
- If Seo Yoon leaves...

411
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:41,782
You go first.

412
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,582
What'll you do...

413
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:47,953
if you get sick?

414
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,592
Sick with what?

415
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,463
Mad person disease.

416
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,332
There's a possibility...

417
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:01,772
you'll get infected.

418
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,132
There is.

419
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,173
I could get sick too.

420
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:07,602
It's not a crime.

421
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:13,112
If...

422
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:15,112
I get infected,

423
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:20,423
and I feel the thirst
and I want to bite people,

424
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:21,822
I will tell you.

425
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,322
So...

426
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:27,062
if something happens to you, tell me.

427
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:33,862
I will.

428
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,072
I'm done.

429
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,713
Let's meet the residents.

430
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:45,683
Your son almost got us all killed.

431
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,312
How dare you glare at me
when I'm way older than you?

432
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,852
Are you sick with the disease too?

433
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:52,183
Do I have those eyes?

434
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:54,382
- Is that all you can say?
- How dare you?

435
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,622
Who on earth...

436
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:59,893
gathered us all here
without going through me?

437
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:04,763
I heard we have an outsider.

438
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:06,602
Did anyone see them?

439
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:10,733
Did you see them? Who was it?

440
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,143
A soldier.

441
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,572
Aren't you mistaken?

442
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:15,312
I doubt you can see clearly.

443
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:16,812
Was that meant to be a joke?

444
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,542
Can you get out of the way?

445
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:23,282
It's the guy on TV.

446
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:27,723
Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok
of the Crisis Management Center.

447
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,562
Sir, is the lock down over?

448
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,663
- Really?
- It's over, right?

449
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:33,862
- Can we get out now?
- Can we go home then?

450
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:35,562
- Is it over?
- Can we leave now?

451
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,562
- When can we leave?
- Really?

452
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,332
The entire city is under lock down.

453
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,872
And the power for the apartment
will be cut off tonight.

454
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:46,102
- What? Why would you do that?
- What?

455
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:48,372
Are you trying to get all of us killed?

456
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:49,743
I plan to resolve this crisis...

457
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,013
as soon as possible.

458
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,542
Then you should at least lift the lock down.

459
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,612
At least let healthy people get out of here.

460
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,453
You're infringing on our human rights.

461
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:00,223
Hey, we don't even live here.

462
00:32:00,282 --> 00:32:02,493
Forget about the lock down.
At least let us go home.

463
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:05,522
Sir, a lot of residents are fatigued.

464
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:06,693
I don't think the lock down is the answer.

465
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:11,602
Hey. You know, one of my juniors
is a one-star general.

466
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:14,802
Give me your phone. Let me make a call.

467
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:15,872
- Sir.
- Okay.

468
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:18,203
- A phone call would end this.
- Come on.

469
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,143
- That's not important right now.
- That'll clear things up.

470
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,013
- What?
- What's this sound?

471
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:28,913
- What's going on?
- What?

472
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:29,983
What's happening?

473
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:34,993
This is not a drill.

474
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:38,223
Everyone. This is not a drill.

475
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:43,292
As of now, the entire city of Seyang
is under martial law.

476
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:44,763
The martial law?

477
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,562
This is not a drill.

478
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,503
Everyone. This is not a drill.

479
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:51,032
- What?
- Come on!

480
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,042
I'll go check on Seo Yoon.

481
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:54,542
I'll go down to the gym.

482
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:56,312
- Should I go with you?
- No.

483
00:32:56,372 --> 00:32:57,872
I'll take Jung Guk with me.

484
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,013
Be careful.

485
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:05,622
If you're in danger, don't hesitate.

486
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,193
I'll take responsibility for everything
if anything happens.

487
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,493
This makes no sense.
What do you expect us to do?

488
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:11,693
- Are you serious?
- Come on. Answer our questions.

489
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:12,763
Don't worry.

490
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:16,062
- What's going on?
- Are you serious?

491
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:17,733
- Tell us what's going on.
- Come on.

492
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:20,532
- What is happening?
- Explain this to me.

493
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,302
Due to the spread of the mad person disease,

494
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:27,403
people have been spreading false rumours,

495
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:29,612
panic buying, stealing,

496
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:33,312
and assaulting others.
There has been a hike in crime.

497
00:33:33,382 --> 00:33:35,852
As public order has severely been disturbed,

498
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,582
to restore peace and order of the country,

499
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,153
protect people's lives and properties,

500
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,753
resolve this crisis to maintain order,

501
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:47,562
we declare Seyang is under martial law.

502
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:48,733
Sae Bom.

503
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:52,203
This is an announcement for the residents.

504
00:33:52,862 --> 00:33:54,463
- Do not leave your house.
- It's all right.

505
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:57,102
- Do not...
- They are just trying to scare us.

506
00:34:05,082 --> 00:34:06,243
You may have heard,

507
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:09,253
but things are dangerous outside the apartment too.

508
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:13,022
Four days.

509
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:15,022
The martial law will be lifted in four days.

510
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,393
And the degree of the lock down
will be relaxed.

511
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:19,562
Why are you cutting off the power?

512
00:34:19,963 --> 00:34:22,032
There are infected people
at the power plant too.

513
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,193
Only the buildings with priority...

514
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,562
will have electricity.

515
00:34:26,203 --> 00:34:27,862
- Your apartment is not one of them.
- What?

516
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,332
Just like the residents in this apartment,

517
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:33,072
other residents in Seyang
will be restricted to leave home.

518
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:36,312
Wait. Are things that bad outside?

519
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:39,882
We are facing a shortage of food and water overall.

520
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:43,413
Assault cases are springing up all over the city.

521
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:47,282
Then staying inside might be better.

522
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,322
All right. We've been doing well so far.

523
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:51,393
Four days?

524
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,963
Four days could go by quickly.
Don't you agree?

525
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:56,893
Trust me, and let's stay strong a bit longer.

526
00:34:59,232 --> 00:35:00,532
The mad person disease.

527
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,172
I heard that you only get that disease...

528
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,302
from taking certain pills.

529
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:10,212
Is that true?

530
00:35:11,572 --> 00:35:15,112
We are still checking any related facts
about the disease.

531
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:23,353
- Oh, no. What should we do?
- Gosh.

532
00:35:23,893 --> 00:35:25,623
I was right.

533
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,763
Please go home
and charge whatever devices you need to.

534
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,103
Fill up the sink or the bathtub with water.

535
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:35,002
Once the power is cut off,

536
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:38,502
there won't be any water.

537
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,521
Don't worry.

538
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,590
Our people are known to be good
at overcoming national crises.

539
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:54,400
Thank you, sir.

540
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:06,481
I'll go and fill up the bathtub at my house too.

541
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,050
Seo Yoon.

542
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,851
You talked to the military guy. Right?

543
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:19,860
I don't know how things are outside.

544
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,530
It could be better than this.

545
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,260
Or it could be worse.

546
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:29,530
Do you want to see your parents?

547
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,970
I don't drink a lot of water.

548
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,751
I'm not asking this
because I want you to go.

549
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,050
If you want to stay here,

550
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,920
I'll protect you the best I can.

551
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:51,420
And I'll help you meet your parents.

552
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:52,760
I'm just...

553
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:56,331
asking you how you feel about this.

554
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,461
I want to see them,

555
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,831
but that military guy was weird.

556
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,130
Why? What was weird?

557
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:05,300
It's just a feeling.

558
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,740
I think he's interested in you.

559
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,311
He asked me how you had been.

560
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:13,010
And he asked me if you were sick.

561
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,441
I see.

562
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,231
Will this do?

563
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:45,280
It might be dangerous outside.

564
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,880
I'll be back soon.

565
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
What about Seo Yoon?

566
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,760
That's for her parents.

567
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,211
If you're worried about her leaving alone,

568
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,411
you can come out with her.

569
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,541
I don't know
when she will have the chance to see her...

570
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,880
Why are you here?

571
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,920
I came here to find a possibility...

572
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,351
no matter how small to resolve this situation.

573
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,851
It looks like you came here to get me.

574
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,121
But I don't get why.

575
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,931
Does it have to do with this?

576
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,561
You can say that.

577
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,541
We found an antibody in your body.

578
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,911
We must check first
if the antibody will work.

579
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:53,481
If need be,

580
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:56,481
I'll even make you get bitten.

581
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,311
Don't shoot!

582
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,610
What?

583
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,311
Didn't you hear a gunshot just now?

584
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,510
We're under martial law.

585
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,780
It might have been a warning shot.

586
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,490
Yi Hyun.

587
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,791
Aren't you close to Han Tae Seok?

588
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,831
No.

589
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,360
Hey. Can you ask him...

590
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,061
to take me with him when he leaves?

591
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,570
This is getting to me.

592
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,470
Are you worried about your wife?

593
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,141
Okay. I'll ask.

594
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:04,110
I'm sure she's fine. Don't worry.

595
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,391
Didn't you say Kim Seung Beom was dead?

596
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:15,461
Yes. He's...

597
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:18,231
(Seyang Forest Le Ciel Apartment)

598
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:30,271
What the...

599
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:36,311
They cut out his brain.

600
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,181
Why would they do that to a dead person?

601
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,391
We're looking for an antibody
that can get into the brain.

602
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:45,791
Until then, a cure...

603
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,490
can't be made.

604
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:50,030
It's taking a long time to heal.

605
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:52,961
You don't have to worry
until it starts to change colour.

606
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,300
The virus is harmless...

607
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,200
until it reaches the brain.

608
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:58,271
They took Sae Bom...

609
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,941
to find the antibody.

610
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,181
You stay here.

611
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:12,351
If Han Tae Seok comes, stop him.

612
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,170
Seo Yoon.

613
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,311
Why are you out here?
It's dangerous. Go back in.

614
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:42,050
I heard gunshots.

615
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,751
Is Sae Bom okay?

616
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,751
She grabbed a pair of scissors
before leaving...

617
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,320
to hand over my letter.

618
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:49,320
Let's go inside.

619
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,920
Sae Bom is a better fighter than me.

620
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,331
You know that, right?

621
00:41:57,191 --> 00:41:59,001
So you don't have to worry.

622
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:01,630
Go home and lock the door.

623
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,271
I'll be right back. Okay?

624
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:33,360
Sae Bom.

625
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,501
Sae Bom is sick. Move over.

626
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:04,260
Sae Bom got hurt.

627
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,530
Han Tae Seok took her.

628
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:07,661
Darn it.

629
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:20,081
Target secured. I'm going up.

630
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,050
Don't pity...

631
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:26,021
the infected.

632
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,820
They can control their thirst...

633
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:30,691
if they want.

634
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,200
If you laid a hand on Sae Bom,

635
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,400
I'm going to kill you.

636
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,441
Stay still, if you don't want to die.

637
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,820
That tranquillizer was strong enough
to put an elephant to sleep.

638
00:44:32,981 --> 00:44:34,780
I guess I'm better than an elephant.

639
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,621
I'm letting you off
because you didn't kill that man.

640
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:57,041
Sae Bom. Let me look at you.
Did you get hurt?

641
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,041
It's okay. I'm fine.

642
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,541
Calm down.

643
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,610
First Lieutenant Lee.

644
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,851
It's been a while.

645
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,621
Tell them to put their guns down
if they don't want any trouble.

646
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:14,691
Put your guns down.

647
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,970
Ms. Yoon.

648
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,880
What will you do to get tested?

649
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,481
Why you little...

650
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:41,720
Hey.

651
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:04,099
I'm not doing this because I like you.

652
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,139
I'm doing this because you said
it would help find a cure.

653
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:10,608
Thank you.

654
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:19,248
Hold on.

655
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:22,288
Can you...

656
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:24,259
prepare some packed meals for the residents?

657
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:25,588
One with a lot of meat.

658
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,288
And I heard that you took...

659
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:31,458
Kim Seung Beom's body.

660
00:46:33,128 --> 00:46:35,369
I know you need to get rid of it
because of protocol,

661
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,038
but please tell his family.

662
00:46:41,038 --> 00:46:45,079
The situation outside isn't good,
so it'll take time to contact them.

663
00:46:48,818 --> 00:46:49,818
And my mom...

664
00:46:49,878 --> 00:46:51,788
Your mom is well in a nursing home.

665
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,659
Lieutenant Colonel Han took care of it.
Don't worry.

666
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:02,329
Why did you cut into Kim Seung Beom's brain?

667
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,329
Were you looking for the antibody?

668
00:47:06,898 --> 00:47:09,898
I told you
that the mad person disease affects the brain.

669
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:12,409
When we examine an infected person's blood,

670
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:14,639
we sometimes find the antibody.

671
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:17,639
However, it can't get through to the brain.

672
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:20,108
Their body has the antibodies,

673
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,648
but they can't get through to the brain
which is the problem.

674
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,418
So that's why you cut into
the infected people's brains?

675
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,119
To see if the antibody is in there?

676
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:30,458
What about Sae Bom?

677
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,788
Were you going to cut into her brain?

678
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:39,199
No.

679
00:47:39,498 --> 00:47:40,599
I needed to get a blood sample.

680
00:47:40,668 --> 00:47:42,239
I can do that test with her blood.

681
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,038
Can you...

682
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:51,108
make the cure with Sae Bom's blood?

683
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,949
We found a new monoclonal antibody
in Sae Bom's blood.

684
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:02,358
We need to run some more tests,

685
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:05,788
but there's a chance
it'll make its way to the brain.

686
00:48:06,288 --> 00:48:09,529
That means that Sae Bom is very important
for the sake of Korea.

687
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,299
There's a possibility.

688
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,268
Then can you give me some weapons?

689
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:15,639
So I can protect Sae Bom.

690
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:19,409
Will you be okay?

691
00:48:21,509 --> 00:48:22,639
About what?

692
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:25,409
We're not sure about the antibody yet.

693
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:27,549
Sae Bom can exhibit symptoms at any time.

694
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:29,619
That's why I need to keep her by my side,
so I can watch her.

695
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:30,818
Right next to me.

696
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:36,288
Yi Hyun!

697
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:40,259
Hey! I'm done!

698
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,898
I'm done taking her blood.

699
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:46,469
Let's go. I'll get you everything you want.

700
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:50,239
Why are you going to these lengths?

701
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,268
You even snuck into our apartment.

702
00:48:53,268 --> 00:48:55,478
Don't give me that nonsense
about how you want to save...

703
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:57,139
everyone who's been infected.

704
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:05,719
It's because of money.

705
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:09,989
A lot of wealthy and powerful people
have been infected too.

706
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:12,059
That's why I'm doing everything in secret.

707
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:13,529
If word gets out,

708
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:16,858
they won't hesitate to take all the blood
in Sae Bom's body...

709
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:19,299
to find a cure to save themselves.

710
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:20,869
If that happens,

711
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:23,668
the manufacture of the really profitable drug
will be delayed.

712
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:29,409
For you, it's money.

713
00:49:29,978 --> 00:49:31,009
For me, it's Sae Bom.

714
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:34,409
Don't come after us again.

715
00:49:35,009 --> 00:49:36,518
And when this is over,

716
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:39,588
I will expose you for what you are.

717
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:40,989
Be prepared.

718
00:49:44,088 --> 00:49:45,119
You do that.

719
00:49:46,128 --> 00:49:47,929
I'll pay for what I did.

720
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:03,108
Hey.

721
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:06,708
- Guys.
- Mister.

722
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:08,509
You can't smoke here.

723
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:09,949
Let us in.

724
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:17,518
Gosh.

725
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:25,668
Are you okay?

726
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:26,829
Yes.

727
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:30,369
Sae Bom had blood on her face.

728
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:32,708
It wasn't hers.

729
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:36,309
Don't worry, Jung Guk.

730
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,418
- Yi Hyun.
- Yes?

731
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:48,619
My gun.

732
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,159
Oh, right.

733
00:50:52,288 --> 00:50:53,288
Thanks a lot.

734
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:03,438
I heard something big had happened in the gym?

735
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,809
Is the fourth-floor lady okay?

736
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:08,909
I'll come over if we need help.

737
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:24,389
This will be enough.

738
00:51:28,998 --> 00:51:31,699
Can't you just eat what you're given?

739
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:35,699
I'm checking the date of expiry.

(Infectious Disease Emergency Relief Goods)

741

(Infectious Disease Emergency Relief Goods)

742
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:24,978
I thought he'd kill him,

743
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:28,049
but he shot a grazing blow
on the shoulder and stopped.

744
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:30,318
And he didn't wait until I got bitten.

745
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:38,559
Don't shoot!

746
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:21,938
He's still a jerk.

747
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,438
I know that,

748
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:25,809
but he...

749
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:28,978
seemed desperate too.

750
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:57,179
Four days.
That's how long we have to survive.

751
00:53:57,608 --> 00:54:00,108
Then everything will go back to normal.

752
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:17,159
The sixth-floor weirdo.

753
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:19,829
Will you cooperate with him?

754
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:24,599
No. He's a real nutcase.

755
00:54:26,469 --> 00:54:27,768
We need someone.

756
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:29,608
One with power...

757
00:54:30,608 --> 00:54:32,309
who will do as we say.

758
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:37,079
There's no such person.

759
00:54:47,628 --> 00:54:48,628
Yes?

760
00:54:48,898 --> 00:54:52,268
Is the reverend in?

761
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:56,498
I want to thank him for saving my life,

762
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,869
and I'd like to pray too.

763
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:05,608
Hello.

764
00:55:07,148 --> 00:55:08,208
Come in.

765
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:09,518
Thanks.

766
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:15,659
Will you just watch dramas?

767
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:18,518
What else can I do in here?

768
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:20,889
Take out the trash.

769
00:55:22,128 --> 00:55:24,299
You said you didn't like the smell.

770
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:27,068
Oh, my gosh.

771
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,248
I'm the best husband in the world.

772
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,768
Hello, Mr. Kook.

773
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,068
Oh, hello.

774
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,639
Are you taking out the trash too?

775
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,708
Yes.

776
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:12,309
You're staying with Oh Ju Hyung,
and he makes the guest work?

777
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:14,279
I'll take it.

778
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,849
- But...
- Come on.

779
00:56:31,498 --> 00:56:34,568
We can't throw it out properly
while we're under lock down.

780
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,699
What's the matter?

781
00:56:39,668 --> 00:56:41,309
Shall I take it down another flight?

782
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,978
I'm so scared.

783
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:48,608
Oh, dear.

784
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:51,049
What...

785
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:54,088
What's the matter?

786
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:59,329
Does Mr. Oh bother you?

787
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,199
Can you help me?

788
00:57:05,628 --> 00:57:06,628
Well...

789
00:57:17,378 --> 00:57:19,309
Where should we put the food waste?

790
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,978
In the freezer?

791
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:42,838
The fridge isn't a trash can. Give it to me.

792
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:44,699
Do you know where to leave it?

793
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,208
Are you crazy?

794
00:57:55,148 --> 00:57:56,478
We pay the maintenance fee.

795
00:58:14,568 --> 00:58:15,768
Oh Ju Hyung...

796
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,869
killed his wife.

797
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:21,369
- Did he really?
- Yes.

798
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:23,279
He told me.

799
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:26,779
If you don't help me,
he'll kill me too.

800
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:29,349
I thought I'd be fine
if I just got out of here,

801
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,018
but now we're under martial law.

802
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:34,818
Of course, I must help you.

803
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:37,719
I will protect you, Ms. Woo.

804
00:58:43,898 --> 00:58:47,068
I knew you wouldn't turn me away.

805
00:58:50,538 --> 00:58:52,768
Yes. You'll be okay.

806
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,418
What took you so long?

807
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:43,119
I took out the trash.

808
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,619
In that fancy dress?

809
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:47,088
This is my dress.

810
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:49,998
I can't keep wearing your wife's clothes.

811
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:53,898
Are you thirsty?

812
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:57,068
Don't worry. I'm not infected.

(Infectious Disease Emergency Relief Goods)

814
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,009
What should we do with Ms. Yoon's blood sample?

815
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:39,579
Run it only at a lab
that has level-three biosafety.

816
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,349
Yoon Sae Bom...

817
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:43,878
woke up after getting a tranquillizer shot.

818
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:49,559
But that much tranquillizer
should have put anyone to sleep.

819
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,518
The virus could have gotten into her brain.

820
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,628
Being able to recover quickly
is what the infected have in common.

821
01:00:56,728 --> 01:00:58,458
But the test results came out clean.

822
01:01:00,168 --> 01:01:02,299
It's possible that her body has working antibodies.

823
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:05,438
Proceed carefully,
so the higher-ups don't get wind of this.

824
01:01:05,668 --> 01:01:07,909
No one can go after her
before we can develop the cure.

825
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:09,538
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

826
01:01:10,478 --> 01:01:11,679
How are...

827
01:01:11,978 --> 01:01:13,108
Park Seo Yoon's parents?

828
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:14,978
Her father's symptoms have advanced.

829
01:01:15,378 --> 01:01:17,219
But her mother is only showing mild symptoms.

830
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:36,768
Give this to him when he feels better.

831

(To Mom and Dad)

832
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:44,239
It will help a bit.

833
01:02:04,628 --> 01:02:05,829
Seo Yoon.

834
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:07,628
Yes. I'm coming!

835
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:22,208
Hey. This...

836
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,179
Can I eat this?

837
01:02:25,748 --> 01:02:27,918
Will they really cut off the power?

838
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:29,659
Yes, they will.

839
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:32,188
Goodness.

840
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:34,829
You know,

841
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:38,529
you took care of the fridge
as if you were taking care of a shrine.

842
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:41,699
Hey, it's nice to have this much food
at times like this.

843
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,969
We can eat doenjang out...

844
01:02:45,038 --> 01:02:47,068
on the balcony, right?

845
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:48,969
I made it myself.

846
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:50,809
It's better than the store-bought ones.

847
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:01,518
Gosh.

848
01:03:01,588 --> 01:03:02,818
Sir. Ma'am.

849
01:03:03,588 --> 01:03:04,788
I'll get going.

850
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:06,389
Why?

851
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:08,489
Dong Hyun isn't coming out.

852
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,628
By the way, do you have a place to go?

853
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:15,568
I should go to the second floor.

854
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:19,239
I heard you caused trouble there.

855
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:21,338
Are you sure you're welcome there?

856
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,809
Stay safe then.

857
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:30,818
Gosh. You...

858
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:32,788
Goodness.

859
01:03:34,188 --> 01:03:35,949
Then take care.

860
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,329
Goodness. You are so heartless.

861
01:03:41,529 --> 01:03:43,498
Dong Hyun is just like you.

862
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:50,739
Hey.

863
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:53,909
We have an empty room.

864
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:56,938
If you want to stay here, you can.

865
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:58,438
Really?

866
01:03:58,779 --> 01:04:00,009
Thank you.

867
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:02,779
Thank you so much.

868
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,759
Soo Min!

869
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:19,228
Hey, Hyun Kyung.

870
01:04:21,068 --> 01:04:23,799
Hey. I'm all right.

871
01:04:23,869 --> 01:04:25,469
I just wanted to let you know that.

872
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,739
Do you have a place to sleep?

873
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:32,949
I'm...

874
01:04:34,108 --> 01:04:35,748
just scared a bit.

875
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:38,648
But I can't go in there.

876
01:04:39,378 --> 01:04:41,449
I don't know what I might do to you.

877
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,288
Soo Min.

878
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,059
I'm sorry.

879
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:51,358
Hey, don't say that.

880
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,659
Why are you sorry?

881
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:54,369
Why are you sorry?

882
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,568
It's all my fault.

883
01:05:00,168 --> 01:05:01,809
Hyun Kyung.

884
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:03,538
Can I...

885
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:05,338
ask you one thing?

886
01:05:06,849 --> 01:05:08,049
If I...

887
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:10,719
If I end up...

888
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:14,619
If something happens to me,

889
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:19,759
please look after...

890
01:05:21,688 --> 01:05:22,958
my family.

891
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:28,799
Soo Min.

892
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:31,038
You're going to be okay.

893
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:33,337
They said the cure would be ready soon.

894
01:05:33,338 --> 01:05:34,409
Hang in there...

895
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,108
Soo Min. What?

896
01:05:58,259 --> 01:05:59,628
(Wife: Come back quickly.
I got a message from the hospital.)

897
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:01,228
(But I'm scared to go alone.)

898
01:06:01,299 --> 01:06:02,728
(Wait for me.)

899
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,199
(Give me a bit more time.)

900
01:06:05,168 --> 01:06:06,469
Just a bit more.

901
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:07,938
Give me a bit more time.

902
01:06:14,748 --> 01:06:16,108
It's so good.

903
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:20,119
Really?

904
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:22,219
Let me taste some too.

905
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,188
It's pretty good.

906
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:29,829
I told you.

907
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:31,799
I know best when it comes to food.

908
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:02,429
Watch your fingers. It's still hot.

909
01:07:04,828 --> 01:07:06,028
You're eating with gusto.

910
01:07:06,868 --> 01:07:08,028
Isn't it good?

911
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:09,469
It's good.

912
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:51,878
=Happiness=

913
01:08:08,759 --> 01:08:10,729
There might be more infected people inside.

914
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,399
I saw something weird.

915
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:13,969
Where did you find this?

916
01:08:14,328 --> 01:08:16,198
She has a wound on her hand.

917
01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:17,338
Dad.

918
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,868
Mom is acting strange.
You know that, right?

919
01:08:19,368 --> 01:08:20,809
He's inside, right?

920
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:23,408
You're secretly harbouring an infected person.

921
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:26,078
It's better to get rid of the infected quickly.

922
01:08:26,849 --> 01:08:28,479
Did you drug the water?

923
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:30,479
I only need the two of you to die.

924
01:08:30,549 --> 01:08:32,219
The rest of them is a bonus.

925
01:08:34,049 --> 01:08:36,248
How could you come up
with a messed-up thought like that?

926
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:46,899
I'm Ryu Su Yeol.

927
01:08:47,368 --> 01:08:49,099
Do you think I'm working hard
just to get a promotion?

928
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,299
Bye.

929
01:08:50,538 --> 01:08:51,668
(Ryu Su Yeol, a social climber and detective)

930
01:08:52,538 --> 01:08:53,668
Come back here now!

931
01:08:54,738 --> 01:08:55,939
I want to beat you to a pulp.

932
01:08:56,009 --> 01:08:57,337
But I'm busy. Okay?

933
01:08:57,338 --> 01:09:00,378
Bad and Crazy premières on December 17.
