of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920
Don't expect rewards.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.360
Even though you saved me,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.170
you don't have to mention it every time.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.400
Have you seen Qin Shi?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.130
How's it going?

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.920
He was also poisoned with datura flowers.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.680
It causes hallucinations.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.240
He was alone with the Chairman Song.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.720
He should be the murderer.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.050
What is he eating?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:11.920
Didn't you notice

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.680
that you hit us?

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.610
I'm sorry.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.200
Someone is selling the great painter Li Ye's paintings.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.160
I'm in a rush.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.200
I'm sorry.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.330
Those painters are not good at painting.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.330
But they are good at making money.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.850
The times are degenerating.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.400
The people are corrupted.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.670
Let's have a look.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.240
Out of the way.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.130
These are all mine.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.090
What are you?

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.720
Um.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.160
What kind of painting is this?

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.400
I want one.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.030
What painting is this?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.570
This painting...

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.720
Are there any other paintings?

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.680
Have a look.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.440
Since joining the Jibei Chamber of Commerce,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.680
I've been the Chairman's bodyguard.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.200
Now,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.680
I killed him.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.920
How am I supposed

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.890
to live?

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.370
Mr. Chairman.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.650
This should be the murder weapon.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.850
Nice sword.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.160
What a pity.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.160
Keep it sealed

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.530
as physical evidence.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.610
Yes.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.000
I've been on adventures for years.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.610
I've never seen

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.480
such a sharp weapon.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.530
Gu Tian.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.170
You're kind of an expert on weapons.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.010
Analyze it.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.420
Could Qin Shi's sword

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.160
cut Song Jingye into pieces

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.050
in an instant?

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.370
Besides, the wounds are smooth,

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.890
with no scars.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.130
No way.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.290
That sword is not the murder weapon.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.160
Qin Shi is not the murderer.

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.290
Then who is the murderer?

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:15.920
Wait.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.480
It's not right.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.240
Think again.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.570
What's so weird about it?

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.680
Weird?

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.240
Speaking of weird things,

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.480
the painting is the most weird.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.610
But we've found out

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.680
the secret of the painting.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.090
Didn't you say that people who entered

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.000
were hallucinating

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.480
because the people below

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.530
lit the charcoal?

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.160
Charcoal.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.160
Charcoal.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.120
That's right.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.810
Charcoal. That's right.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.770
I know what the problem is.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.730
The mansion has been abandoned for five years.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.680
But there was plenty of charcoal.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.570
And the mansion is well-preserved.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.770
Most importantly,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.490
there are no broken doors.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.640
This is the weirdest point.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.680
Are you saying

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.570
that the mansion looks abandoned,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.920
but it's not,

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.160
and there are people living in it?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.880
That explains

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.600
why everyone who enters

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.290
gets poisoned.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.320
It shows that someone inside was up to something.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.160
Your Excellency, I didn't know it was you.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.920
I'm sorry.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.910
[Like the Rising Sun]
Sage Zhu, whom His Excellency has been looking for years,

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.010
died in Shangyi.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.900
His Excellency ordered you to post a bounty notice

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.320
about the Bird Jade Plate.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.250
Li Zhizhuo,

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.680
you know what to do next, right?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.770
I know.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.490
No matter who has the jade plate,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.120
if he wants money,

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.840
he will take the bait.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.120
You're not that stupid.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:23.640
Your Excellency.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.880
There's one more thing.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.290
The traitor we've been looking for years

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.320
appeared in the Lin's Mansion.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.730
Do you want me to take him down?

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.900
The Treasure of the Sealed Book is important.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.460
Do what you have to do.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.650
Don't meddle

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.090
in anything else.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.240
Yes.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.170
Your Excellency.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.330
I've been working

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.650
for the organization in Xichuan for years.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.960
When can I return to the lord?

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.720
Are you saying that Qin Shi may not be the murderer?

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.440
There is a mysterious person in this mansion.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.200
To solve this case,

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.330
the person is the breakthrough.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.000
Your finger is cut.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.520
What is that?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.650
The dust of Star Gold.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.800
Why is this thing here?

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.760
It must be from the murder weapon.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.760
Who's so rich

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.200
that he used Star Gold to make a weapon?

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.370
Do you remember

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.800
what Qin Shi said?

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.800
Song Jingye and Qin Shi

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.000
chased up to the second floor.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.090
But he died on the ground floor.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.370
It means

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.720
there's something wrong with the roof.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.130
Let's go up and have a look.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.440
Look.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.530
There are indentation marks in the wood.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.850
Normal nets

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.520
can't bear the weight.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.130
And the net is strong.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.000
After listening to you,

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.690
it's possible.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.480
You need to get the Western tussah silk.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.760
Then, weave it into a net.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.000
To leave

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.520
such a deep mark,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.520
you need to cover it with the dust of Star Gold.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.240
Tussah silk.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.480
Star Gold.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.240
Do you have an idea?

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.520
He's rich.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.930
Wen Jue.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.650
Where does your Lord's Mansion

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.010
sell your Star Gold

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.010
every year?

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.840
Even if you have just come to Xichuan,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.120
you know Star Gold is expensive.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.420
Many people

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.030
risked their lives

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.440
to take it and leave Xichuan.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.450
If you ask me who has it,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.690
all I can say

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.930
is that anyone could have it.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.450
It's about ten meters high.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.980
Song Jingye fell

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.880
from a height of only ten meters.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.520
Even if it were wrapped in Star Gold and Tussah Silk,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.730
considering the height,

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.120
he shouldn't have been cut so neatly.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:15.850
Unless

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.600
he weighs 500kg.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.690
That means

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.250
the murderer must've pushed him down hard,

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.930
making him fall quickly.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.450
Gu Tian.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.650
Can you

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.560
do it?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.960
Are you crazy?

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.010
If I were that good,

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.490
I'd just kill Song Jingye.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.840
I wouldn't do that much work.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.540
I must have missed something.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.930
Let's look for it.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.680
Look.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.820
Each mark

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.520
is between the first and second floors,

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.600
and the height is basically the same.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.790
But this crack

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.170
is different.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.310
It looks

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.800
like a drag mark.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.430
Why?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.490
Look, guys.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.770
I think there was something here.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:30.730
Be careful.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.320
Someone did something to this railing.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.320
What does that mean?

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.260
It means

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.460
that with Song Jingye's weight,

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.420
even if he fell at this height,

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.770
he wouldn't have

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.370
been cut so neatly.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.000
It's like

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.370
someone formidably strong

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.240
threw several blades at Song Jingye at the same time

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.170
and cut him into pieces easily.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:00.930
I see.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:14.310
[Fair and Square]

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.440
Look.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.500
It's weird

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.610
that these two stone lions are here.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.610
The point is

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.240
that this base is the same size

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.990
as the square mark

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.610
upstairs.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.070
So,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.090
it should have been placed upstairs.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.240
You think

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.130
the murderer put the trap

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.000
on the lion.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.520
Then, he pushed the lion down from above

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.930
to drive the tussah silk

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.240
to Song Jingye, right?

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.000
Right.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.040
Young Mistress.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.610
This lion weighs at least 400kg.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.200
Even the three of us can't move it easily.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.000
Knock it down.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.800
Me?

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.330
You think very highly of me.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.650
Dig a hole next to it.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:06.690
Then, get below it and push.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.410
It should fall

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.370
easily.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.240
Mozi said,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.370
"Add weight"

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.800
"to one end of a beam,"

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.610
"the beam will tilt."

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.430
"The post and the weight doesn't match."

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.370
"If the beam is balance,"

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.520
"the end with the post is short, and the end with the weight is long."

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.440
"If you add the same weight to both ends,"

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.610
"the end with the post will go down,"

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:24.930
"and the post gains more weight."

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.330
I only understood the first half.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.170
That's enough.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.130
Come and knock it down.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.090
When it comes to hard labor,

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.040
you think of me.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.720
Can we count on your brain?

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.280
See?

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.930
It's so hard.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.610
What about now?

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.330
There should have

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.930
been four balls under it

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.520
in the four holes.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.540
It corresponds to the four grooves upstairs.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.890
In that case, a healthy man

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.960
can move the stone lion easily.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.480
Not to mention

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.000
a master with great internal power.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:11.650
Where are the balls?

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.970
They must have been smashed when it fell.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.730
How do you know that?

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.850
It's easy.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.250
It's the same as treating a patient.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.090
It's about observation, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.660
After we entered the Lin's Mansion,

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.280
we found that the two stone lions

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.370
were placed wrongly.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.960
I knew there was something wrong with it.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.890
This is "observation".

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.210
Then, we entered the building.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.090
I smelled blood on the beam.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.120
So, I deduced

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.840
that Song Jingye died nearby,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440
and

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.200
he was cut into pieces in the air.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:45.910
This is "auscultation and olfaction".

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.480
Then, we solved the secret

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.290
about the Golden Monkey.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.850
So, we were not confused

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.850
by the visions of the mansion.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.370
This is "inquiry".

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.680
The most important one

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:57.850
is "palpation".

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.850
Can you feel the mansion's pulse?

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.050
If this mansion was human,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.370
it would have wailed in pain.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.650
Let's go in again.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.810
Who

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.680
set up

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.760
this trap?

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.960
The trap

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:30.850
was not improvised.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.160
Only by forcing this mysterious person to show up

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.850
can we know the truth.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.570
Do you have a plan?

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.800
He's trying his best

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.450
to turn Lin's Mansion into a haunted mansion

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.440
because he doesn't want people to come in.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.130
He wants to live here comfortably.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.160
If we destroy the mansion,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.850
he will show up.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.850
What just passed?

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:18.290
It's a person.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:18.610
Chase.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.480
I'll go get Jiu.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.050
Be careful, you guys.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:21.680
Okay.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:26.960
There he is.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.570
We've taken the painting away.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.370
The monkey is gone again.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.440
Are we

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.720
poisoned again?

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.530
I smelled kerosene.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.810
Be careful.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.090
Run.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.810
Looks like the person behind this is about to reveal himself.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.330
Come on.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:47.960
Come on.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:55.680
Gu Tian.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.890
Show a part of your body.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.440
Let's see if we can seduce him to attack.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.240
Okay.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:04.680
Why don't you do it?

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:07.360
I'm a physician.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.530
If you're injured,

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.880
I can bandage you to stop the bleeding.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.710
If I'm injured,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:11.930
you will watch me die.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.610
That's right.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.680
Be careful.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.280
Did you see it?

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.010
Yes.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.160
Go.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:33.760
Are you all right?

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.560
I'm lucky.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.450
It's not poisonous.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.050
My clothes...

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:41.970
Go.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:11.680
Gu Tian.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.280
There is no light here.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320
It's not good for us.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.970
We can't go on like this.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.120
I have a good thing.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:00.790
Do you want to have a try?

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.930
What's that?

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.450
It can temporarily enhance your five senses.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.200
After eating it,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.530
you can see night as day.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:08.880
Why don't you eat it?

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.360
It's not perfect.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.280
Its properties are unstable.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.930
Why?

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.450
You'll see.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:18.760
How about it?

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:23.760
How do you feel?

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.530
I'll see

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.840
who you are.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.410
You're vicious.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.880
You wanted to kill us without saying anything.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:24.880
Too bad

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.280
I didn't get to kill you.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.010
I've been away from the Breakwall

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.450
for years.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:30.930
I hid from you.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.130
But you

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.140
wouldn't let me go.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.200
You...

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840
Don't talk.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.840
Let me do the talk.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.090
Okay.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.410
Now that you know who we are,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.200
you know

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.050
why we are here.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.320
Believe it or not,

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:53.970
I didn't say anything

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.800
about that year.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:32:59.720
Whether we believe it or not

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.240
is not up to you.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:04.450
What do you want to do?

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.530
He knows a secret method.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.760
He'll pierce a gold needle into your body.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.800
Holding the gold needle,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.570
he can tell

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:16.360
if you're lying.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.760
Nothing will happen if you're telling the truth.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.840
If you're lying...

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:22.720
What will happen?

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.280
The gold needle will follow your blood

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.970
and go all the way into your brain.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.490
What do you think will happen?

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.970
Kill me if you want to.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.720
Why bother?

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:36.320
If you're not afraid to die,

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.090
why are you hiding here?

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.010
You're being ridiculous.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.200
I don't know that.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.720
Go.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.240
Feel him out.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:50.650
Go.

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:09.880
Not bad.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:12.490
Your pulse is stable.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.410
Go ahead.

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:26.920
Tell us

00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:28.970
what the Breakwall is.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.140
You don't know the Breakwall?

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.650
Don't talk nonsense.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.130
We want to know if you're lying.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:36.800
Answer my question.

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:39.510
The Breakwall

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.290
was a mysterious organization

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.730
in Jibei.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.410
Lord Su Rang

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.320
and four other sages

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.970
served the Jibei Mansion.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.840
Right.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.320
Tell me about that year.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.010
I was nobody

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.610
in the Breakwall.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.970
There were a lot of things

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.250
I didn't know.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.740
I knew

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.570
there was a rebellion

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:08.200
in the Jibei Mansion.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:09.970
But very soon,

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.650
Jibei King

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.490
calmed the unrest

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.530
with the help of our lord.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.840
Since then,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.970
the young king

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.720
has changed his temperament.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.410
He spent every day in a daze.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.320
He even let our lord

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.010
take care

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.410
of court affairs.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.200
Why did you run away?

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.720
That year,

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.530
most of the people in our organization

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.650
who were involved in this

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:45.840
were killed.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.530
I was afraid of being killed.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:49.490
So, I found a way

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.280
to escape from the Breakwall.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:52.970
I used a painting

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.160
to fake my death to escape.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.880
Does Song Jingye's death

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.800
have anything to do with you?

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.800
Kind of.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.490
But

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.880
I just gave the murderer

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.720
a hand.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:12.610
Why?

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.090
I thought

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.930
the Breakwall sent him to kill me.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:27.760
The Cloud-shaped Jade.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.050
Why do you have it?

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.650
I found it

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.280
where Song Jingye died.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.010
I knew it was precious.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.320
I wanted

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.240
to give it to Her Excellency.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.050
I don't know

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.010
if she will spare my life.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.050
Who are you?

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.090
Senior.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.050
You're injured.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.980
Now that the fish is hooked,

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.130
it's time to catch it.
