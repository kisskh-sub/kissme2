00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.079
I really don’t want to leave you.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.359
First thing in the morning,

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.159
you’re already so sweet.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.560
Because in this world,

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.599
only you never criticize me,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.719
never blame me,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080
you just accept me unconditionally.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.960
I’ll be there at nine.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.919
Just a brief meeting.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.680
Don’t block my way.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.199
No.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.520
How come you’re all clingy in bed

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.120
and a brat as soon as you get off?

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.719
That’s separation anxiety.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.919
So you still can’t let me go.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.560
Who can’t let you go?

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.560
I meant the bed.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.560
I can’t leave it either.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.479
Every single character

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.159
needs a clear, sharp persona.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.199
This time,

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.319
I’m a Cantonese drifter in Beijing,

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.639
trying to make it in this strange

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:02.479
big city and find my footing,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.400
put down some roots.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.520
That’s quite a spread.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.520
Hands off my favorite chicken feet.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.840
Wait for my message.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.800
No problem.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:17.879
You just need to pretend

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.199
you’re really keen on the place.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.520
Do not overact, whatever you do.

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.000
I’m already in character.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.000
Come on, come on, come on!

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.960
In character, my ass.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.199
You’re just a shill.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.159
And you’ll shill me away, huh?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.280
I’d never.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.400
I won’t ditch you.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.039
I’ll

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.919
gnaw it clean.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.439
Just wait.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.840
It’ll come looking for you

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.840
to claim your life.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.360
Taste.

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.159
Taste it, just taste it.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.240
Screw you, damn it.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.719
There’s a trick to this.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.080
Of course there is.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.719
August twenty‑sixth.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.480
Got it, your birthday.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.959
Last quarter’s numbers were okay,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.480
so no bottom‑ranking layoffs.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.920
However,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.240
this morning I checked

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.319
our current headcount.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.120
It’s an odd number.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:03.759
My horoscope teacher said

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.319
even numbers bless me this month.

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.519
So one person still has to go.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.439
You understand?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.480
Who it’ll be,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600
I’ll weigh everything up

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.920
and tell you tomorrow.

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:18.680
All right.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.639
Meeting adjourned.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.560
Li Lili, stay behind.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.279
How’s the boss doing out of town?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.519
Busy going to nightclubs every day.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:38.879
Nightclubs?

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:40.240
I mean, it’s…

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.480
industry review and networking events.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.079
Don’t worry.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.920
I’ve packed his schedule

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.240
completely full.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.839
And at his hotel,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.319
I’ve squared things with the manager.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.319
Oh, right, sis—

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.240
these places

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.040
all work with my Sky Eye plan,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.639
the partner hotels and restaurants.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.920
If the boss crosses any red line there,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.879
I’ll get an alert at once.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.079
Okay.

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.279
Email me a copy later.

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:07.879
Sure thing.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.560
I’ll get going then, sis.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.279
Go on.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:21.319
Here,

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:21.959
have some tea.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.360
This is our best tea in the shop.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.279
Over 1,000 yuan a liang.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.319
So, what do you think?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.040
I need to think a bit more.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.680
Now is the best time to buy.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.399
Here we go.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.439
Lately,

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:54.240
my rhinitis has been acting up.

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:15.399
Hello, brother-in-law.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.079
Brother-in-law.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.480
Uh...

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.120
My English name is Jeff.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.240
This apartment...

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:27.680
I must have it.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.439
No...

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.319
Mr. Li, please have a seat.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.720
I have another client here.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.959
Please wait a little longer.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.360
I can't wait at all.

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:38.879
Brother...

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.279
This apartment...

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.519
Let me have it.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.399
Not long ago...

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.000
My brother-in-law in Hong Kong, China...

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.680
passed away.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.720
Brother-in-law...

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.279
Rest in peace.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.480
Your brother-in-law might be watching you right now.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.240
Let me tell you...

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.759
My brother-in-law had no children.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.759
He left me a large inheritance.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.439
I consulted a feng shui master...

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:09.879
from Victoria Peak.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.040
This apartment...

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.360
is very peaceful.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.639
This peaceful apartment...

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:14.519
I must have it.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.560
Bro...

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.600
This morgue...

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:16.920
No...

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.199
This peaceful apartment...

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:19.279
Give me the contract.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.120
Xiao Meng...

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:28.759
Look at this jerk you found.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.680
You think I'm a fool?

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:33.480
No...

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.799
No...

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.320
Brother Liang...

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.279
Bro...

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.080
I was wrong.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.279
You were indeed wrong.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.279
You completely failed...

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.480
to match my emotions.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.840
In one minute...

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.919
I switched through four emotions.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.360
Happiness, anger, sorrow, joy—all there.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.240
And you?

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.519
I forgive you.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:53.720
Next time I'll match you.

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:55.600
I'll try a more natural acting style.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.879
No, no, no...

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:58.799
My stage here is too small.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.879
Can't handle you.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.600
Wait...

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.399
There's a children's room.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.720
Perfect!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.080
Character development...

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.120
needs an anchor.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.960
I say...

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:12.360
I don't need it.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720
I've decided.

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:16.200
My next persona will be...

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.159
a single dad.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.600
I'll prepare right away.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.879
I'll use this new persona...

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:22.000
to win over your clients.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.399
I'm going to be a dad.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.000
Last month, three clients left me.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.799
They're not really going to fire me, right?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.120
Of course not.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.080
The boss lady said...

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.039
it's not decided yet.

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:50.720
Besides, you usually...

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.279
It's me.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.159
Right?

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.480
Right.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.519
Then you have to help me.

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.120
Put in a good word with Wu Mansha.

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:09.440
Why would she...

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.759
listen to me?

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.000
Everyone knows...

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.879
you're her confidant.

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:14.440
She even holds private meetings with you.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:14.960
No...

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.120
Just help me out.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.720
I really can't lose this job.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.600
No...

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600
To her...

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.440
my words carry no...

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:23.639
Please.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.799
Not this...

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.840
Baby, we're home now.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:42.399
Starting today,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.679
I’m your dad from now on.

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:44.600
I’ve thought of a

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.840
super cute name for you.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:46.600
You’ll be called Jenny.

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:47.519
Do you like it?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.279
You like it a lot.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.039
Here,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.679
let me pat your head.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:53.279
Li Cai.

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:56.320
Come here.

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:57.240
Coming.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:57.919
Don’t be scared.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.480
Slow down.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.200
Let’s go.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.120
Aunt Cai.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:07.840
What’s all this about?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.159
You’re even kneeling to beg me.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.000
Get up, come on.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.039
What if I can’t fix it?

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:11.960
Then you knelt for nothing.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.399
What the heck is this?

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.519
This is my son.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.039
Jenny.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.440
An alien.

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:17.759
A damn turtle.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.879
Father and son,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.039
different paths, same turtle.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.320
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.279
About this…

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.399
I’ll watch it next time.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:24.240
I’m off.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.360
Get back here.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.600
Help me pull my arm out.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.200
I knew something was off.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.600
You practicing walking through walls?

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.960
Then don’t stop halfway.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:34.960
Go all the way through.

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.000
Quick, Jenny, watch wall‑passing.

00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:36.720
Never seen that, right?

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:38.799
I don’t want to pass through.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:40.519
Help me, just

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.000
pull my arm back out.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.320
Fine, I’ll pull it out.

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:44.679
But first, can you tell me

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:46.480
why you’re in Uncle Meng’s room?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.559
Are you writing

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.360
or drawing,

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:55.080
what are you doing?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.720
You colored it all black.

00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:01.320
Your black eight never goes in.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.440
Looked so pitiful.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.960
So I made everything black.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.279
Seriously…

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.519
you’re way too idle.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:09.879
Don’t you always say our band

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.559
is a money‑losing joke?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.120
Here, take a look.

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:15.759
We made money, we did!

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.320
You finally sold all the instruments?

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:20.360
What are you talking about?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.639
Senior College talent show

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.799
prize money.

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:24.279
How much?

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:25.320
Five hundred.

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:27.799
To sign up for this event,

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:28.960
how much was the fee?

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:32.440
One thousand.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.879
Quit that snarky tone.

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:37.159
You’re just flat‑out jealous.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.639
We’ve got nothing in common.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:39.360
Honestly…

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.759
That one thousand we spent,

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.000
that was money.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.440
This five hundred we got back

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.360
is honor.

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:53.360
Honor.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.360
You definitely don’t get it.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.159
As long as you’re happy.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.000
Still guarding against me.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.639
You’re so damn stingy.

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:17.480
You’re still too green.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.279
It’s stuck.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.600
It’s stuck.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:50.000
So you like Uncle Meng?

00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:53.559
Wait till I pull my arm out.

00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:54.799
Then I'm totally beating you up.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.080
Then I’m definitely not helping.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.519
I won’t hit you.

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:57.440
Okay, I won’t, I won’t.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:58.120
Come on, come on.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.759
Don’t hit me, okay?

00:14:58.759 --> 00:14:59.559
Come on, come on.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.000
Come.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
One, two, three.

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.279
Go.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.799
My arm’s gonna snap off.

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:07.320
No.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.120
Just use your superpower.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.279
I haven’t used it in ages.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:11.840
Jam.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.639
It’s bugged out.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:15.039
Otherwise…

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.840
go find a big hammer.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.639
Let’s smash the wall down.

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:19.639
That’s a load‑bearing wall.

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:21.080
If it falls, we’re both darn it.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.360
Then what do we do?

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.799
We wait till your power comes back.

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:26.679
That’ll take over ten hours.

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:28.399
What am I supposed to do now?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.159
Today,

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:30.200
I’ll take care of you.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.759
That way,

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:33.320
my persona gets more nuanced.

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:35.240
I’m not just a single dad.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.320
At the same time,

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.639
I’ve also got an elderly

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.519
mother who can’t care for herself.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.559
Come, Jenny.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.759
Call her Grandma.

00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:43.519
You little punk.

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:44.759
I’m back.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.360
Old Meng’s back.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.000
Quick, quick!

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.720
Stop him, hurry!

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.639
Don’t let him see me.

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:49.159
Okay.

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:50.120
Go, go, go, hurry.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.960
Hurry up, go.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:54.240
Uncle Meng’s back.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.200
When did you get back?

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:57.600
What are you flustering about?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.039
I…

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.440
Look at your guitar.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:05.919
I was just—

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.639
What about my guitar?

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:08.519
This guitar’s great.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.320
You can feel it.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:16.799
What are you doing here?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.240
You’re just—

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.159
With such a nice guitar,

00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:19.840
I figured

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.960
I’d help tidy your place.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.759
Wait.

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:28.440
Uncle Meng,

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:30.279
um, you know…

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.120
let me explain.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.759
This is the one from my shop,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.039
the Ninja Turtle.

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:34.840
Ninja Turtle?

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.000
What’s that supposed to mean?

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.879
I thought I’d explain it to you.

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:38.960
I just borrowed it to help me

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.039
get into character.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:40.960
Jenny

00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:41.960
is my baby now.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.840
“Jenny Turtle,”

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:44.559
a magic pet.

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.799
Why’s it hanging there?

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.279
What?

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:49.519
Hanging what?

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:50.799
Why hang it there?

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:51.519
I…

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:52.519
was cleaning up.

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:53.279
I just put it there.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.080
Um…

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.039
don’t distract my cleaning.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.120
I’ll do it myself, I’d rather.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.879
That’s my foot rag.

00:16:57.879 --> 00:16:58.799
I’ve used it seven years.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.200
Don’t hang it by my bed.

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.359
Just chop my hand off.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.920
No, you’d better replace it fast.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.559
You, you—

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:06.960
Okay, okay.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.240
I’m working, I’m working, working.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.480
Weird.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:16.880
Xiaoli.

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:19.720
Take this back with you.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720
I can’t accept it.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.920
I get it now.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.559
I just felt I was wrong too.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.119
Yeah.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.160
We’re coworkers, this is not right.

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.680
I don’t even know what flavor you like.

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.079
You pick one yourself.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.599
No.

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:33.519
I really can’t take any.

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:35.119
Got it.

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:36.759
Take the whole box.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:39.000
Xiaoli, that’s not what I meant.

00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:39.640
Don’t worry.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.160
I’ll help you if I can.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.079
No need to bring me gifts.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.119
Understood.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.359
You really get it, okay?

00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:49.720
Hurry, take it back.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.400
Sure enough, she liked none of it.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.119
I’ll do it.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:33.960
I can.

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:34.759
I can handle it.

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:35.400
Didn’t I say

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400
I’d take care of you today?

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:37.680
Okay, okay.

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:41.839
Here, eat.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.440
All right.

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:44.920
Sleep.

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:46.440
Eat.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.720
Sleep.

00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:49.839
Eat.

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:51.880
Sleep.

00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:54.319
Eat.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.440
Sleep.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.279
How are you not done eating?

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:03.920
I can’t reach it.

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:05.559
Sorry.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.559
Here.

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:07.440
Let me feed you first.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.079
How’s that hand of mine?

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:10.880
Don’t worry.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:11.960
Nothing can go wrong.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.720
As long as you hold tight.

00:20:21.319 --> 00:20:23.039
Baby, let’s start brushing.

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:23.839
Where are your teeth?

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.200
Then let’s just take a bath.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.519
Let’s play some baby songs.

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.200
You’d better keep that little turtle

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:37.119
inside your head when you wash.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.920
How strong is the water flow?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.400
Why is there a kid crying?

00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:58.599
Has your little rascal turned into a demon?

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:01.200
I set three alarms for the night

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.079
to realistically simulate a baby crying.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.000
Darn it

00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:06.400
Your alarm is really annoying.

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:08.440
You’re back.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.079
Dad.

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:10.079
What’s going on?

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:11.839
Lili, you’re finally back.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.559
Don’t even mention it.

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.640
My colleague is such a handful.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.480
Work relationships are really hard.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.960
I get it.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.160
Totally get it.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.440
Come on, come on.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.200
Everyone, go back to your rooms.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.119
Go, go, go.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.160
What happened here?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.480
Mom, why are you sleeping here?

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:28.480
I… well…

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:31.519
I learned a little health trick.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.880
Got it.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.440
Saw it on some junk clickbait, right?

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:36.359
Sounds dodgy already.

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:37.559
Hurry and go sleep in your bed.

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:38.119
Stop.

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:40.200
I…

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.720
I’m sleeping right here.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.240
It gets my energy flowing.

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:44.799
Feels especially good.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.279
I see.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.960
You don’t like this bed.

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:49.519
How about this:

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:50.759
Tonight you share Lili’s room.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.880
That bed is softer.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
No, no, no need.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.200
I sleep better right here.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.400
I’m grounding myself here.

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:56.480
I understand.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.200
I’ll lay a pallet on the floor.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.480
So you can really “ground” yourself.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.680
Do you not understand human speech?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.559
I’m not going anywhere tonight.

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:05.079
I’m sleeping right here.

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:06.640
It’s no use.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.400
I’ve figured it out.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.799
Some people just can’t get you.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.480
I’ve told her over and over,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.440
spelled it out many times,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.680
and she still doesn’t get it.

00:22:14.839 --> 00:22:16.839
Maybe you should say it differently.

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:17.720
Say what?

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:19.599
Go chill wherever you can.

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:21.400
You don’t get to boss me around.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.079
Got it.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:25.960
That works.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.240
So that works too, huh.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.519
This light Li Cai installed for me,

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:57.640
how do I turn it off?

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.000
You have to remove the bulb.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.519
That’s way too much trouble.

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:30.519
This is an insulator.

00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:31.759
What’s the principle here?

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.839
Just you wait.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.240
It will come for you,

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:54.319
to claim your life.

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:31.799
Lili.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.640
I see you.

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:37.720
I’m really not surprised at all.

00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:40.000
You told me not to bring you gifts.

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:42.000
I thought you were hinting

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.279
I could bring them to your home.

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:43.880
Right?

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.000
Wrong.

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:48.200
I was being very direct.

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:49.640
Watch my lips.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.599
I

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.920
do not need

00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:52.920
any gifts.

00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:54.599
You just

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.039
go chill wherever you can, okay?

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:09.759
Work relationships are so hard.

00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:12.000
Come in.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.519
Have a seat.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.599
I’m sorry, Lili.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.799
Honestly, I don’t get it either.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.680
The workplace…

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:27.839
I learned all this from clickbait posts.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.039
What?

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.759
You must give gifts to get things done.

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:33.079
There is no boss who refuses gifts,

00:25:33.079 --> 00:25:34.920
only staff who don’t know how to give.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.319
It’s just…

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:39.039
What are you doing here?

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.559
You two know each other?

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:42.240
Yeah.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.279
Just now,

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:44.559
I was downstairs sunning the baby,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.720
and we chatted for quite a while.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.599
We shared lots of parenting tips.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:48.799
Right.

00:25:49.079 --> 00:25:50.319
Men taking care of kids

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:51.680
are already rare.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.920
If my daughter’s dad

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.079
could be like him,

00:25:54.079 --> 00:25:55.359
we wouldn’t have split up.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.559
Split up?

00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:58.799
Yeah.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:00.240
I’m a single mom now.

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.400
I have to work,

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.680
and look after the kid.

00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:05.279
Life’s already really hectic.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.920
But for the sake of living,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.240
I can only slog on, no matter what.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.799
Meaning,

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:12.279
whether I’m

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.480
tired to death or crushed by work,

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:15.519
I still can’t quit.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.240
Don’t worry.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.119
My sister will help you.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.440
And I can help watch the baby too.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.000
You’re such a good dad.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.920
But keeping a kid cooped up

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.039
like this really isn’t good.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.480
Jenny.

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:30.799
You must want to go back to your bed.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.519
Right?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.319
Seems you’re really

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:33.480
a little homebody in a big rush.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.880
My younger brother

00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:35.920
is the one raising him.

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:36.680
The turtle.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.240
You sit, don’t mind me.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:07.759
Why am I being dragged in?

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:10.079
I can’t end up jobless either.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.480
My skills are kind of coming back.

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:33.160
One more.

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:34.519
One.

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.240
Two.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.279
I just had a dream.

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:57.680
Where’s my red envelope?

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:13.680
Let go.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.960
Of my hand.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.599
How did it go through?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.359
When is the client coming?

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.240
I’m ready.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.680
I’m done.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.720
The contract’s signed.

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:50.559
The client booked me in advance.

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:51.880
It went extremely smoothly.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.440
Didn’t need you this time.

00:28:56.359 --> 00:28:58.000
You secretly booked them behind my back?

00:28:58.359 --> 00:28:58.920
Didn’t you?

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.319
Keep your voice down.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.359
I slave away at home with the baby—

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.680
for what?

00:29:04.839 --> 00:29:06.400
Isn’t it all to help you succeed?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.400
But you?

00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:09.160
You used me and the baby.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.440
No.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.599
It’s not what you two think.

00:29:11.599 --> 00:29:12.079
No.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.440
Brother‑in‑law,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.119
you’ve let me down.

00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:16.839
I hate you!

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.079
I’m your brother‑in‑law,

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:22.519
not your uncle‑in‑law.

00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:23.880
This…

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.759
No…

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.599
It’s not…

00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:29.839
It really isn’t what you think.

00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:30.960
Th‑this, this…

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:42.799
Sis,

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.200
this is for you.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.599
So thoughtful.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.039
Um…

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.880
Has the layoff list come out?

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680
Why are you so nervous?

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.559
It’s not you anyway.

00:29:56.119 --> 00:29:56.839
Okay.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.599
I’ll get back to work then, Sis.

00:29:58.839 --> 00:29:59.480
Go on.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.880
No way, sis.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.240
You can't fire Xiaoli either.

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:11.160
She usually works really hard.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.279
She caught that last mistake in time.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.440
How do you know I plan to fire Xiaoli?

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.640
I...

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.200
accidentally

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:23.880
saw the list.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.400
I'm on it too.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.119
I haven't made any mistakes.

00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:29.039
You haven't, true,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.079
but the boss is doing well now.

00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:32.359
That Sky Eye system you set up,

00:30:32.359 --> 00:30:33.440
once I fully took it over,

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.559
I don't really need you anymore.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.400
Redundant asset,

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.160
can be discarded.

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:37.160
No, wait,

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.519
doing a good job

00:30:38.519 --> 00:30:40.200
can be a reason to get fired?

00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:41.920
That's ridiculous.

00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:44.680
Still,

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:45.680
I checked,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.400
you two earn so little.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.000
Fire you or not, it hardly matters.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.839
Forget it.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.680
You...

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.160
My mood’s been a roller coaster.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.200
Thanks, sis.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.799
I'll hurry and tell Xiaoli.

00:30:57.839 --> 00:30:58.599
She just got divorced.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.839
She can't lose her job too.

00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:01.519
Wait.

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:04.000
Come here.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.480
So she's a single mom now?

00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:07.640
Yeah.

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:09.440
Sis, maybe give her a raise?

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:10.279
And while you're at it,

00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:11.160
give me one too.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.440
Tell Xiaoli right away

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:14.039
to go resign at HR.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.640
What do you mean?

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.119
In her situation,

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:18.559
the time she can give to work

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:19.680
will definitely decrease.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.559
Bad asset

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:21.440
must be cut.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.359
Go.

00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:37.880
Li Cai.

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:39.279
Got a minute?

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.680
Got a case?

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:50.160
First time

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.079
the firing reason is feng shui.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:52.880
Right.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.880
The boss’s wife says evens are lucky.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.799
Now it's an odd number.

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:56.799
So one must go.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.400
The second reason to fire her

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.880
is she has to look after her kid,

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.000
might affect her work.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.680
She’s a single mom.

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:05.519
Yeah.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.279
Isn't odd supposed to be unlucky?

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:11.240
That's what the boss’s wife said.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.400
Li Lili.

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:14.720
Wait for me a bit.

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:16.400
Sis.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:18.319
What is she here for?

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:20.519
To ask about decorating.

00:32:20.759 --> 00:32:22.160
She didn't ask about decoration.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.559
Yeah.

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:24.720
She’s really gossipy.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.480
She kept chatting with me

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.680
about Liu Xiaoli getting fired.

00:32:28.319 --> 00:32:29.759
Are you stupid?

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:33.759
Hi, sis.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.000
Hello.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.640
You are...?

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:39.279
I’m here to ask about decorating.

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:43.880
Then let me explain it to you.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.240
No need.

00:32:45.319 --> 00:32:46.279
This young lady

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:47.680
explained everything clearly.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.240
She did?

00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:51.559
Sis, don’t worry.

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:52.880
I did a great job explaining.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.119
She’s very satisfied.

00:32:56.319 --> 00:32:57.680
You this free?

00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:00.200
No,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.880
I’m quite busy.

00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:03.880
Then go get busy, sis.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.079
I’ll stay here.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960
Be smart.

00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:09.839
Okay.

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:11.079
Relax.

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:18.079
Do you have any other cases like that

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:19.599
around here

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:20.839
We do

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.799
For example

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.920
For example

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920
Like firing people

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.200
Aren’t you Li Guess

00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:28.720
What are you doing here

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:29.839
I’m waiting for Director Cai

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.640
I started a pastry shop business

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.519
I fired a pregnant single mom

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:34.359
and she sued me

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.480
She’s in charge of the probe

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.519
If it’s confirmed as true

00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:37.519
I’ll get a heavy penalty

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:41.279
So my guess was right

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.440
She’s from Labor Inspection

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.119
Can you put in a word for me

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.599
I can only speak up for myself

00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:49.720
Li Lili

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.160
Li Lili

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.480
Message Liu Xiaoli right away

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:53.960
Tell her

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.880
I’ll raise her annual pay by 30%

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.240
And no overtime on weekends

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.839
For women with special situations

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.000
we must give full care and support

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.359
Okay

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.160
Sure

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:05.400
I’ll get going

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:07.599
Take care, sis

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.360
Take care

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.199
Director Cai, I…

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:10.920
It’s me, Xiao Li

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.960
We’ve fixed everything at the shop

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.119
Hired lots of chefs this time

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.360
Could you please not fine us

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.800
Starting up wasn’t easy for me

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.400
I’ll go right now

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.760
Immediately

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:26.880
All right

00:34:28.519 --> 00:34:29.320
I’ll go this way

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.679
Hurry up

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.039
Hurry up

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:50.199
Dad

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:52.119
Dad

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.400
Dad

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.719
It’s not that much trouble

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:03.840
Who

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.719
hit me

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.480
I just

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.079
had a dream

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:21.519
Yeah

00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:23.440
You hit yourself just now too

00:35:28.519 --> 00:35:30.559
I left a red envelope here

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.639
You’re dreaming

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:47.000
You didn’t rest well

00:35:48.039 --> 00:35:48.880
Sleep a bit more

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.559
Nice vase

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.480
Just bought it

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.559
Look

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.599
Xiaoli and her daughter painted it

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:31.199
I really like this present

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.840
Though I don’t have many scenes

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:39.159
I’m still the director

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:40.360
Without my direction

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.559
Aunt Cai couldn’t play her role

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:43.760
And in the end

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.480
I didn’t get any gift at all

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:46.760
They didn’t even paint me

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.880
It’s fine

00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:55.880
Just be an unsung hero

00:36:57.079 --> 00:36:57.880
Unsung

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.800
Nice character setting

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.719
Next

00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:02.679
I’ll play a low‑key

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:04.239
hero who bears every hardship

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.559
You two

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:06.519
got any references for me

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.760
Earthlings are way too complicated.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.480
Back on my home planet, when I worked,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.039
I just needed to finish my tasks.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.400
I never had to worry about

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.679
what my boss was thinking,

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:29.280
or what he thought I thought of him,

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.639
or what he thought I thought of him,

00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:31.880
or what he thought of me.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480
What are you even talking about?

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:35.880
Compared with Earthlings,

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.039
my people are simple like idiots.

00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:39.280
Take me, for example.

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:41.239
My boss at the editorial office,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.559
besides assigning me work,

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:43.920
just chats with me, nothing else.

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:45.199
He talks to me whenever he’s free,

00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:46.079
asking things like,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.760
“What’s human hallucinogen alcohol

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.960
actually taste like?

00:37:49.159 --> 00:37:51.639
What’s that magical tipsy feeling?”

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.760
And he kindly tells me, too,

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.960
that in human society,

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.920
subordinates often gift booze to bosses.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:57.920
Isn’t that great?

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.920
There’s zero mental friction between us.

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:00.559
Wait, no.

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:01.599
Have you never considered

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:03.320
that your boss is hinting at you?

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.599
Talking about alcohol like that, he’s

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:05.719
obviously implying something.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.960
Of course I picked up on that.

00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:09.320
Today he even told me

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.800
the interstellar delivery procedure,

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.920
plus his home address.

00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:13.559
Could it be any more obvious?

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:14.760
I just got back from the bar.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.519
There you go, that’s it.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.599
Why would I mail him alcohol?

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.360
What’s the point of sending booze?

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:20.159
I packed Da Liu in an astro-crate

00:38:20.159 --> 00:38:21.119
and shipped him over to my boss.

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:23.039
Didn’t he want to learn about booze?

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.079
Da Liu’s a total booze guru.

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:26.400
He’ll explain everything in one go.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.679
So, how’s that?

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:29.639
How many layers deep was that play?

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:31.079
You’re in the basement.
